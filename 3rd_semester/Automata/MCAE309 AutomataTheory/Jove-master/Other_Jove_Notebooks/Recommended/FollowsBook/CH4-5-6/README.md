Here are the Youtube videos to watch and Jove
notebooks to run in order to learn more about DFA:

1) Run CH4-5-6.ipynb and hopefully you'll know what all one can do with DFA


2) Experiment with the Jove notebook
   ../../notebooks/driver/Drive_DFA.ipynb
   to benefit from the automd markdown, and
   the md2mc converter

3) Experiment with the Jove notebook
   ../../notebooks/module/Module3_DFA.ipynb
   to know how to define DFA using a Python
   dictionary data structure. This can be painful
   to type in. The automd syntax is much better,
   as illustrated by the "md2mc" command whose
   usage is illustrated within Drive_DFA.ipynb.

4) Watch [the first DFA lecture](https://youtu.be/FItN6CK1mow) in Fall 2018 if you wish to get an overview

Be sure to look up the book's Appendix-B to see
what commands pertain to DFA operations (it lists
Jove commands going chapterwise)

5) New: We also illustrate another DFA construction
   in file L6-Exercises.ipynb
   where we show how to use Boolean operations and
   arrive at more complex DFA. This design will
   be discussed in Lecture 6 of the 2019 CS 3100
   at the University of Utah, School of Computing.
