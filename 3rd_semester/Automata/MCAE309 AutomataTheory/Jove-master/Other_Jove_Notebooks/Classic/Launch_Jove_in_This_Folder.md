    Which folder to be in before typing "Jupyter notebook"?

Directory navigation from a browser appears to be much easier
if you typed "Jupyter notebook" while in this directory (which
is the top-level directory you are in after git clone, i.e. Jove).

That way you can easily navigate up/down the directory hierarchy
quite conveniently. If you launched Jove within another directory,
you may not find the right directory paths to click.

OK, after installing the things described in 
Jupyter_Notebook_Installation.pdf, you may begin your
first experience with Jove beginning with the notebooks within
First\_Jove\_Tutorial.
