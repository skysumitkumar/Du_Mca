We want the code to resemble math written at this level. Hence the notion of bringing in another layer (namely objects) is felt un-necessary.\n",

Thus, even math _may_ need structured programming principles at a certain higher level of complexity.  We feel that this subject matter hasn't reached that level of complexity, and hence \"math dictates modularization\", not code.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Put the states into two equivalence classes (EC):\n",
    "\n",
    " a. All non-final states are in one EC, say NF\n",

    " c. We call any (sa,sb) such that sa in NF and sb in F as **zero-distinguishable** states, as \n",
    "    a $\\varepsilon$ string can distinguish sa and sb (meaning, when sa is evolved through $\\varepsilon$ or $sb$ is evolved through $\\varepsilon$, the resulting state is the same -- sa or sb)\n",
    "    \n",
    "     * \"Evolved through\" means $\\hat{\\delta}(sa,\\varepsilon) = sa$, and similarly for sb\n",
    "     \n",
    "     * In our example DFA d34bl, IF is zero-distinguishable from all other states\n",
    " \n",
    "2. In general, we have $k$-distinguishable states for $k>0$ (above step discussed $k=0$ as zero-distinguishability)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Split states:\n",
    " \n",
    " a. Take a state pair $(s_1,s_2)$ such that they are not $k$ distinguishable.\n",
    " b. Take $c\\in\\Sigma$\n",
    " c. If $\\delta(s_1,c) = sn_1$ and $\\delta(s_2,c) = sn_2$ and $(sn_1,sn_2)$ are $k$-distinguishable, mark $(s_1,s_2)$ as $k+1$-distinguishable. \n",
    " \n",
    "4. Repeat the above process till across one sweep, the distinguishability relation does not change.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Take all maximal sets of pairs of states that have not been found distinguishable yet. Pick a representative from each such maximal set. These states are in the final DFA. \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Go by the state transitions of the representative states. (The remaining states in the equivalence classes are not necessary.)\n",
    "\n",
    "  * In our example, all pairs in $\\{A,A1\\} \\times \\{B,B1\\}$ will be 1-distinguishable (distinction made by $0$)\n",
