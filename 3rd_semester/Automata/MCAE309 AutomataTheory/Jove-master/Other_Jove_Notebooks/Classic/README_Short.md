# What is Jove?

 Jove is the collection of Jupyter notes created by Firstname Lastname
 for teaching Models of Computation. We use "Jove", "Jove note books" and
 "Jupyter notebooks" interchangeably. However "Jove" denotes those Jupyter 
 notebooks that are part of the git distribution, tying together many learning
 modules.

The Github URL for this README.md is https://github.com/anon-Jove/Jove.git

 _PLEASE NOTE THAT Jove REQUIRES PYTHON 3_

# Brand new feature in Jove - ANIMATIONS !!

 Try out notebooks/driver/Drive_Animations.ipynb as your first notebook. It has
 extensive documentation on the use of the animations feature. This entire subsystem
 was implemented by Paul C.J. Carlson, Undergraduate Researcher in my group, whose
 Linked-in page is https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-cj-carlson.

 Details also in bit.ly/JoveAnimations

 The animation subsystem also includes a future addition
 being implemented ... which will allow JFLAP files to be imported into Jove.
 
# Tasks and Order Recommended

1) Install Jupyter notebooks following the instructions in
Jupyter\_Notebook\_Installation.pdf found in this directory.
Then git clone Jove from 
[https://github.com/anon-Jove/Jove.git](https://github.com/firstnameutah/Jove.git).

   Now you are ready to follow the contents First\_Jove\_Tutorial 
   and get a feel for Jupyter
   notes, Jove, and my book.
   
   2) Read the book Automata and Computability: A Programmer's Perspective
   (hereafter often abbreviated as _ACPP_).
   Don't worry if you don't have access to the book, although the book provides
    the theory and ties-in Jove's usage.

3) If you have bought the ACPP book, look at its Appendix B to know which
 Jove functions are in which Jove (Jupyter) notebooks
