This is a basic tutorial of NFA and the Jove commands associated
with NFA. Please play with CH7.ipynb and learn all about NFA.

There is a nice Youtube video insde CH7.ipynb. It can also
be played directly from [this link](https://youtu.be/xjFtLF95uBc).

Be sure to look up the book's Appendix-B to see
what commands pertain to DFA operations (it lists
Jove commands going chapterwise)
