This directory contains simple examples of all the capabilities included in Jove.

** Start from the new Animations Feature from Start_with_These_Animations.ipynb **

Once you practice these (or revisit here to practice these), you will be able
to launch into more involved examples included in notebooks/ .

Whether you have my book or not, you may kindly go in the chapter order of the directories.

Try ACMDSP that has my ACM Distinguished Speaker Program material. It shows many advanced examples.
Just run and watch.

My ACM Distinguished Speaker material is here: https://speakers.acm.org/speakers/lastname_11429

Try these there:

* Calculator_with_Parse_Tree_Drawing.ipynb

* Drive_ACMDSP.ipynb

* Any other ipynb files you wish!
