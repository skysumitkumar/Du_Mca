UserFacet Interview Experience

There were 4 Rounds (OA + Technical Interview + Interview with CEO + Interview with CTO)

1: OA : In the online assessment we were given a problem statement based on the role we had chosen and we were supposed to submit the solution within the limited time frame. 

2: Technical Interview : In the technical Interview we were asked technical questions based on our role. I chosen front end so questions were related to HTML, CSS and React. It was not an easy interview as the interviewer asked me some of the recently introduced CSS properties. Some i was able to answer but for others tried reaching the closest. The code i submitted in OA was reviewed and questions were asked for the same.

3: CEO :  This was not a kind of technical interview, instead it was a behavioural questioning round in which the interviewer questioned about my family background, strong points, weak points, my aims etc. It was quiet a nice interview

4: CTO : This was also a behavioural round but with a few simple technical questions. In start the CTO asked me to introduce myself follwed by my family background and then he asked me some simple questions about Front End which was winded up within 22 minutes 

Time Limits : 
OA : 2 Hours
Technical Round : 45 minutes
CEO : 30 minutes
CTO : 30 minutes

Overall it was a nice interview experience with Userfacet
