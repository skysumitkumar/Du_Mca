Last week, Gazette Reader Cospul warned me of a problem he had with a browser enhancement, called MyWebSearch:<I> <P>&quot; I downloaded and installed [the browser plug-in] only to find out that it hijacked my Internet Explorer ... Whatever [web site I visit, MyWebSearch either displays their site or an error message].</p> <P>... I emailed the Mywebsearch [support many times], but they have not [provided any useful technical advice]. I even hired a certified Microsoft technician to fix the problem -- but after a week, all they could tell me was that Mywebsearch acts like a virus (no kidding!). I can't [seem to] find any capable technical help! Please warn your subscribers before it is too late! &quot;</p> </I> <P>After publishing the article, I received over 65 emails within the last few days with many great helpful comments and suggestions from Readers. Gazette Reader Stephen E. and many others were so beaten by MyWebSearch, that they reinstalled Windows just to get rid of it.</p> <I> <P>&quot; I'm sorry to say that the only way I've found to safely remove MyWebSearch from the computer is by doing a <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.infopackets.com/articles/reinstallwindows.htm  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.infopackets.com/articles/reinstallwindows.htm'" tppabs="http://www.infopackets.com/articles/reinstallwindows.htm"> clean install of windows</a>. I know that this is extreme but the program lodges itself so deeply in the system [and like Cospul mentioned], it's virtually impossible to clean it off. I hope that this helps those that have been stumped. PS: Keep up the good work with infopackets: I look forward to it all the time.&quot;</p> </I> <P>
<b>If you recall, we discovered that MyWebSearch contains something called a Browser Helper Object</b>.</P> <P> To recap, a &quot;Browser Helper Object is a [.DLL file] that allows developers to customize and control Internet Explorer (IE).

It lets you disable any BHO programs installed and also tells you where the offending file is at, and usually what company the BHO object came from. I have also used it to remove Mywebsearch Bar, and several other Nasty toolbars that [some how or another ended up on my machine].</p> <P>The only toolbar that I use is the Google Bar that you can download from the Google homepage: it lets you choose to send info to google or not when you install, and it also stops popups and there are several other features that are really good.

But, as Nancy points out, it is a bit of an advanced program. She writes:</p> <I> <P>&quot; [This is sort of off topic, but I was recently infected with the] 'CoolWebSearch' Spyware/BHO. It came onto my system after I downloaded a WallPaper file for my Desktop. I spent 3+ days searching and gathering information [on how to remove this program].

Reboot your computer into Safe Mode, and delete the BHO's .DLL files from the system. Next, search the registry for the name MyWebSearch and delete every entry. Finally: search the hard drive for the program, delete it, and reboot.</p> <P>By the way, Browser HiJack Blaster (free) is a great anti-BHO program which runs silently in the background ... it only springs into action when an attempt [to inject a BHO] is made.

confuse most computer users (let alone, newbies). And with a plethora of CD 
formats, creating a CD -- whether it's an audio CD for your car, or a data CD 
for your computer -- can certainly prove to be a difficult task. Thankfully,

use it)!</p>
