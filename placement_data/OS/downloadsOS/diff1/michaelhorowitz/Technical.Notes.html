 <p><b>Programming Notes:&nbsp;</b></p>
      <p>TimeKeeper is coded in JavaScript. I attempted to avoid all new
      features in the language so that TimeKeeper could be used with more web
      browsers. Specifically, features in JavaScript 1.3 were avoided. All the
      scripts are in the one TimeKeeper page and can be easily viewed with any
      HTML or text editor.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The functions that respond to the main, driver buttons, only do
      processing. That is, they do sanity checks, calculations and set the
      cookies. They do no generation of visible output. The dynamic creation of
      HTML is all done by scripts in the body of the web page. These scripts
      only read the cookies, never change them.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The functions that work on the current project (Start, End, Suspend,
      Resume, Reset) all deal with global variables. These function never
      directly interact with the cookies. Likewise, when the web page is being
      dynamically built by scripts in the BODY section, these scripts too read
      the globally shared variables. They never update these variables and never
      deal with the cookies directly. The global variables have names that start
      with &quot;global_&quot;. The are initialized to &quot;*not found*&quot;
      and are then populated based on the input cookies. Variables that have no
      value in the input cookies remain with the &quot;*not found*&quot; value.
      The global variables are set in the ReadCookieSetupVariables()
      function.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>There is a debug mode for TimeKeeper in which it dumps out the cookies.
      To enable debug mode, edit the web page. Near the top is a variable called
      &quot;DebugMode&quot; that is normally initialized to &quot;off&quot;. Set
      it to &quot;on&quot;.&nbsp;It also displays the time the page was loaded.
      This should only be of interest to me.&nbsp;</p>

      <p><b>Timers:</b><br>
	   TimeKeeper is not running anything while its web page is displayed. It als does not auto-reload itself.
	   No timers are used (except in the reminder windows).<br>
       The cookies created here all expire Dec 3, 2008 for now. This will be upgraded soon to a fixed time
       from now. </p>

      <p><b>Netscape Navigator v4&nbsp;</b></p>
	        <p>With v4.77 the page title does not change in response to the below. It
	        works in IE5.&nbsp;<br>
	        &nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="Courier New" size="2"> document.title = &quot;new
	        title here&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>
	        <p>With v4.77 TimeKeeper loads very slowly, much more slowly than with  IE5.</p>
	        <p>Due to differences in the way Navigator and IE5 handle&nbsp;<br>
	        &nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Courier New" size="2">&lt;a HREF  onclick="document.bgColor='aqua'; return true"></font><br>
      I suppress the option to change the background color when the browser is not IE</p>
      <p>Navigator 4.77 also caused lots of grief with the reminders feature and
      with disabling buttons (see below).</p>

      <p><b>Reminders&nbsp;</b></p>

      <p>The alert
        window created when a reminder time is reached, is created using the JavaScript <font face="Courier New" size="2">alert</font>
      command. In testing, I found this window caused a beep on a Windows 2000
      computer and not on a Windows NT4 computer. I emailed <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.dannyg.com/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.dannyg.com/'" tppabs="http://www.dannyg.com/">Danny
      Goodman</a>, the author of the JavaScript Bible to ask if the alert
      command causes a beep or not. He was nice enough to respond and said that
      the beep is Operating System dependent. He said there will be no beep on
      an Apple Macintosh. The JavaScript language does not, unfortunately, have
      any sort of beep command.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Originally reminders were going to be hosted in the main TimeKeeper
      page but it turns out they get destroyed when a page is reloaded. So it
      goes. Instead, each reminder is spawned as its own web browser window.
      These reminder windows are independent of the TimeKeeper window.&nbsp; The
      timer is started by the new window, not by the main TimeKeeper window.
      After the timer alert is issued, the new window closes itself.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Reminders are implemented very differently from the main TimeKeeper
      window. TimeKeeper sets no timers and stores all data in cookies. The
      reminder windows set/read no cookies and they are driven by a timer that
      it set when the page is first loaded/created.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Reminders work fine with IE5 but do not work well with Navigator 4.77 (I
      haven't tested other browsers). IE5 will spawn multiple reminder windows
      as long as the window name property of the window.open command is null (it
      is). Navigator 4.77 never spawns multiple reminder windows both when the
      window name was null and when it was set to a value. Each time you set a new reminder in Navigator
      it destroys the old reminder. </p>
      <p>Navigator also has a bug with the onUnload event defined in the BODY
      tag. With a simple web page it works fine, but for some reason when
      TimeKeeper generates a reminder web page with document.write that has the
      onUnload event, it does not work. You can see my Netscape Communicator
      gripes for the gory details. In brief, the onUnload event runs when the page is loaded.
      To work around this problem, I don't generate
      the onUnload event when running under a browser other than IE. This
      means that users with other browsers don't get warned when a reminder is terminated
      prematurely. Reminder windows generated in a browser other than IE include a suggestion to use IE.</p>

      <p><b>Disabling Buttons:</b></p>
      <p>The disabling of buttons proved to be a sinkhole of browser incompatibility.
      In IE buttons are disabled that are not appropriate (such as suspending
      just after suspending). This does not work however in Netscape Navigator
      v4.&nbsp; The HTML and JavaScript code to implement this looks like:&nbsp;</p>

      <p>&nbsp; <font face="Courier New" size="2">&lt;input type=button value="Start Work Day"
      onClick=&quot;StartTicker()&quot; id=&quot;startbutton&quot;&gt;</font><font face="Courier New" size="2"><br>
      &nbsp;i</font><font face="Courier New" size="2">f (global_LastFunction == "Suspn")               {<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; document.Form1.startbutton.disabled    = true;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; document.Form1.suspendbutton.disabled  = true;}</font></p>

      <p>This code says that if you just hit the Suspend button, the start
      button and the suspend button should be disabled. The TimeKeeper logic is
      that you can't suspend working while you are already suspended and you
      can't start a new work day while the current day is suspended (instead,
      you have to end the current day first).&nbsp;</p>

      <p>This code works fine in IE5 but Netscape seemed not to not execute it
      at all. Debugging showed that when none of the if tests were true,
      Navigator executed the entire script. However, when an if test was true,
      the browser died right there and failed to execute the rest of the script.
      I tried changing the identifying string of the buttons from &quot;id&quot;
      to &quot;name&quot;. This improved things in that Navigator did not die
      mid-script. However, it did not disable the buttons. Further research
      turned up the fact that disabling of buttons is not supported in Navigator
      v4. It works in IE4, IE5 and Navigator v6.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>While on the subject, Navigator v4 also does not allow control over the
      button label. IE4, IE5 and Navigator v6 do. Users of those browsers will
      see bold labels and a red label on the Help button.&nbsp;</p>

      <p><b>Cookie Fields:</b></p>
      <p>
      <font face="Courier New" size="2">CurrDayTotal </font> is current days total minutes worked<br>
      <font face="Courier New" size="2">
      YestDayTotal</font> is in minutes<br>
      <font face="Courier New" size="2">
      CItimeStarted</font> is the time the current interval started. This could either
      be because the Day just started or because a new interval was started
      after a suspend. It is always two digits, a colon and two more digits.<br>
      <font face="Courier New" size="2">
      CIdatestarted</font> looks wrong because the month is a JavaScript month which
      ranges from zero thru eleven, not from one thru twelve.&nbsp;<br>
      <font face="Courier New" size="2">SuspendDateTime</font> is the date/time
      of the last work suspension. The format derives from the toLocaleString()
      function.&nbsp;<br>
      <font face="Courier New" size="2">
      DayStartDateTime</font> is really just a comment. Its the date/time that the
      current work day started. Its set when the work day starts and is never
      changed (except of course when a new day starts). It is read from the
      cookie and displayed in the main status box.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>One annoying thing about dealing with cookies in client-side JavaScript is
      that you read all the cookies in one big clump, but you write them out one
      at a time.&nbsp;TimeKeeper used to have a cookie for each project related
      variable. Now it has one cookie that represents all 8 variables needed to maintain
      the state of a given project. When client-side JavaScript reads
      cookies, it read them all. Even those not related to TimeKeeper at all. I
      have to parse through this long string that I refer to as BigCookie. A
      colon is used by JavaScript to separate cookies when they are read.
      However, its up to my program to parse through BigCookie and split out
      individual cookies. The last cookie does not end with a semicolon.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Within a project related cookie, I use the up-and-down-line character
      (&quot;|&quot;) as a field separator. The format is<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="2">&nbsp; <font face="Courier New">project1=|fieldname1|value1|fieldname2|value2|&nbsp;</font></font></p>
      <p><b>Other:</b></p>
      <p>If the web browser does not support JavaScript, the user is told that
      JavaScript is required. This is done with NOSCRIPT tags. Note that
      browsers that <i>can</i> support JavaScript may have it disabled. This
      same technique is used both in TimeKeeper itself and on <a href="index-1.htm" tppabs="http://www.michaelhorowitz.com/Timekeeper/index.htm">the
      TimeKeeper home page</a>.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>TimeKeeper does not write to any files or databases. All its data is
      kept in web browser cookies.&nbsp;
      <p>The TimeKeeper logo is clip art included with Front Page 2000.&nbsp;
      <p>The background color is changed using the following<br><font face="Courier New" size="2">
      &nbsp; &lt;td width="40" bgcolor="yellow">&lt;a HREF onclick=&quot;document.bgColor='yellow'; return true"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &lt;font color="yellow">xxxx&lt;/font>&lt;/a>&lt;/td></font><br>
      The null HREF results in no link being visible to the user, the mouse
      pointer does not change. The x's are hidden because they are the same
      color as the table cell background. There has to be something there for
      the HREF to hang on to. I've seen this done as a transparent GIF but that
      limits the size. I've also seen it done with a letter X but that is
      visible to the user.&nbsp;I've also seen this done with onmouseover as
      opposed to onclick. However, I think its too easy to change the color by
      accident when using the mouseover event.&nbsp;
      <p>A cookie, by default, only applies to the directory it is in. This single TimeKeeper.html file can be used<br>
      to track multiple projects by putting different copies of it in multiple directories. If each project<br>
      has its own directory, this works out great. The lowermost directory name is displayed as the project<br>
      name in the page heading. For example&nbsp;<br>
  C:\my documents\projectabc               it displays "projectabc"&nbsp;<br>
  C:\customer2\current\JonesReport         it displays "JonesReport"&nbsp;<br>
  C:\workstuff\BIGclient\JunePresentation  it displays &quot;JunePresentation&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      <p><b>Questions:</b></p>
      <p>How can you abort a JavaScript script when a fatal error is detected?
      Try/Catch blocks are too new to be widely implemented. The language
      tolerates all sorts of numeric errors, such as dividing by zero. One thing
      you can do is assign a variable to an undefined variable, but that does
      not stop the script cold.&nbsp;
      <p>How do stop execution of a script when there is not error? I have a
      script that is not part of a function and only want to execute it
      sometimes. If it was a function, no problem, you just <font size="2" face="Courier New">return</font>.
      But in the body of a script? For the time being, I put the whole script inside an if test, but
      this is not very elegant. The break statement can break
      out of any labeled statement, but as far as I know, labeling a statement
      requires JavaScript 1.3 and I prefer to rely on older syntax.&nbsp;
      <p>Is there a no-op in JavaScript? Sometimes its preferable to code&nbsp;<br>
      <font face="Courier New" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; if (a==b) </font><i><font size="2" face="Arial Narrow">do
      nothing</font></i><font face="Courier New" size="2"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; else c=34;&nbsp;</font><br>
      In TimeKeeper, I used &quot;no = op&quot; for the <i>do nothing</i></font></td></tr>
