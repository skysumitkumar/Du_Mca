<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>May 7, 2004</b></p>
<p>Minor changes.&nbsp; First time users will now have the
Resume, Suspend and End buttons disabled. No longer restrict the changing of the background color feature to
only IE. Neatened up the UI a bit (the stuff at the bottom is now centered). The Help window now has a white background.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>February&nbsp; 9, 2004&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>Changes to web pages only, to bring them more in line with the design of the
rest of the web site (headers, footers, CSS). Minor cosmetic changes to the
TimeKeeper OnLine page.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>November 7, 2001&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>The four buttons that drive TimeKeeper are now dynamically disabled when
appropriate. For example, when the timer is off (you are not working), the only
active button is the one to start a new work day. Disabling buttons has been tested with IE5.
It should also work with IE4, IE6 and Netscape Navigator v6. It does not work
with Navigator v4. If you click an inappropriate button in Navigator v4 a JavaScript
error window is displayed which is the way TimeKeeper used to work up until
now.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>September 9, 2001</b></p>

<p>Minor stuff: The main status window now says current directory rather than current project.
Upped the max number of minutes allowed in a reminder from 360 to 540. Added
maxlength=99 parameter to input text boxes for comments and reminders. Added
maxlength=3  parameter to input text box for reminder minutes. Bolded keywords in the help window.
Added tests for the success of both window.open commands</p>

<p><b>September 5, 2001&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>Minor tweaks to reminders: The title of the reminder window now has the first
20 characters of the reminder text so that it's visible in the Windows Task Bar.
The reminder windows now say that they can be minimized and warn about loading
another web page into them. Updated the usage notes page.&nbsp;Both the online
and offline versions are now in synch, previously the online version was older
code.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>September 4, 2001</b></p>
<p> Added reminders to the off-line version and a write-up about them to the
online usage notes. Also added a technical discussion of how the reminders are
implemented to the Technical Notes page. Note that reminders work much better
with IE5 than with Netscape Navigator v4.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>September 3, 2001</b></p>

<p>Got rid of the debugging information in the online version of TimeKeeper.
Neatened up the comments section on both the online and offline versions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>September 2, 2001</b></p>

<p>Fixed new user problem in the offline version. The first time a new user
invokes TimeKeeper, there are no TimeKeeper cookies to be found. The cookie
parsing routine, incorrectly issued an alert saying there was an error. The only
error was in issuing the alert.&nbsp;Finished the usage notes page. Made the
debugging information (the display of current cookie values) optional which
cleared up a lot of junk at the bottom of the page (it defaults to being off).
This was only of interest to me and the look of TimeKeeper is much cleaner. See the Technical
Notes page for more on debug mode.</p>

<p><b>September 1, 2001&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>Major re-write to the offline version. In the old days, TimeKeeper used a
separate cookie for each data field. The online version still works this way.
The offline version now has a single cookie with all twelve variables needed to
maintain the current state of a project. User interface changes were minimal.
This change was made in preparation for giving TimeKeeper the ability to handle
multiple projects.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The TimeKeeper cookie is named &quot;TimeKeeperProject&quot;. Any other input
cookies are ignored. In the cookie, all the variables for a project
are mushed together and separated by the &quot;|&quot; character. Up front, the new cookie is read
and parsed into a bunch of globally shared variables. At the end, all the
globally shared variables that have a value are saved back into the single
TimeKeeper cookie. Variables that have no value are always indicated by the string
&quot;*not found*&quot;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The new function getCookieByName returns one cookie. The
old function, getCookieData has been deleted. The new function
ReadCookieSetupVariables is the only function that reads the input cookies. It
sets up the globally shared variables. All processing is
done on these globally shared variables. This too was done in preparation for
handling multiple projects, code that references the globally shared variables
will not need to be changed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The code used to zap the background color when the page is being loaded has
been improved. A count of the cookies has been added to the debugging section
when displaying formatted cookies.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>August 29, 2001&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>Fixed looping problem in the offline version in the routine that reads the
cookies. It caused IE to say that the script was running slowly and offering to
abort it.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>August 2, 2001&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>The page is now re-loaded after the
background color is changed. This was done to write out the cookie with the new
background color.&nbsp;Debugging information was moved to the very bottom of the
web page.</p>

<p><b>August 1, 2001&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>The duration of a work interval is now calculated in one place rather than
two. It's in function CalculateMinsWorked(). Three globally used date/time
fields are now calculated in one place rather than multiple places. They are
consolidated in function SetupDates(). For use in Reset processing, I verified
that subtracting 7 seconds from a date object that is only a couple seconds past
the hour, appropriately reduces the minutes field. Deleted all references to the
deprecated variable TimeStarted.&nbsp;Debugging information now includes a
formatted display of the cookie values in addition to the unformatted display it
always had.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>July 30, 2001&nbsp;
</b></p>

<p>The background color is now saved in a cookie when the user changes it. This
cookie is read back every time the page is loaded and used to dynamically
generate the &lt;BODY&gt; tag with the appropriate background color.&nbsp;Also
fixed links at the bottom of page, some were relative rather than
absolute.&nbsp;Current project is now displayed in the main status box next to
the timer information.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>July 27, 2001&nbsp;
</b></p>

<p>Got rid of the <b>Help on Tech</b> button. Full technology notes and comments
are now on this web site.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>July 26, 2001&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>Added ability for IE users to change the background color. This is only
implemented in the off-line version because the on-line version should keep the
same color scheme as the rest of the web site. It is not implemented for
Netscape Navigator users (see technical notes). It is not yet saved in a cookie,
so the color change is reset on every page load.&nbsp;Modified the help text in
the offline version to link to the online usage notes.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>July 24, 2001&nbsp;<br>
</b>Changed the background color to be consistent with the rest of the gripes
web site. Also started to maintain a version intended for on-line use and
another version intended for off-line use, downloaded by users.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>June 2, 2001<i><br>
</i></b>Dynamically adjust the title bar. Every time the TimeKeeper web page is
loaded, the first word of the title bar is always set to ON or OFF for the
benefit of the task bar. The Windows task bar displays the first few characters
of the window title. With this change, the first few characters are always ON or
OFF, thus making it obvious whether the timer is on or off.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>May 11, 2001&nbsp;</b><br>
Changed background color to light green</p>
<p><b>February 13, 2001</b><br>
When suspend, it no longer puts out a message box with the length of just ended
interval. It was getting annoying.&nbsp;<br>
Display hours and minutes vs. just minutes&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Very old changes</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Added 'Save This' warning at end of day.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Fixed problem with deleting comments, now set to 'none'.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Added a Welcome for new users.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Renamed 'TimeStarted' cookie field to 'CItimeStarted' to better reflect
    its true purpose.</li>
  <li>Save date that a work interval starts both at start of day and when
    resume.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Suspend now calculates length of current work interval using <b><i>date</i></b>
    and time, before it only used time. This means you can work past midnight.</li>
  <li>Fixed problem displaying backslashes</li>
