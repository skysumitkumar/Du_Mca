<p>For a virus to infect your computer, you have to run it. Most often, the
virus attaches itself to an email message and usually (but not always) just
viewing the email message is safe. However, that starts a cat and mouse game
with the virus writer saying anything and everything he/she can think of to
trick you into opening the attached file and thus running the virus and
infecting your computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some examples of the ploys used to get
you to open an attached file. In these cases the messages came from someone
unknown to the recipient, but be aware that the FROM address of an email message
is very easily forged. Don't treat a message with less suspicion because it <i>seems</i>
to have come from someone you know. Also, see the note at the end of this topic;
you may not be seeing the full file name of attached files.</p> </font>

<p>In the message above that says &quot;You are infected. Read the details!&quot;,
the attached file is &quot;<font size="2" face="Courier New">old_photos.rtf.scr&quot;.</font>
You should not open .scr files either, just like .pif
files, Windows will try to execute them. The reason the file name has
&quot;.rtf&quot; in it is to fool people who know not to open files that are
executable. An .RTF file is not executable. There is a very bad default in
Windows Explorer that hides the file extension of files of known types. I think
this was done either to make Windows simpler for new users or to copy the Mac.
It is a very bad way to go and all Windows users should change this option and
force Windows to always show you the full file name. If your copy of Windows is
not showing you full file names, you will see this attached file
as &quot;<font size = "2" face="Courier New">old_phots.rtf</font>&quot;
and feel safe opening it.</p>

<p>Still another trick takes advantage of the fact that many email messages are
scanned by anti-virus programs before they reach your inbox. The virus inserts a forged
message at the bottom that looks like an anti-virus program scanned the email and gave it a
good bill of health. For example:
<div align="center"><center>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">

anti-virus program that deleted a virus in an attachment:

<p>I don't have an example of this, but another common approach to trick
you into opening/running an attached file is for the email message to appear to
come from Microsoft. The message seems to be a warning that you you should update your security software.
In reality, Microsoft never ever sends software via email. In fact, no legitimate organization will ever send you an
executable file attached to an email message. Microsoft won't do it, Symantec won't do it, McAfee won't do it, Apple won't do it, Adobe won't do it, Macromedia won't do it, etc.
etc. etc. These companies may send you a message announcing that a new patch or
new software is available, but they will never send the program or patch as an email attachment. The only way to be sure that a program or patch
comes from the company itself, is to go the company's web site and download it
from there.&nbsp;</p><p>This article (<a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.techweb.com/wire/security/57702905  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.techweb.com/wire/security/57702905'" tppabs="http://www.techweb.com/wire/security/57702905">Worm Steals CNN Headlines To Stay Timely, Fool Users</a>

<p>In general, requests by a company to &quot;reconfirm&quot; or
&quot;verify&quot; personal data is a ruse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Any time you get an email that seems to be from a financial institution you
deal with, don't follow the link in the email. Instead type the company's
address into your web browser manually.&nbsp;</p>



<p> If the email is addressed &quot;Dear SunTrust customer&quot; it
is likely a fraud. A real message from a company you do business with would
address you by your full name. This indicates the sender of the message does not
know your name.&nbsp;Citibank, a very popular victim of phishing scams, now includes your first name, last name and the last 4 digits of your account number at the top of
any email message from them.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Classic Scam<a name="Classic Scam"></a></h3>

<font face="Verdana" size="2">
<p>Ignore messages from someone claiming to be a representative of the Nigerian government, promising a multi-million dollar reward for your help in transferring a huge sum of money.
This scam, known as the "419 Scam&quot; or the &quot;Nigerian scam&quot;, pre-dates the Internet. Victims are asked for their bank account and other personal information. Invariably a "problem" arises and the victim
is pressured or threatened to provide a large sum of money to save the venture.</p>
<p>In another wrinkle, a person claiming to be from a third-world country, again
with custody of a large amount of money, offers to share the wealth with you if you will
help them get it out of the country. The scammer needs your bank account information to deposit the money in your account. If you give it, you
find that money withdrawn from, rather than deposited to, your account.&nbsp;</p>

two examples:&nbsp;</p>

   Subject: urgent assistant<br>
   From: "Michael   James" <jamesmic9@hotmail.com><br>
  Dear Sir/Madam<br><br>
  I know this letter will come as a surprise to you, but i would like you to give it a
  top consideration so as to help me and my family from our present predicament.<br><br>
  I am Michael  James, the first son of Mr Leonard James, a British Farmer based in Zimbabwe. My father
  is now dead as a result of his incarceration by the Zimbabwean Government under President Robert Mugabe
  who ordered the white farmers in Zimbabwe to  vacate their Farm Land and go back to their country.<br><br>
  But my father, due to his large investment in the Farm Land refused to quit Zimbabwe for his country.
  Based on this reason he was arrested and imprisoned and as a result of his protracted sickness [Diabetics]
  he died in Manfe prison on 19 sept 2002. May his gentle soul rest in perfect peace.<br><br>
  After his death, all efforts by my mother who is a Zimbabwean to secure most of my father's investment was
  frustrated by the President Mugabes Government. Towards this end my mother discovered  an original
  certificate of deposit for a trunk box containing the sum of USD9,000,000.00 ( Nine million U.S.Dollars)
  deposited by my late father  in custody of a security trust company in Dubai, UAE. The money belonged to
  the White Farmers Association [W. F. A] which my late father was the Founder/President with the help of
  my maternal uncle who was a Comissioner in Zimbabwe.<br><br>
  We are able to trace the security trust company to Dubai [U.A.E] where the box containing the money is
  presently deposited, declared as Family Jewellries and Antiquities  as to avoid raising any eye brow
  from the authority here. All documented proofs in respect of this deposited consignment are in my pocession.<br><br>
  As it is, I am looking for a reliable partner who can help me safe-guide and invest this money very
  prudently in his company as advised by my mother. 20% of this money will be given to you while 5% will be
  set aside for miscellanous expenses that we may incure during the process.<br><br>
  Also note that this transaction is 100% risk free, you may also be required to come to Dubai if need be on
  indication of your interest. Please confirm your interest on this transaction and contact me on my  email
  address; michaeljames@Z6.com <br><br>
  I am presently in Dubai [U A E]. Hoping to hear from you soonest.<br>
  Thanks and Remain blessed<br>Michael  James </font></td></tr>

<h3><a name="SPAM&nbsp;">SPAM</a>&nbsp;</h3>

<font face="Verdana" size="2">

<p>Needless to say, no one needs examples of SPAM. However, there is an
interesting point about the message below.&nbsp;</p>


<p> It was sent to the webmaster address
of a web site of mine (the name is changed to mikesdomain.org for the purposes
of this example). The message came to an email address
that never subscribes to anything, so it was obviously &quot;harvested&quot;
(the polite word for stolen) from the web site. The &quot;partner website&quot;
claim is not true. The main point though, is about the email removal. No matter what email
address you try to remove, the web site says it was successfully removed. Make
up an email address, and it says its removed. I can't prove it, but I would bet
money that trying to remove your email address, just results in more SPAM as the
address is now confirmed to be good.&nbsp;The Remove Me button referred to in
the message takes you to <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.seekercenter.net/remove.php?email=webmaster@mikesdomain.org  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.seekercenter.net/remove.php?email=webmaster@mikesdomain.org'" tppabs="http://www.seekercenter.net/remove.php?email=webmaster@mikesdomain.org">www.seekercenter.net/remove.php?email=webmaster@mikesdomain.org</a>&nbsp;</p>


<p> The lesson: don't bother un-subscribing to SPAM. It will either be a waste
of time or an invitation to get more SPAM.&nbsp;</p>

<p> Also, please, never ever buy anything advertised via SPAM, even if it's
something you want. This just encourages more SPAM on all of us.&nbsp;Also,
never click on a link in a SPAM email message as this is likely to result in
your receiving even more SPAM.&nbsp;</p>


<p>One tactic spammers often use to avoid anti-spam software is to change the
spelling of words that the software might think indicates a message is SPAM. The
most famous such word is Viagra. A humorous take on the many ways Viagra is
purposely mis-spelled can be read in <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://cockeyed.com/lessons/viagra/viagra.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://cockeyed.com/lessons/viagra/viagra.html'" tppabs="http://cockeyed.com/lessons/viagra/viagra.html">There are 600,426,974,379,824,381,952 ways to spell Viagra</a>.
On a serious note, mis-spellings also used, as mentioned above, to disguise the
real address of a web site for fraudulent purposes.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Garbage words</b>: Another tactic you may see in SPAM messages is the inclusion
of many garbage words or garbage sentences. This is done to get around assorted SPAM filters.
Below
is an example of this where the garbage words are at the bottom. SPAM
filters based on Bayesian interference decide whether a message is SPAM or not based on words that often
appear in SPAM messages. The tactic here is to include words that normally do
not appear in SPAM messages in order to get a message classified as not being
SPAM. I have seen this described as &quot;word salad&quot; or &quot;dictionary salad&quot;.
In HTML based messages, the garbage words may be hidden by either making them
the same color as the background or by making the text extremely small. If you
view your messages in plain text, the garbage words will always be
visible.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bayesian SPAM filters have gotten so good that the bad guys have yet another
new tactic, no words. An HTML based email message contains nothing but a link to
a picture. The advertising message is wholly contained in the picture.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Why is there so much SPAM and Phishing? It's profitable and easy. Here is one
example of the easy part. This is an actual email message that I received in
April 2004.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="Bounced Emails&nbsp;">Bounced Emails&nbsp;</a></h3>

<font face="Verdana" size="2">
Should you send an email message to an address that does not exist, it is likely
that the email server at the recipients domain will respond to you with an email
message informing you of the problem. Your message is said to have
&quot;bounced&quot;. Below are excerpts from legitimate bounce messages. The reason this is here is
because there are two types of bad bounce messages.
<ul>
  <li>Ones actually generated by an email server, but for an email message that you did
    not send. Delete the message and forget about it. Many viruses proliferate
    by emailing themselves with fraudulent FROM addresses. If you are the victim
    of this, there is nothing you can do.
    You may also get a real message from a real email server complaining that you sent an email message
    with a virus in it. Most likely you did not. Instead the virus sent out many copies of itself
    from someone else's computer using a
    forged FROM address and you are as much a victim as the recipient. For more
    see <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,110918,00.asp  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,110918,00.asp'" tppabs="http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,110918,00.asp">Could You Be Sending Spam?</a>
    Spammers are using new tools to hide the origin of their messages. by Lincoln
    Spector in PC World magazine. May 30, 2003&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>More serious is when a virus or worm sends a message that appears to be a normal bounce
    message but is fraudulent. In this case, there will be an attached file and
    a phony story in the body of the message that tries to trick you into
    opening the attached file. Don't! Delete the message.&nbsp;</li>
