<p><b>Flavors:</b>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">(revised Jan.2004) )Both Windows and Linux come in
many flavors. All the flavors of Windows
come from Microsoft, the various distributions of Linux come from different
companies (i.e.<a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.lindows.com/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.lindows.com/'" tppabs="http://www.lindows.com/">Lindows</a>, Lycoris,

<a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.mandrakesoft.com/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.mandrakesoft.com/'" tppabs="http://www.mandrakesoft.com/">Mandrake</a>, <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.knoppix.net/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.knoppix.net/'" tppabs="http://www.knoppix.net/">Knoppix</a>,
Slackware). Windows has two main lines: &quot;Win9x&quot;, which consists of
Windows 95, 98, 98SE and Me, and &quot;NT class&quot; which consists of Windows
NT, 2000 and XP. Windows actually started, in the old days, with version 3.x
which pre-dated Windows 95 by a few years.</p>
<p>The flavors of Linux are referred to
as distributions (often shortened to &quot;distros&quot;). All the Linux distributions released around the same time frame will
use the same kernel (the guts of the Operating System). They differ in the
add-on software provided, GUI, install process, price, documentation and
technical support. Both Linux and Windows come in desktop and server
editions.</p>
<p>There may be too many distributions of Linux,
it's possible that this is hurting Linux in the marketplace. I suspect that the
lack of a Linux distro from a major computer company is also hurting it in the
marketplace. Perhaps this will change with Novell's <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.suse.com/us/company/press/press_releases/archive03/novell_suse.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.suse.com/us/company/press/press_releases/archive03/novell_suse.html'" tppabs="http://www.suse.com/us/company/press/press_releases/archive03/novell_suse.html">purchase</a>
of SuSE.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Linux is customizable in a way that Windows is
not. There are many special purpose versions of Linux above and beyond the full
blown distributions described above. For example, <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.serverelements.com/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.serverelements.com/'" tppabs="http://www.serverelements.com/">NASLite</a>
is a version of Linux that runs off a single floppy disk and converts an old
computer into a file server. This ultra small edition of Linux is capable of
networking, file sharing and being a web server.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><b>Graphical User Interface: </b><font face="Verdana" size="2">(updated June
20, 2005) Both Linux and Windows
provide a GUI and a command line interface. The Windows GUI has changed from
Windows 3.1 to Windows 95 (drastically) to Windows 2000 (slightly) to Windows XP
(fairly large) and is slated to change again with the next version of Windows,
the one that will replace XP. Windows XP has a themes feature that offers some
customization of the look and feel of the GUI.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Linux typically provides two GUIs, KDE and Gnome.&nbsp;</font><font face="Verdana" size="2">See a screen shot of <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://i.walmart.com/i/p/00/66/04/48/10/0066044810417_AV_500X500.jpg  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://i.walmart.com/i/p/00/66/04/48/10/0066044810417_AV_500X500.jpg'" tppabs="http://i.walmart.com/i/p/00/66/04/48/10/0066044810417_AV_500X500.jpg">Lycoris</a>

The <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.lynucs.org/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.lynucs.org/'" tppabs="http://www.lynucs.org/">lynucs.org</a> web site has

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Mark Minasi makes the point (<a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.windowsitpro.com/Articles/Print.cfm?ArticleID=8143  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.windowsitpro.com/Articles/Print.cfm?ArticleID=8143'" tppabs="http://www.windowsitpro.com/Articles/Print.cfm?ArticleID=8143">Windows
and .NET magazine, March 2000</a>) that the Linux GUI is optional while the
Windows GUI is an integral component of the OS. He says that speed, efficiency
and reliability are all increased by running a server instance of Linux without
a GUI, something that server versions of Windows can not do. In the same article
he points out that the detached nature of the Linux GUI makes remote control and
remote administration of a Linux computer simpler and more natural than a
Windows computer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Is the flexibility of the Linux GUI a good
thing? Yes and No. While advanced users can customize things to their liking, it
makes things harder on new users for whom every Linux computer they encounter
may look and act differently.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><b>Text Mode Interface:</b><font face="Verdana" size="2"> This is also known
as a command interpreter. Windows users sometimes call it a DOS prompt. Linux
users refer to it as a shell. Each version of Windows has a single command
interpreter, but the different flavors of Windows have different interpreters.
In general, the command interpreters in the Windows 9x series are very similar
to each other and the NT class versions of Windows (NT, 2000, XP) also have
similar command interpreters. There are however differences between a Windows 9x
command interpreter and one in an NT class flavor of Windows. Linux, like all
versions of Unix, supports multiple command interpreters, but it usually uses
one called BASH (Bourne Again Shell). Others are the Korn shell, the Bourne
shell, ash and the C shell (pun, no doubt, intended).&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><b>Cost: </b><font face="Verdana" size="2">For desktop or home use, Linux is very cheap or free,
Windows is expensive. For server use, Linux is very cheap compared to Windows.
Microsoft allows a single copy of Windows to be used on only one computer.
Starting with Windows XP, they use software to enforce this rule (activation). In contrast,
once you have purchased Linux, you can run it on any number of computers for no
additional charge.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"> As of January 2005, the upgrade edition of Windows XP Home Edition
sells for about $100, XP Professional is about $200. The &quot;full&quot;
version of XP Home is about $200, the full version of XP Professional is $300. Windows Server 2003 Standard Edition with
10 Client licenses is about $1,100. Because they save $100 or so on the cost of Windows, Wal-Mart can sell
a
Linux based computer for $200 (without a monitor) whereas their cheapest Windows XP
computer is $300 (as of January 2005).&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"> The irony here is that Microsoft rose to
dominance in large part by undercutting the competition on cost. Now Linux is
poised to do the same thing.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"> You can buy a Linux book and get the operating
system included with the book for free. You can also download Linux for free
from each of the Linux vendors (assuming your Internet connection is fast enough
for a 600 MB file and you have a CD burner) or from <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.linuxiso.org/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.linuxiso.org/'" tppabs="http://www.linuxiso.org/">www.linuxiso.org</a>.
Both these options however, come without technical support.&nbsp;

</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"> You can purchase
assorted distributions of Linux in a box with a CD and manuals and technical
support for around $40 to $80 (some distributions may be less, others may be
more). Regular updates and ongoing support range from $35 a year for a desktop version of Linux to $1,500 for a high-end server version.

</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"> In August
2004 Red Hat started selling a desktop oriented version of Linux for under $6
per user per year.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"> After the initial cost (or lack thereof) of
obtaining software, there is the ongoing cost of its care and feeding. In October 2002, ComputerWorld magazine quoted the chief technology architect at
 Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. in New York as

that &quot;the cost of running Linux is typically a tenth of the cost of Unix and Microsoft alternatives.&quot;
The head technician at oil company Amerada Hess manages 400 Linux servers by
himself. He was quoted as <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/03_09/b3822610_tc102.htm  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/03_09/b3822610_tc102.htm'" tppabs="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/03_09/b3822610_tc102.htm">saying</a>
&quot;It takes fewer people to manage the Linux machines than Windows
machines.&quot;&nbsp;Microsoft commissioned a study that (no
surprise) found it cheaper to maintain Windows than Linux. However, one of the
authors of the study accused Microsoft of <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/03_09/b3822610_tc102.htm  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/03_09/b3822610_tc102.htm'" tppabs="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/03_09/b3822610_tc102.htm">stacking
the deck</a> by selecting scenarios that are more expensive to maintain on
Linux.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I don't know if there will ever be an objective
measure of the ongoing care and feeding costs for Linux vs. Windows. If there
were however, it would have to consider:&nbsp;</font></p>

<ul>

<p><b>Getting the Operating System: </b><font face="Verdana" size="2">(last
updated August 2004) It is hard to buy a
new computer with Linux pre-installed. The major PC vendors sell only Windows
based computers for home use (the Linux based machines they sell are
servers). In August 2004 HP said it would be an exception to this rule and will
soon offer a business notebook computer, the Compaq nx5000, with SUSE Linux pre-installed.

computers</a> without an OS.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">And what about installing Windows and Linux? Installing Windows from scratch is much easier than installing
Linux from scratch, in my opinion. If nothing else, installing Windows is always the
same whereas the
different distributions of Linux have their own installation programs (these may
even change with different versions of the same distribution).&nbsp;You can't
read an article on this however, without it saying how installing Linux is
getting easier all the time.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Installing Linux on a computer without an OS is
<i>much easier</i> than installing it on a machine with an existing OS that you
want to preserve. The later should only be attempted by experts, it is all too
easy to lose the pre-existing OS and setting up a dual-boot environment is
tricky. In his Linux book, Mark Minasi said that installing Linux on a desktop computer
was more likely to be successful than on a laptop computer.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Part of the difficulty in installing Linux is
terminology and documentation. The install process is designed by Linux people
for Linux people. A Windows-only person is likely to encounter terminology and
concepts they are unfamiliar with. With Red Hat Linux 8, the booklet on how to
install the OS is over a hundred pages.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><b>Running from CD:</b> <font face="Verdana" size="2">One
thing that Linux can do that Windows can not, is run from a CD. To run Windows,
it has to first be installed to your hard disk. That said, if Windows is broken to the point that it can't
start up, there is a free program called <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.nu2.nu/pebuilder/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.nu2.nu/pebuilder/'" tppabs="http://www.nu2.nu/pebuilder/">Bart's Preinstalled Environment</a>
(BartPE) that can run a few Windows programs from a bootable CD. However, this
is not from Microsoft and it can only run a handful of programs that have been set
up ahead of time for use with BartPE. BartPE fills an important need, but creating the CD is not trivial and it only
works with Windows XP and 2003.&nbsp;The main point stands, in and of itself,
Windows can not run from a CD, only from a hard disk.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p>  <font face="Verdana" size="2">Normally Linux also runs from a hard disk, but there are quite a few versions of Linux that run
<i> completely</i> from a CD
without having to be installed to a hard disk (the term for this is a
&quot;Live&quot; CD). This is a great way for Windows
users to experience Linux for the first time. Among the Linux distros that have
a CD-only version are <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.knoppix.net/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.knoppix.net/'" tppabs="http://www.knoppix.net/">Knoppix</a>, SuSE

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The CD based versions of Linux differ in their
use of the hard disk. Some, such as Lindows, do not write anything at all to
your hard disk, making it the safest and easiest way to experience Linux. The
downside of this is speed (CDs are much slower than hard disks) and continuity
(being able to save data between uses). Other versions, such as SuSE, do use
your hard disk (SuSE creates over 200 MB worth of files). What you give up in
safety, you gain in speed. For reviews of Linux distributions that run from a CD

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In addition to kicking the tires, a CD based
version of Linux can also be used to insure your hardware is supported by Linux
and possibly to recover files. If Windows is not able to boot up and there are
files you need on your computer, booting Linux from a CD may offer the
opportunity to copy files off the computer. This is problematic however with the
NTFS file system. I found that the CD based versions of Lindows and SuSE could
not read files stored in an NTFS partition. Perhaps others can.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><b>Application software:&nbsp;</b><font face="Verdana" size="2">There is more
application software
available for Windows.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><b>Obtaining application software: </b><font face="Verdana" size="2">If you
buy a copy of Windows on a CD-ROM, you get no application software with it. If
you buy a copy of Linux on a CD-ROM (or two or three) it typically comes with
gobs of free application software. A new computer with Windows pre-installed may
have additional application software, this is up to the PC vendor. I have seen a
new Sharp laptop machine that came with no software other than Windows itself. In contrast,
Sony VAIOs, for example, come with a lot of software. Often however, necessary software, such
as the Adobe Acrobat reader, is not pre-installed by the PC vendor. Each Linux
distribution comes in multiple flavors, the more expensive versions come with
more application software.</font></p>
<p><b>Application software installation:&nbsp;</b><font face="Verdana" size="2">
The installation of applications under Windows, while not standardized, is
generally consistent. Installing software under Linux varies with each
distribution and is not nearly as simple, easy or obvious as Windows. Lindows lets users install software in a manner
somewhat like Windows update - applications are downloaded and automatically
installed. They charge for this service however.&nbsp;The <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.langa.com/newsletters/2004/2004-05-20.htm  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.langa.com/newsletters/2004/2004-05-20.htm'" tppabs="http://www.langa.com/newsletters/2004/2004-05-20.htm">May

Rob Pegoraro called application software installation <i>&quot;Linux's biggest
embarrassment&quot;</i></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"> and I have no doubt
that he is correct.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><b>Viruses and Spyware:</b> <font face="Verdana" size="2">(Updated March
2005) There are many types of malicious software programs. The most common types
are referred to as Viruses and Spyware. Spyware has become a generic term, much
like &quot;Xerox machine&quot; (which is taken to mean any copying machine, not
just those made by the Xerox corporation). The term &quot;Spyware&quot; now
refers to a whole host of malicious software such as worms, Trojans, dialers,
keystroke loggers, browser hijackers and, of course, actual Spyware. The vast
majority of all malicious software (of all types) runs on Windows. I don't know
the actual percentages, but it wouldn't surprise me if it was 98% or so.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Spyware on Windows has become such a problem
that Microsoft purchased an anti-Spyware software company and released their
product as the Microsoft Anti-Spyware program in early 2005. As this is written
the product is still in beta form, but Microsoft has stated that it will be free
even when complete. In my opinion, Spyware is the worst problem effecting
Windows based computers. In addition to running an anti-virus program
constantly, Windows users also need an anti-Spyware program constantly running
in the background to protect them.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><b>Users and Passwords:</b><font face="Verdana" size="2">  (updated June 2005) You have to log on to Linux
with a userid and password; this is not true of Windows. Typically Windows 9x
did not ask for a userid/password at boot time and, even if it did, it was easily bypassed.
Windows 2000 and XP go both ways. While 2000 almost always required a
userid/password at start-up time, you could assign a default userid/password
pretty easily. A new Windows XP machine used by a home user is likely to not ask
for a userid/password at start-up. However, this depends on the number of users
defined to Windows. When you create a new user in XP the default is not to
require a password for the user. Like Windows 2000, XP can also be set up with a
default userid/password so that it will boot directly to the desktop.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Windows XP, 2000 and Linux all support
different types or classes of users. Windows XP Home Edition supports Administrator class
users that have full and total access to the system and restricted users that,
among other restrictions, can't install software. Windows XP Pro and Windows
2000 support additional levels of users.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Both Linux and Windows can group users into
groups (finally, something well named) and assign privileges to the group rather
than to each individual user. Windows XP and 2000 come with some pre-defined
user groups (such as Power Users), I don't think Linux does (but I'm not sure).
In XP and 2000 user &quot;Administrator&quot; is a member of the Administrators
group.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Linux privileges are basically whether you can
read, modify or execute a file. Files in Linux are always owned by a specific
user and group. Windows has similar file-related privileges but only when using
the NTFS file system. The earlier FAT and FAT32 file systems had no file level
security.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I'm told that Windows NTFS permissions are a
bit more functional than those in Linux, but that Linux distributions are
starting to use extended Access Control Lists as a part of the file system,
bringing them more on par with NTFS. (I won't swear by this)&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Very often Windows users use an Administrator
class userid which gives viruses total access to their system (see <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/WindowsServ/2003/enterprise/proddocs/en-us/Default.asp?url=/resources/documentation/WindowsServ/2003/enterprise/proddocs/en-us/windows_security_whynot_admin.asp  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/WindowsServ/2003/enterprise/proddocs/en-us/Default.asp?url=/resources/documentation/WindowsServ/2003/enterprise/proddocs/en-us/windows_security_whynot_admin.asp'" tppabs="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/WindowsServ/2003/enterprise/proddocs/en-us/Default.asp?url=/resources/documentation/WindowsServ/2003/enterprise/proddocs/en-us/windows_security_whynot_admin.asp">Why you should not run your computer as an administrator</a>
from Microsoft). This obviates the security rules discussed above. In contrast,
Linux users often run as regular non-root users which not only means better
security it also means that, if they
get a virus, the operating system greatly restricts what the virus can do.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"> I
have tried a couple times to set up a Windows XP computer for use by a family,
creating Administrator class userids for the parents and restricted userids for
children. Both cases failed because there were too many programs that did
not function correctly when run by a restricted Windows user (<a href="langa.aug2003.html" tppabs="http://www.michaelhorowitz.com/misc/langa.aug2003.html">more
details here</a>). While Linux has supported the concept of root and restricted
users from the get-go, this is a relatively new thing to Windows. It will be a
long time before all Windows software is designed to be used by a restricted
user. Until then, viruses and malware will have free reign on Windows machines. Certainly software
written for Windows 95, 98 and Me expects total system access and may not work
when run from a restricted userid.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p>The difference in OS development methodologies may explain why Linux is
considered more stable. Windows is developed by faceless
programmers whose mistakes are hidden from the outside world because Microsoft
does not publish the underlying code for Windows. They consider it a trade
secret.&nbsp;In contrast, Linux is developed by hundreds of programmers all over the
world. They publish the source code for the operating system and any
interested programmer, anywhere in the world can review it. Besides the wide audience for peer review,
there is likely to be pride of ownership on the part of the developers of Linux that
can not exist with Windows. The <i>official</i> term is &quot;egoboo&quot; which
refers to the rush a programmer gets from public recognition, especially for
something done for free.

Windows 2000, XP and NT4. They would prefer customers to move off of NT4, thus
making Microsoft more money. It is their ball, their bat and their field. This
is not true with an open source operating system such as Linux. No one can
decree that bug will not be fixed in a specific version of Linux.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><b>Software restrictions: </b><font face="Verdana" size="2">A program written
for Linux will not run under Windows and vice versa. For example, Microsoft
makes a version of Office for Windows and another version for the Mac. They are
two different products, each capable of only running on the operating system it
was designed for. There is no version of Microsoft Office for Linux. Some
programs, such as Firefox, are available for multiple operating systems (Firefox
runs on Linux, Windows, Macs and more). Vendors of such software go to the
trouble of making different versions for each supported operating system.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"> This is the rule, but there
are a fair number of exceptions. &nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The most ambitious exceptions allow for

running Linux (referred to as the host or native OS), you can install a copy of
Windows (referred to, in this case, as the guest OS). In the Windows OS running
under Linux, you can install any and all Windows programs. Somewhat like a split
personality, one computer can run two operating systems at the same time. The
guest operating system runs in an environment referred to as a virtual machine

<p><b>Hardware the OS runs on:</b><font face="Verdana" size="2"> (Updated March
2005) Linux runs on
many different hardware platforms, not so with Windows. For example, Windows NT

on Alpha CPUs, again, until Microsoft changed their mind. No one gets to change
their mind with Linux. It runs on a very wide range of computers, from the
lowest of the low to the highest of the high. The supported range of computers
is all but stunning.&nbsp; </font></p>

<p><b>Multiple Users:</b><font face="Verdana" size="2"> Linux is a multi-user
system, Windows is not. That is, Windows is designed to be used by one person at
a time. Databases running under Windows allow concurrent access by multiple
users, but the Operating System itself is designed to deal with a single human
being at a time. Linux, like all Unix variants, is designed to handle multiple
concurrent users. Windows, of course, can run many programs concurrently, as can
Linux. There is a multi-user version of Windows called Terminal Server but this
is not the Windows pre-installed on personal computers.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><b>Networking:</b><font face="Verdana" size="2"> They both do TCP/IP. Linux
can do Windows networking, which means that a Linux computer can appear on a
network of Windows computers and share its files and printers.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><b>Hard disk partitions:</b><font face="Verdana" size="2"> Windows must boot
from a primary partition. Linux can boot from either a primary partition or a
logical partition inside an extended partition. Windows must boot from the first
hard disk. Linux can boot from any hard disk in the computer.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><b>Swap files: </b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Windows uses a hidden file
for its swap file. Typically this file resides in the same partition as the OS
(advanced users can opt to put the file in another partition). Linux uses a
dedicated partition for its swap file (advanced users can opt to implement the
swap file as a file in the same partition as the OS).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><b>File Systems:</b><font face="Verdana" size="2"> (updated March 2005) Windows uses FAT12,
FAT16, FAT32 and/or NTFS with NTFS almost always being the best choice. Linux also has a number of its own native file systems.
The default file system for Linux used to be ext2, now it is
typically ext3.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"> File systems can be either journaled or not. Non-journaled
systems are subject to problems when stopped abruptly. All the FAT variants and
ext2 are non-journaled. After a crash, they should be examined by their
respective health check utilities (Scan Disk or Check Disk or fsck). In
contrast, when a journaled file system is stopped abruptly, recovery is automatic at the next
reboot. NTFS is journaled. Linux supports several journaled file systems: "ext3",
&quot;reiserfs&quot; and &quot;jfs&quot;.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">All the file systems use directories and subdirectories.
Windows separates directories with a back slash, Linux uses a normal forward
slash. Windows file names are not case sensitive. Linux file names are. For
example &quot;</font><font face="Courier New" size="2">abc</font><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot; and &quot;</font><font face="Courier New" size="2">aBC</font><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot; are different files in Linux,
whereas in Windows it would refer to the same file. Case sensitivity has been a
problem for this very web page, the name of which is &quot;</font><font face="Courier New" size="2">Linux.vs.Windows.html</font><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;.
At times, people have tried to get to this page using &quot;</font><font face="Courier New" size="2">linux.vs.windows.html</font><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;
(all lower case) which resulted in a Page Not Found error. Eventually, I created
a new web page with the name in all lower case and this new page simply
re-directs you to the real page, the one you are reading now (with a capital L
and W).&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As for crossing over, Linux can read/write FAT16 and FAT32.

<p><b>File Hierarchy:&nbsp;</b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Windows and Linux
use different concepts for their file hierarchy. Windows uses a volume-based file
hierarchy, Linux uses a unified scheme. W</font><font face="Verdana" size="2">indows
uses letters of the alphabet to represent different devices and different hard
disk partitions. Under Windows, you need to know what volume (C:, D:,...) a file resides on to select
it, the file's physical location is part of it's name. In Linux all directories are attached to the root directory,
which is identified by a forward-slash, "/".
</font><font face="Verdana" size="2">For example, below are some second-level directories:<br>
</font><font size="2" face="Courier New">&nbsp; /bin/ ---- system binaries, </font><font face="Courier New" size="2"> user programs with normal user permissions<br>
&nbsp; /sbin&nbsp; --- executables that need root permission&nbsp;</font><font size="2" face="Courier New"><br>
&nbsp; /data/ --- a user defined directory<br>
&nbsp; /dev/ ---- system device tree<br>
&nbsp; /etc/ ---- system configuration<br>
&nbsp; /home/ --- users' subdirectories<br>
&nbsp; </font><font face="Courier New" size="2">/home/{username} akin to the
Windows My Documents folder</font><font size="2" face="Courier New"><br>
&nbsp; /tmp/ ---- system temporary files&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; /usr/ ---- applications software<br>
&nbsp; </font><font face="Courier New" size="2">/usr/bin - executables for programs with user permission&nbsp;</font><font size="2" face="Courier New"><br>
&nbsp; /var/ ---- system variables<br>
&nbsp; </font><font face="Courier New" size="2">/lib&nbsp;&nbsp; --- libraries needed for installed programs to run</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Every device and hard disk partition is
represented in the Linux file system as a subdirectory of the lone root
directory. For example, the floppy
disk drive in Linux might be </font><font face="Courier New" size="2"> /etc/floppy.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2">
The root directory lives in the root partition, but other directories (and the
devices they represent) can reside anywhere. Removable devices and hard disk
partitions other than the root are attached (i.e., "mounted") to subdirectories in the
directory tree. This is done either at system initialization or in response to a
mount command.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There are no standards in Linux for
which subdirectories are used for which devices. This contrasts with Windows
where the A disk is always the floppy drive and the C disk is almost always the
boot partition.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><b>Hidden Files:&nbsp;</b><font face="Verdana" size="2">  Both support the
concept of hidden files, which are files that, by default, are not shown to the
user when listing files in a directory. Linux implements this with a filename
that starts with a period. Windows tracks this as a file attribute in the file
metadata (along with things like the last update date). In both OSs the user can
over-ride the default behavior and force the system to list hidden files.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><b>Case: </b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Case sensitivity is the same with
commands as with file names. When entering commands in a DOS/command window
under any version of Windows,
&quot;dir&quot; is the same as &quot;DIR&quot;. In Linux &quot;dir&quot; is a different command
than &quot;DIR&quot;.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><b>Modems: </b><font face="Verdana" size="2">To save money, many internal
modems do not include their own processor, instead they rely on the main cpu in
the computer for their processing needs. These cheap modems are referred to as
&quot;winmodems&quot; because they typically include low level calls to the
Windows operating system that can not be replicated in Linux. For the most part,
winmodems will not work under Linux.&nbsp;If you need to run a winmodem under
Linux see <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.linmodems.org/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.linmodems.org/'" tppabs="http://www.linmodems.org/">Linmodems.org</a> and <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.linuxant.com/drivers/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.linuxant.com/drivers/'" tppabs="http://www.linuxant.com/drivers/">www.linuxant.com/drivers.</a></font></p>

<p><b>Scripting: </b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Windows started with BAT
files (a combination of OS commands and optionally its own language) and then
progressed to Windows Scripting Host (WSH) which supports two languages,
JavaScript and VB Script. Windows also has WMI, the Windows Management Interface
which makes many functions available to scripts.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"> Linux, like all Unix variants, provides multiple
scripting languages, referred to as shell scripts. Among them are the Bourne
shell, the C shell, Perl, Python and Ruby. I have used the first three, but not
Python and Ruby. I find the Linux
scripting languages cruder than WSH but much more powerful than
BAT files. They tend to use special
characters instead of English commands and don't support objects (this only
matters to programmers).&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"> One scripting
language that can run on both Linux and Windows is PHP. It always has to be
installed under Windows, it may have to be installed under Linux. PHP is
typically found running on Linux based web servers in combination with Apache,
but it is capable of running &quot;client side&quot; (on your computer).&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><b>Printer Drivers: </b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Every computer printer
ships with drivers for last last few versions of Windows (at the time it was
manufactured). Running the printer on a very old or too new version of Windows
may or may not work. Still, this a far better situation than with Linux which
does not support as many printers as Windows. In an environment with many Linux
users, shared network printers a tech support staff, this should not be an issue
as you can limit yourself to well supported printers. Home users of Linux
however, will no doubt suffer from the relatively poor support for printers.

<p><b>User Data:</b><font face="Verdana" size="2"> Windows allows programs to store user information
(files and settings) anywhere. This makes it impossibly hard to backup user data
files and settings and to switch to a new computer. In contrast, Linux stores all user data in
the home directory making it much easier to migrate from an old computer to a
new one. If home directories are segregated in their own partition, you can even
upgrade from one version of Linux to another without having to migrate user data
and settings.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><b>Shutting Down: </b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Both have to be told to
shut down and for the same reason, to quiesce in-flight activity in an orderly
manner. You shut down Windows thru the Start button, then select Shutdown. In
both the KDE and Gnome GUIs for Linux, you shut the system down by first logging
out (equivalent to logging off in Windows). In Gnome, you select the Halt
option, in KDE, the shutdown option. Linux can also be shut down from a command
prompt using the shutdown command. The shutdown command can either shut the
system down immediately or be told to shut down at some time in the future.
Windows XP also has a shutdown command, earlier versions of Windows did not.&nbsp;</font></p>

This article raises a point I agree with. The next version of Windows, the one
that will replace XP, is not going to be delivered for a long time opening up a
window of opportunity for Linux. In addition, the upcoming version of Windows is
likely to be expensive and require new hardware, two other areas where Linux
competes well.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"> It may also involve too many
changes. By the time it's delivered, more and more Linux distributions will look
more like Windows, just as Microsoft rolls out a new user interface. People
accustomed to the current Windows UI may resist the change.</font></p>

By Oliver Rist of ZDNet. December 9, 2002. The article says the cost of owning a
server OS is mostly due to the man-hours spent on maintenance. For basic file and print serving, Windows is plug-and-play,
meaning less time spent tweaking configurations. The author says that Linux
servers take longer to configure and troubleshoot than Windows servers but notes
that once this is done, Linux requires significantly less troubleshooting than Windows.
However, this only applies to standard Linux installations. Any modifications
though, and you are own your own. As to security, the author says that only someone
smart, and therefore expensive, can manage Linux security. In contrast, Windows
2000 automatic security updates can be overseen by anyone. Often Windows
security patches cause something else to drop dead, a huge waste of time, effort
and expense. The author has almost never seen this happen with Linux. </font></p>

ZDNet (UK). January 3, 2003. It was predicted that Linux will surpass the Mac OS
as the number two desktop operating system. However, its growth is being held
back by a lack of well-established applications. Despite the fact that there are
Linux programs that compete reasonably well with Microsoft Office and Outlook,
the article quotes someone as saying that companies often prefer to go with the
most popular software. The fuzzy situation with technical support when running
Microsoft Office directly under Linux (via Crossover Office) is also considered
a hindrance. On the other hand, major Linux vendors are just starting to pay
attention to the desktop market. HP will support desktops with Mandrake Linux
and the governments of assorted countries are interested in open source
software.&nbsp;
