<h3><a name="Overview">Overview</a></h3>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It goes without saying that if you have important files on your
computer, then it is
 imperative to make copies of them. If you don't know where to begin when it comes to backing up your computer, this class is for you.
The class
covers all the choices and options involved in making backups. It provides an overview of different types of backups, reviews some software in each category and covers the pros and cons of
 various hardware used to store backup files.</p>

<p>The most common type of backup is of your data files. The class covers full,
incremental and (my favorite) replication type backups for data files. In
addition, we cover backing up critical Windows system files and also
&quot;image&quot; backups of entire partitions. For each of these three types of
backups, a handful of software programs are reviewed.
Almost all the software discussed in the class is free.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As for backup hardware, the class covers CDs, DVDs, USB flash drives, four
types of external hard disks and more. We also cover Internet based or online backups. Don't trust yourself to make
backups? There are automatic backups too, that is, backups that take place
without your having to initiate them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Everyone knows backing up your computer is important, yet most people don't do it.
After this class, you will. There will be software demonstrations as
time and facilities allow.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is a 4 hour class. The material covered applies to Windows 98, 98SE, ME,
2000 and XP. The class comes with a 55 page handout.</p>

  them. Definitely worth a look...&quot;&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;</font></p>

<font face="Verdana" size="2">

<p>The class starts by categorizing the files on a computer into: Operating System (Windows) files, temporary files, application files and user data files. The backup requirements
for temporary and application files are briefly touched on.&nbsp; </p>

<ul><li>Backing up your data files</li></ul>
<blockquote><p>Data file backups are the standard backups most people use most of the time.
  This topic covers the concepts and options involved in backup software, as well as a number of different
  products. There are different types of data file backups, the class discusses:
  full, incremental, replication and differential. The products are covered from the bottom up, that is, we start with the simplest programs first and then move up the scale of options, complexity and expense. All the backup software discussed is
  free, with one exception. We cover Windows Explorer, XCOPY, Zip programs, a WSH

  2000</a> ($30).&nbsp;We briefly cover higher end backup programs, however, students get an understanding of the concepts and options involved with backing up their data files, so they are prepared to evaluate the more expensive and complicated programs should the need arise.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>


<ul><li>Backing up System files</li></ul>
<blockquote> <p>Why and when to backup critical Windows system files. The pros and cons of
  this type of backup. A review of relevant software including <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.configsafe.com/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.configsafe.com/'" tppabs="http://www.configsafe.com/">ConfigSafe</a>
  (a product from Imagine LAN), the System Restore function in Windows XP and Me
  and <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.myezfix.com/cpr.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.myezfix.com/cpr.html'" tppabs="http://www.myezfix.com/cpr.html">CPR</a> (a program to recover system files when Windows is so badly damaged that it can not start up). We do not cover
  Registry backups per se because the registry is included in backups of Windows
  system files.&nbsp; </p></blockquote>



<ul>  <li>Where to backup to?&nbsp;</li></ul>
<blockquote>
A review of assorted external backup media/drives such as: large and small external hard disks, removable cartridge devices, CD-R, CD-RW,
DVDs, assorted flash memory devices and web based or online backups.&nbsp;</blockquote>

<ul>  <li>Burning (creating) CD’s for Backups&nbsp;</li></ul>
<blockquote>
Because CDs are such a popular backup media, we cover various hardware and software issues, including
an overview of CD-R vs. CD-RW. There are many down sides to backing up to CDs
that you should be aware of before committing to them as a backup media.&nbsp;
</blockquote>

<ul>  <li>Burning DVDs for Backups&nbsp;<br>
    &nbsp;<br>
    The different types of DVDs and their pros and cons. Also, a comparison of
    DVDs vs. CDs for backups.</li></ul>

<ul>  <li>Copying Partitions &nbsp;</li></ul>
<blockquote>
Partition copies are the "gold standard" of backups. They offer guaranteed recovery from any and all software problems.
This type of backup is completely separate and distinct from file oriented backups. Partitions can be copied using either Partitioning software (such Partition Magic and Partition Commander) or disk image software (such Drive Image or Ghost). The class covers both. These tools don't copy files per se. Instead, they
make bit-by-bit, sector-by-sector copies of the hard drive partition. The pros and cons of copying partitions are compared to file oriented backups.&nbsp;</blockquote>



<ul><li>Automatic backups&nbsp;</li></ul>

<blockquote><p>These are backups that happen without user intervention and without
  having to be scheduled. Some application programs, such as those in Microsoft
  Office, can be configured to automatically make backups of a file before you
  start changing it. However, only some programs offer this feature and they may
  not keep multiple copies of the backed up files. Programs such as
  <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.roxio.com/en/company/news/archive/prelease030417faq.jhtml  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.roxio.com/en/company/news/archive/prelease030417faq.jhtml'" tppabs="http://www.roxio.com/en/company/news/archive/prelease030417faq.jhtml">GoBack</a>,
  eliminate both these problems. They run constantly in the background and back
  up every file on the computer as it is changed. The pros and cons of this type
  of software, which is not a replacement for standard data file backups, is
  discussed.</blockquote>
