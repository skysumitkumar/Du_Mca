	<li><b>In C++, what is the difference between method overloading and method overriding?</b>Overloading a method (or function) in C++ is the ability for functions of the same name to be defined as long as these methods have different signatures (different set of parameters). Method overriding is the ability of the inherited class rewriting the virtual method of the base class.</li>

			<p><b>What is pure virtual function? <br /></b> A class is made abstract by declaring one or more of its virtual functions to be pure. A pure virtual function is one with an initializer of = 0 in its declaration</p>

	<p><b>2. What is polymorphism?</b></p>
	<p>Polymorphism is the idea that a base class can be inherited by several classes. A base class pointer can point to its child class and a base class array can store different child class objects. </p>
	<p><b>3. How do you find out if a linked-list has an end? (i.e. the list is not a cycle)</b></p>
	<p>You can find out by using 2 pointers. One of them goes 2 nodes each time. The second one goes at 1 nodes each time. If there is a cycle, the one that goes 2 nodes each time will eventually meet the one that goes slower. If that is the case, then you will know the linked-list is a cycle.</p>
	</p>
	<p><b>4. How can you tell what shell you are running on UNIX system?</b></p>
	<p>You can do the Echo $RANDOM. It will return a undefined variable if you are from the C-Shell, just a return prompt if you are from the Bourne shell, and a 5 digit random numbers if you are from the Korn shell. You could also do a ps -l and look for the shell with the highest PID.</p>
	</p>
	<p><b>5. What is Boyce Codd Normal form? </b></p>
	<p>A relation schema R is in BCNF with respect to a set F of functional dependencies if for all functional dependencies in F+ of the form a-&gt;b, where a and b is a subset of R, at least one of the following holds:
<ul>
<li>a-&gt;b is a trivial functional dependency (b is a subset of a)</li>
	<li>a is a superkey for schema R</li>
</ul></p>
