                 <font face="Arial,Helvetica" size=3>Datalight products offer Microsoft Windows CE developers increased reliability, flexibility and confidence that their design will produce satisfied customers.  Since 1983, Datalight's products have been integrated into:  mobile phones, PDAs, GPS devices, data collection tools, industrial controllers, and navigation systems, allowing OEMs including Casio, Intel, and Symbol to save money, reduce development time and get to market faster. We pride ourselves in making products that solve real-world development issues.<br><br>The FlashFX Family includes single and multi-threaded flash drivers for devices using resident flash memory for mass storage. With support for more than 150 NOR and NAND flash parts, FlashFX and FlashFX Pro can be dropped into any Windows CE environment to increase product reliability or performance.  <br><br>Datalight's Reliance file system prevents data corruption in the event of an unexpected power loss or system crash.  It is the only file system designed specifically with the unique operating scenarios of embedded devices in mind.<br><br><B>Flash Driver Solutions</B><br><br>NAND Flash offers embedded developers obvious advantages.  It is also, however, notoriously tricky to manage.  Datalight’s FlashFX and FlashFX Pro offer developers a specific set of tools to make working with NAND easy.<br><br>Both FlashFX and FlashFX Pro offer rigorous bad block management, while delivering longer flash life through wear-leveling.  FlashFX Pro is multi-threaded, and has been successfully implemented in consumer devices requiring the simultaneous support of multiple operations.  Both products are ported to Windows CE.  <br><br>Key benefits include: <ul> <li> Bad block management for NAND flash<br><li> Also supports NOR flash <br><li> Speeds time to market with built-in support for more than 150 different flash parts<br><li> Longer flash life lowers warranty costs </ul> Further details on FlashFX and FlashFX Pro are available <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://datalight.com/products/flashfx/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://datalight.com/products/flashfx/'" tppabs="http://datalight.com/products/flashfx/" target="new"><u>here</u></a>.<br><br><B>Reliable File System</B><br><br>Embedded devices need a file system that will not be corrupted when power is cut.  Datalight's Reliance file system was written specifically for embedded devices and, unlike FAT-based file systems, ensures that both user and metadata are preserved in the event of an unexpected power down or system crash.<br><br>Reliance is a transactional file system that preserves the state of the disk by never overwriting good data.  New data and file structures are always written to unused disk space, and do not become a part of the disk state until a transaction has completed.  When a power glitch occurs, Reliance simply boots up and uses the last good committed state, ensuring that a Reliance disk is always consistent. Embedded devices that use Reliance are trustworthy and able to quickly boot.<br><br>Key Reliance benefits to the embedded developer include: <ul> <li> Highly reliable data storage<br><li> Faster boot because no CHKDSK utility is required<br><li> Full control over transaction settings to optimize performance<br><li> Faster and more efficient than Microsoft’s TFAT transactional alternative<br><li> Reliance is ported to Windows CE, speeding implementation </ul> Further details on Reliance are available <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://datalight.com/products/reliance/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://datalight.com/products/reliance/'" tppabs="http://datalight.com/products/reliance/" target="new"><u>here</u></a>.<br><br></font>
