<li><b>What is the purpose of finalization?</b> - The purpose of finalization is to give an unreachable object the opportunity to perform any cleanup processing before the object is garbage collected.</li>
	<li><b>What is the difference between the Boolean &#038; operator and the &#038;&#038; operator?</b> - If an expression involving the Boolean &#038; operator is evaluated, both operands are evaluated. Then the &#038; operator is applied to the operand. When an expression involving the &#038;&#038; operator is evaluated, the first operand is evaluated. If the first operand returns a value of true then the second operand is evaluated. The &#038;&#038; operator is then applied to the first and second operands. If the first operand evaluates to false, the evaluation of the second operand is skipped.</li>

<li><b>What is the relationship between local interfaces and container-managed relationships?</b> - Entity beans that have container-managed relationships with other entity beans, must be accessed in the same local scope as those related beans, and therefore typically provide a local client view. In order to be the target of a container-managed relationship, an entity bean with container-managed persistence must provide a local interface.</li>
	<li><b>What does a remove method do for different cases of beans?</b> - Stateless Session : Does not do anything to the bean as moving the bean from free pool to cache are managed by the container depending on load. Stateful Session: Removes the bean from the cache. Entity Bean: Deletes the bean (data) from persistent storage</li>
	<li><b>How does a container-managed relationship work?</b> - An entity bean accesses related entity beans by means of the accessor methods for its container-managed relationship fields, which are specified by the cmr-field elements of its abstract persistence schema defined in the deployment descriptor. Entity bean relationships are defined in terms of the local interfaces of the related beans, and the view an entity bean presents to its related beans is defined by its local home and local interfaces. Thus, an entity bean can be the target of a relationship from another entity bean only if it has a local interface.</li>

<li><b>What gives Java its &#8220;write once and run anywhere&#8221; nature?</b> - Java is compiled to be a byte code which is the intermediate language between source code and machine code. This byte code is not platorm specific and hence can be fed to any platform. After being fed to the JVM, which is specific to a particular operating system, the code platform specific machine code is generated thus making java platform independent.</li>
	<li><b>What are the four corner stones of OOP?</b> - Abstraction, Encapsulation, Polymorphism and Inheritance.</li>

	CallableStatement cs =
		con.prepareCall(&quot;{call SHOW_SUPPLIERS}&quot;);
	ResultSet rs = cs.executeQuery();

	<li><b>What are the types of messaging?</b> - There are two kinds of Messaging. Synchronous messaging involves a client that waits for the server to respond to a message. Asynchronous messaging involves a client that does not wait for a message from the server. An event is used to trigger a message from a server.
	<li><b>What is publish/subscribe messaging?</b> - With publish/subscribe message passing the sending application/client establishes a named topic in the JMS broker/server and publishes messages to this queue. The receiving clients register (specifically, subscribe) via the broker to messages by topic; every subscriber to a topic receives each message published to that topic. There is a one-to-many relationship between the publishing client and the subscribing clients. <a href="-p=136.htm#more-136" tppabs="http://www.techinterviews.com/?p=136#more-136">(more&#8230;)</a>
