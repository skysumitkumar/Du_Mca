		<h3><a href="-p=161.htm" tppabs="http://www.techinterviews.com/?p=161" rel="bookmark" title="Interview questions: MS SQL Server interview questions">MS SQL Server interview questions</a></h3>
			<p>This one always gets asked. For a while the database interview questions were limited to Oracle and generic database design questions. This is a set of more than a hundred Microsoft SQL Server interview questions. Some questions are open-ended, and some do not have answers.</p>
	<ol>
<li>What is normalization? -  Well a relational database is basically composed of tables that contain related data. So the Process of organizing this data into tables is actually referred to as normalization. </li>
	<li>What is a <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.google.com/search?num=100&  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.google.com/search?num=100&#038;hl=en&#038;lr=&#038;c2coff=1&#038;client=firefox-a&#038;oi=defmore&#038;q=define:stored+procedure'" tppabs="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&#038;hl=en&#038;lr=&#038;c2coff=1&#038;client=firefox-a&#038;oi=defmore&#038;q=define:stored+procedure">Stored Procedure</a>? -  Its nothing but a set of T-SQL statements combined to perform a single task of several tasks. Its basically like a Macro so when you invoke the Stored procedure, you actually run a set of statements. </li>
<a id="more-161"></a></p>
	<li>Can you give an example of Stored Procedure? -  sp_helpdb , sp_who2, sp_renamedb are a set of system defined stored procedures. We can also have user defined stored procedures which can be called in similar way.</li>
	<li>What is a trigger? -  Triggers are basically used to implement business rules. Triggers is also similar to stored procedures. The difference is that it can be activated when data is added or edited or deleted from a table in a database. </li>
	<li>What is a view? -  If we have several tables in a db and we want to view only specific columns from specific tables we can go for views. It would also suffice the needs of security some times allowing specfic users to see only specific columns based on the permission that we can configure on the view. Views also reduce the effort that is required for writing queries to access specific columns every time. </li>
	<li>What is an Index? -  When queries are run against a db, an index on that db basically helps in the way the data is sorted to process the query for faster and data retrievals are much faster when we have an index. </li>
	<li>What are the types of indexes available with SQL Server? -  There are basically two types of indexes that we use with the <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.microsoft.com/sql/default.asp  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.microsoft.com/sql/default.asp'" tppabs="http://www.microsoft.com/sql/default.asp">SQL Server</a>. Clustered and the Non-Clustered. </li>
	<li>What is the basic difference between <A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.sql-server-performance.com/gv_index_data_structures.asp  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.sql-server-performance.com/gv_index_data_structures.asp'" tppabs="http://www.sql-server-performance.com/gv_index_data_structures.asp">clustered and a non-clustered index</a>? -  The difference is that, Clustered index is unique for any given table and we can have only one clustered index on a table. The leaf level of a clustered index is the actual data and the data is resorted in case of clustered index. Whereas in case of non-clustered index the leaf level is actually a pointer to the data in rows so we can have as many non-clustered indexes as we can on the db. </li>
	<li>What are cursors? -  Well cursors help us to do an operation on a set of data that we retreive by commands such as Select columns from table. For example : If we have duplicate records in a table we can remove it by declaring a cursor which would check the records during retreival one by one and remove rows which have duplicate values. </li>
	<li>When do we use the UPDATE_STATISTICS command? -  This command is basically used when we do a large processing of data. If we do a large amount of deletions any modification or Bulk Copy into the tables, we need to basically update the indexes to take these changes into account. UPDATE_STATISTICS updates the indexes on these tables accordingly. </li>
	<li>Which TCP/IP port does SQL Server run on? -  SQL Server runs on port 1433 but we can also change it for better security. </li>
	<li>From where can you change the default port? -  From the Network Utility TCP/IP properties &#8211;> Port number.both on client and the server. </li>
	<li>Can you tell me the difference between DELETE &#038; TRUNCATE commands? -  Delete command removes the rows from a table based on the condition that we provide with a WHERE clause. Truncate will actually remove all the rows from a table and there will be no data in the table after we run the truncate command. </li>
	<li>Can we use Truncate command on a table which is referenced by FOREIGN KEY? -  No. We cannot use Truncate command on a table with Foreign Key because of referential integrity. </li>
	<li>What is the use of DBCC commands? -  DBCC stands for database consistency checker. We use these commands to check the consistency of the databases, i.e., maintenance,  validation task and status checks. </li>
	<li>Can you give me some DBCC command options?(Database consistency check) -  DBCC CHECKDB - Ensures that tables in the db and the indexes are correctly linked.and DBCC CHECKALLOC - To check that all pages in a db are correctly allocated. DBCC SQLPERF - It gives report on current usage of transaction log in percentage. DBCC CHECKFILEGROUP - Checks all tables file group for any damage. </li>
	<li>What command do we use to rename a db? -  sp_renamedb &#8216;oldname&#8217; , &#8216;newname&#8217; </li>
	<li>Well sometimes sp_reanmedb may not work you know because if some one is using the db it will not accept this command so what do you think you can do in such cases? -  In such cases we can first bring to db to single user using sp_dboptions and then we can rename that db and then we can rerun the sp_dboptions command to remove the single user mode. </li>
	<li>What is the difference between a HAVING CLAUSE and a WHERE CLAUSE? -  Having Clause is basically used only with the GROUP BY function in a query. WHERE Clause is applied to each row before they are part of the GROUP BY function in a query. </li>
	<li>What do you mean by COLLATION? -  Collation is basically the sort order. There are three types of sort order Dictionary case sensitive, Dictonary - case insensitive and Binary. </li>
	<li>What is a Join in SQL Server? -  Join actually puts data from two or more tables into a single result set. </li>
	<li>Can you explain the types of Joins that we can have with Sql Server? -  There are three types of joins: Inner Join, Outer Join, Cross Join </li>
	<li>When do you use <A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/adminsql/ad_mon_perf_86ib.asp  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/adminsql/ad_mon_perf_86ib.asp'" tppabs="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/adminsql/ad_mon_perf_86ib.asp">SQL Profiler</a>? -  SQL Profiler utility allows us to basically track connections to the SQL Server and also determine activities such as which SQL Scripts are running, failed jobs etc.. </li>
	<li>What is a <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.databasejournal.com/features/mssql/article.php/3085211  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.databasejournal.com/features/mssql/article.php/3085211'" tppabs="http://www.databasejournal.com/features/mssql/article.php/3085211">Linked Server</a>? -  Linked Servers is a concept in SQL Server by which we can add other SQL Server to a Group and query both the SQL Server dbs using T-SQL Statements. </li>
	<li>Can you link only other SQL Servers or any database servers such as Oracle? -  We can link any server provided we have the OLE-DB provider from Microsoft to allow a link. For Oracle we have a OLE-DB provider for oracle that microsoft provides to add it as a linked server to the sql server group. </li>
	<li>Which stored procedure will you be running to add a linked server? -  <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/tsqlref/ts_sp_adda_8gqa.asp  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/tsqlref/ts_sp_adda_8gqa.asp'" tppabs="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/tsqlref/ts_sp_adda_8gqa.asp">sp_addlinkedserver</a>, <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.dbazine.com/sharma2.shtml  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.dbazine.com/sharma2.shtml'" tppabs="http://www.dbazine.com/sharma2.shtml">sp_addlinkedsrvlogin</a></li>
	<li>What are the OS services that the SQL Server installation adds? -  MS SQL SERVER SERVICE, SQL AGENT SERVICE, DTC (Distribution transac co-ordinator) </li>
	<li>Can you explain the role of each service? -  SQL SERVER - is for running the databases SQL AGENT - is for automation such as Jobs, DB Maintanance, Backups DTC - Is for linking and connecting to other SQL Servers </li>
	<li>How do you troubleshoot SQL Server if its running very slow? -  First check the processor and memory usage to see that processor is not above 80% utilization and memory not above 40-45% utilization then check the disk utilization using Performance Monitor, Secondly, use SQL Profiler to check for the users and current SQL activities and jobs running which might be a problem. Third would be to run UPDATE_STATISTICS command to update the indexes </li>
	<li>Lets say due to N/W or Security issues client is not able to connect to server or vice versa. How do you troubleshoot? -  First I will look to ensure that port settings are proper on server and client Network utility for connections. ODBC is properly configured at client end for connection &#8212;&#8212;Makepipe &#038; readpipe are utilities to check for connection. Makepipe is run on Server and readpipe on client to check for any connection issues. </li>
	<li>What are the authentication modes in SQL Server? -  Windows mode and mixed mode (SQL &#038; Windows). </li>
	<li>Where do you think the users names and passwords will be stored in sql server? -  They get stored in master db in the sysxlogins table. </li>
	<li>What is log shipping? Can we do logshipping with SQL Server 7.0 -  Logshipping is a new feature of SQL Server 2000. We should have two SQL Server - Enterprise Editions. From Enterprise Manager we can configure the logshipping. In logshipping the transactional log file from one server is automatically updated into the backup database on the other server. If one server fails, the other server will have the same db and we can use this as the DR (disaster recovery) plan. </li>
	<li>Let us say the SQL Server crashed and you are rebuilding the databases including the master database what procedure to you follow? -  For restoring the master db we have to stop the SQL Server first and then from command line we can type SQLSERVER –m which will basically bring it into the maintenance mode after which we can restore the master db. </li>
	<li>Let us say master db itself has no backup. Now you have to rebuild the db so what kind of action do you take? -  (I am not sure- but I think we have a command to do it). </li>
	<li>What is BCP? When do we use it? - BulkCopy is a tool used to copy huge amount of data from tables and views. But it won&#8217;t copy the structures of the same. </li>
	<li>What should we do to copy the tables, schema and views from one SQL Server to another? - We have to write some DTS packages for it.  </li>

		<p>Hello,</p>
	<p>I have an issue where we have a temp table (I&#8217;ll just call it #temp for this question) where we store table info that we are creating through an app&#8230;.then once it&#8217;s changed we need to copy all of the data from that table into a global temp table&#8230;say we&#8217;ll call this one ##global&#8230;</p>
	<p>can anyone tell me a way to copy or insert all of the columns and data from #temp into ##global please? and withought having to include all the existing colum names in the #Temp tabe in the script. Is it even possible withough using a bcp to out it then another to in it from files?</p>

		<p>Hello Jason ,</p>
	<p>I think we can shoot any triger to do the job. Any app when work on #tmp table will fire the triger in the sql server, which will do the job to transfer the data from #tmp to #global.</p>
	<p>Ofcourse there may be otherway, I just point out my suggestion.</p>

	<p>A local temporary table created in a stored procedure is dropped automatically when the stored procedure completes. All other local temporary tables are dropped automatically at the end of the current session.</p>
	<p>Global temporary tables are automatically dropped when the session that created the table ends and all other tasks have stopped referencing them.

Static cursors<br />
Dynamic cursors<br />
Forward-only cursors<br />
Keyset-driven cursors </p>
	<p>Static cursors detect few or no changes but consume relatively few resources while scrolling, although they store the entire cursor in tempdb. Dynamic cursors detect all changes but consume more resources while scrolling, although they make the lightest use of tempdb. Keyset-driven cursors lie in between, detecting most changes but at less expense than dynamic cursors.
