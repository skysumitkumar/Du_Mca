		<p>Q1. No they are always passed by reference. Think. Size of structure can be arbitrarily large.<br />
Q2. Same as above.<br />
Q5. Lifetime of process.<br />
Q9. Declare a static variable, class variable, and increment(decrement) for every constructor (destructor) called.<br />
Q11. Constructor. Base to current. Destructor. current to base. Both are done recursuively.<br />
Q13. NONE<br />

		<p>Q1 - YES, a complete structure can be passed. Regarding the size, it is true that they can be very large and hence it is not a good practice to do so. In any case, one can do if one wants to.

		<p>Q3. When using macro you can&#8217;t use data type while passing it. But in Inline function you can have data types so that it can be checked.<br />
e.g MACRO : ADD(a,b)<br />
INLINE : inline void Add(int a,int b );

		<p>Q1. Yes structure can be passed by value but the overhead of copying large values will be there. hence not usable. We should pass it by pointer.<br />
Q2. Individual element can be passed by value of course. But not whole array.<br />
Q5. It is alive lifetime of process, and its scope is limited to function in which it is defined.<br />
file1.c<br />
**********<br />
static int i;<br />
void main()<br />
{<br />
&#8230;&#8230;..<br />
}<br />
file2.c<br />
**********<br />
extern int i; //error</p>
	<p>If declared global then it is visible in that file only.<br />
Q6. Object oriented language have Inheritance, polymorphism etc. But object based language only deal with object.<br />
Q7. If<br />
class D:public A,B,C<br />
{}<br />
then three ancestors<br />
Q8. public ,private, protected, virtual<br />
Q30. Hard RTS is having deadline defined and it is life critical ,should be reliable. late answer is wrong answer. in Soft RTS,process time should be predictable and reliable.

		<p>In Java, we place even the Main() function inside a CLASS.<br />
But it is not the case with C++.</p>
	<p>So, i think this is one of the answers you can say, JAVA is Fully Obejct Oriented.

		<p>Q11 : Base-class constructors are called in the order in which inheritance is specified in the derived-class definition. The order in which the Base-class constructors are specified in the derived-class member initializer list does not effect the order of construction.

		<p>Q 12:<br />
 Yes we can have.<br />
you are never guaranteed that a routine is inlined. It is only a suggestion to the compiler.  If<br />
the routine is either too complicated or a virtual function,then a static copy of the routine will be placed in the compiled module.   Thus, a routine that was coded as inline may cause a performance degradation because it may consume much more space when it is not physically inlined.<br />
With a virtual function, a copy of that routine will be created for every module that has at least one instantiation of that class. </p>
	<p>Q 13:<br />
NONE.<br />
None of the Public, Protected and Private data members are visible.</p>
	<p>Q 16:<br />
YES. We can have a const volatile variable.<br />
a volatile variable is a variable which can be changed by the extrenal events (like an interrput timers will increment the voltile varible. If you dont want you volatile varibale to be changed then declare them as &#8220;const volatile&#8221;.</p>
	<p>Q 17.<br />
I will explain this with an example:</p>
	<p>int a = 10;<br />
int *p =  &#038;a;<br />
// suppose &amp;a = 4010 (address of a)</p>
	<p>Because both ++ and * are unary operators, the are calculated from right to left &#8211;&gt;   ++ (*p)</p>
	<p>++*p will inrement 4010 by 4 (int size)  -&gt; ++*p  will have the value 4014.</p>
	<p>Q 21:<br />
It will print 8 times. Because, each fork will print twice.<br />
if u flush, (using &#8220;fflush&#8221;), then it will be printed only once. thats is you need to flush the iostreams.</p>
	<p>Q 30:</p>
	<p>In Hard RTOS the latency should be less the 20ns (nano sec)<br />
in Soft RTOS the latency range 3ns - 20ns is also acceptable.
