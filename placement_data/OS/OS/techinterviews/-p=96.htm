		<p>Some of these questions are operating system specific (size of command line arguments, for example), and others have nothing to do with being a good c programmer (what the &#8216;c&#8217; and &#8216;v&#8217; stand for in argc and argv, come on). Otherwise, many of these questions are good, and will differentiate between someone who has written a few lines of C, and someone who has spent a few years with C.

		<p>Iam not getting the correct pros and cons of the strcpy() and memcpy()<br />
 some where i read for short strings strcpy is faster and for large strings memcpy is faster..<br />
in strcpy() there is a single pass over the data&#8230;but in memcpy() there are 2 passes..one is for strlen() and another is for copying..<br />
but how memcpy will be faster for large strings?</p>
	<p>Can anybody please clear my doubt</p>

		<p>Answer for the static variable:</p>
	<p>there are 3 main uses for the static.<br />
1. If you declare within a function:<br />
It retains the value between function calls</p>
	<p>2.If it is declared for a function name:<br />
By default function is extern..so  it will be visible from other files<br />
if the function declaration is as static..it is invisible for the outer files</p>
	<p>3. Static for global variables:</p>
	<p>By default we can  use the global variables from outside files<br />
If it is static global..that variable is limitied to with in the file

	<p>Q. What is a linklist and why do we use it when we have arrays.<br />
A. Most of people ans it as link list is a colletion of nodes or for dynamic accepting of values from user and blah blah&#8230;but i feel the correct answer should be linklist is used in cases where you don&#8217;t know the memory required to store a data structure and need to allocate is dynamically on demand.

		<p>Hi Ramya,<br />
As u asked the fearture that can be used in c++ but not in c.and u want to know advantage<br />
eg. macro #define max(a,b) ( (a) > (b) ? (a): (b))<br />
int a=5, b=0<br />
max(++a,b) // a is incremented twice<br />
max(++a,b+10) // a is incremented once  this is the problem with macro,this problem can be solved by inline.<br />
another one is so simple earlier c style commment<br />
if (a > b)<br />
{<br />
   /* int temp=a;     /* swap a and b*/<br />
    a=b;<br />
    b=temp;<br />
   */<br />
}notice how the embedded comment inadvertently puts a premature end to the comment.<br />

		<p>Q. Advantages of a macro over a function?<br />
A. Macro gets to see the Compilation environment, so it<br />
   can expand __DATE__ __TIME__ __FILE__ #defines. It<br />
   is expanded by the preprocessor.  </p>
	<p>   For example, you can&#8217;t do this without macros<br />
   #define PRINT(EXPR)  printf( #EXPR &#8220;=%d\n&#8221;, EXPR)</p>
	<p>   PRINT( 5+6*7 )  // expands into printf(&#8221;5+6*7=%d&#8221;, 5+6*7 );</p>
	<p>   You can define your mini language with macros:<br />
   #define strequal(A,B)  (!strcmp(A,B))</p>
	<p>Macros are a necessary evils of life. The purists don&#8217;t like them,<br />
but without it no real work gets done.

		<p>What are the differences between malloc() and calloc()? </p>
	<p>Ans:</p>
	<p>There are 2 differences. </p>
	<p>First, is in the number of arguments. malloc() takes a single argument(memory required in bytes), while calloc() needs 2 arguments(number of variables to allocate memory, size in bytes of a single variable). </p>
	<p>Secondly, malloc() doesnot initialize the memory allocated, while calloc() initializes the allocated memory to ZERO.

		<p>22. What are the different storage classes in C?</p>

    storage duration.</p>
	<p>    Variables with block scope, and with static specifier have static scope.<br />

		<p>Q:  What is the difference between strings and character arrays?</p>
	<p>A:  A major difference is: string will have static storage duration, whereas as<br />
    a character array will not, unless it is explicity specified by using the<br />
    static keyword.</p>
	<p>    Actually, a string is a character array with following properties:</p>
	<p>        * the multibyte character sequence, to which we generally call string,<br />
          is used to initialize an array of static storage duration.  The size<br />
          of this array is just sufficient to contain these characters plus<br />
          the terminating NUL character.</p>
	<p>        * it not specified what happens if this array, i.e., string, is<br />
          modified.</p>
	<p>        * Two strings of same value[1] may share same memory area.  For example,<br />
          in the following declarations:</p>
	<p>            char *s1 = &#8220;Calvin and Hobbes&#8221;;<br />
            char *s2 = &#8220;Calvin and Hobbes&#8221;;</p>
	<p>          the strings pointed by s1 and s2 may reside in the same memory<br />
          location.  But, it is not true for the following:</p>
	<p>            char ca1[] = &#8220;Calvin and Hobbes&#8221;;<br />
            char ca2[] = &#8220;Calvin and Hobbes&#8221;;</p>
	<p>[1] The value of a string is the sequence of the values of the contained<br />
    characters, in order.

	<p>Each compiler is free to define the behaviour of malloc(), when<br />
the size is 0.  Usually, the compiler documents how it does.<br />
Two possibilies are:</p>
	<p>When the requested size is zero<br />
* return a NULL pointer.<br />
* Assume some non-zero size </p>
	<p>In either case, using the return value malloc() can cause undefined<br />
behaviour.</p>

		<p>In response to the comment number 11: &#8220;features that can be used in C++ and not in C&#8221;</p>
	<p>The simple answer is all OO related features can not be used in C!  If your question was<br />
other way round, i.e.: &#8220;What is allowed in C, but not in C++?&#8221;   then read this:</p>
	<p>[http://www.geocities.com/vijoeyz/faq/c/notcpp.txt]</p>
	<p>    Following are few differece in C and C++.  Few of these are allowed in<br />
C++, but with a different meaning; while some are illegal.</p>
	<p>1.  sizeof (&#8217;1&#8242;) == sizeof (int) in C; but it is sizeof (char) in C++.</p>
	<p>2.  You generally should NOT use *alloc()/free() in C++; but they are the<br />
    only such functions in C.  Use new and delete combination, instead.</p>
	<p>3.  Functions need not be prototyped in C; but, it&#8217;s a must in C++.<br />
    Peter Nilsson says: </p>
	<p>       &#8220;C99 changed from C90 in that named functions must be _declared_ prior<br />
        to usage, but there is still no requirement that the function be<br />
        prototyped. [The exception being variadic functions like printf,<br />
        which have always required prototypes in standard C.]&#8221; </p>
	<p>4.  struct a {<br />
        struct b {<br />
            int a;<br />
        };<br />
    };</p>
	<p>    struct b b;         /* allowed in C; but, not in C++ */</p>
	<p>5.  const int b = 1;    /* allowed in C and C++ */<br />
    const int a;        /* allowed in C, but not in C++ */</p>
	<p>6.  Global variables can be defined more than once in C, not in C++.<br />
    int a;              /* both in C and C++ */<br />
    int a = 10;         /* legal in C; illegal in C++ */</p>
	<p>7.  const a;            /* allowed in C; illegal in C++ */</p>
	<p>    This is equivalent to const int a; in C.</p>
	<p>8.  char s[7] = &#8220;vijoeyz&#8221;;  /* error in C++, but allowed in C */</p>
	<p>9.  K&amp;R style function definitions are not allowed in C++.  Example:</p>
	<p>    void mango ( a )<br />
    int a;<br />
    {   &#8230;  }

	<p>This is pretty implementation-specific issue.  It depends on the host operating system.<br />
The simple function of malloc() is try to allocate the requested number of bytes; if not<br />
possible, return NULL.</p>
	<p>The documents provided by your implementation might tell you the limits, if any.

passed to a variable argument list function?</p>
	<p>In the following function prototype, the first parameter holds the number<br />
of arguments you pass to some_function().</p>
	<p>void some_function ( int no_of_args, &#8230; );</p>
	<p>Alternately, use a counter and increment it every time you use va_arg() macro<br />

		<p>In response to the comment number 29, filed by Dipak G Patil:</p>
	<p>Why does malloc(0) return valid memory address ? Whats the use ?</p>
	<p>malloc(0) does not return a non-NULL under every implementation.<br />
    An implementation is free to behave in a manner it finds<br />
suitable, if the allocation size requested is zero.  The<br />
implmentation may choose any of the following actions:</p>
	<p>    * A null pointer is returned.</p>
	<p>    * The behavior is same as if a space of non-zero size<br />
      was requested.  In this case, the usage of return<br />
      value yields to undefined-behavior.  </p>
	<p>Notice, however, that if the implementation returns a non-NULL<br />
value for a request of a zero-length space, a pointer to object<br />
of ZERO length is returned!  Think, how an object of zero size<br />
should be represented?  </p>
	<p>For implementations that return non-NULL values, a typical usage<br />
is as follows:</p>
	<p>void<br />
func ( void )<br />
{<br />
    int *p;     /* p is a one-dimensional array,<br />
                   whose size will vary during the<br />
                   the lifetime of the program */<br />
    size_t c;</p>
	<p>    p = malloc(0);  /* initial allocation */<br />
    if (!p)<br />
    {<br />
        perror (&#8221;FAILURE&#8221; );<br />
        return;<br />
    }</p>
	<p>    /* &#8230; */</p>
	<p>    while (1)<br />
    {<br />
        c = (size_t) &#8230; ; /* Calculate allocation size */<br />
        p = realloc ( p, c * sizeof *p );</p>
	<p>        /* use p, or break from the loop */<br />
        /* &#8230; */<br />
    }<br />
    return;<br />
}</p>
	<p>Notice that this program is not portable, since an implementation<br />
is free to return NULL for a malloc(0) request, as the C Standard<br />
does not support zero-sized objects.

		<p>Hi Fellow Programmers!</p>
	<p>One of you is asking for the solution of detecting the biggest number out of three variables without using comparison operators. The solution could be implemented in assembly as put in comment #63, but since the operation cmp is used, you are comparing two values and that was not allowed in this solution. The final solution can, as I said before, be implemented in assembly, but you have to go back to the basics. First of all, try to get the biggest number out of 2 variables. When you have found the answer, than from that point you can build your solution using 3 variables. Here is the solution in plain c:</p>
	<p>int biggest_number(int x, int y)<br />
{<br />
  return ((x + y) + abs(x - y)) &gt;&gt; 1 /* A division by 2 is also a method&#8230; */<br />
  /* By the way, we use abs because we can&#8217;t tell if the outcome is positive or negative<br />
   * since we do not know which variable contains the biggest number. The abs function is<br />
   * seems like function in which if statements are needed, but this is not the the case&#8230;<br />
   */<br />
}</p>
	<p>The total solution will be:</p>
	<p>int biggest_out_of_three(int x, int y, int z)<br />
{<br />
  int a;<br />
  a = ((x + y) + abs(x - y)) &gt;&gt; 1;<br />
  return ((a + z) + abs(a - z)) &gt;&gt; 1;<br />
}</p>
	<p>It&#8217;s that simple&#8230; I guess&#8230;

	<p>Quote: &#8220;How do i traverse a singly linked list backwards?&#8221;</p>
	<p>One solution could be using a stack. First, you have to traverse each item in the list<br />
and add the pointer of that item onto the stack. When you are at the end of your linked list,<br />
you can pop each pointer of the stack, which results in a backward traversal.
