	<li>Which is worse: not testing your programs or not commenting your programs?</li>
	<li>Name several ways to achieve efficiency in your program. Explain trade-offs.</li>
	<li>What other SAS products have you used and consider yourself proficient in using?</li>
	<li>How do you make use of functions?</li>
	<li>When looking for contained in a character string of 150 bytes, which function is the best to locate that data: scan, index, or indexc?</li>
	<li>What is the significance of the &#8216;OF&#8217; in X=SUM(OF a1-a4, a6, a9);?</li>

How would you accomplish this in data step code? Using only PROC FORMAT.</li>
	<li>In the following DATA step, what is needed for &#8216;fraction&#8217; to print to the log? data _null_; x=1/3; if x=.3333 then put &#8216;fraction&#8217;; run;</li>
	<li>What is the difference between calculating the &#8216;mean&#8217; using the mean function and PROC MEANS?</li>
	<li>Have you ever used &#8220;Proc Merge&#8221;? (be prepared for surprising answers..)</li>
	<li>If you were given several SAS data sets you were unfamiliar with, how would you find out the variable names and formats of each dataset?</li>
	<li>What SAS PROCs have you used and consider yourself proficient in using?</li>

	<li>Produce output from a frequency. Restrict the printing of the table.</li>
	<li>Code a PROC MEANS that shows both summed and averaged output of the data.</li>
