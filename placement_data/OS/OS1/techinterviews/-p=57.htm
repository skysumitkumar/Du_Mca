			<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
<li class=MsoNormal style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo3;tab-stops:list .5in'><b>What&#8217;s the advantage of using System.Text.StringBuilder over System.String? </b>StringBuilder is more efficient in the cases, where a lot of manipulation is done to the text. Strings are immutable, so each time it&#8217;s being operated on, a new instance is created.</li>
<a id="more-57"></a><br />
<li class=MsoNormal style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo3;tab-stops:list .5in'><b>Can you store multiple data types in System.Array? </b>No.</li>
	<li class=MsoNormal style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo3;tab-stops:list .5in'><b>What&#8217;s the difference between the System.Array.CopyTo() and System.Array.Clone()? </b>The first one performs a deep copy of the array, the second one is shallow.</li>
	<li class=MsoNormal style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo3;tab-stops:list .5in'><b>How can you sort the elements of the array in descending order? </b>By calling Sort() and then Reverse() methods.<b><o :p></o></b></li>
	<li class=MsoNormal style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo3;tab-stops:list .5in'><b>What&#8217;s the .NET datatype that allows the retrieval of data by a unique key? </b>HashTable.<b><o :p></o></b></li>
	<li class=MsoNormal style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo3;tab-stops:list .5in'><b>What&#8217;s class SortedList underneath? </b>A sorted HashTable.<b><o :p></o></b></li>
	<li class=MsoNormal style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo3;tab-stops:list .5in'><b>Will <i>finally</i> block get executed if the exception had not occurred? </b>Yes.<b><o :p></o></b></li>
	<li class=MsoNormal style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo3;tab-stops:list .5in'><b>What&#8217;s the C# equivalent of C++ catch (&#8230;), which was a catch-all statement for any possible exception? </b>A catch block that catches the exception of type System.Exception. You can also omit the parameter data type in this case and just write catch {}.<b><o :p></o></b></li>
	<li class=MsoNormal style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo3;tab-stops:list .5in'><b>Can multiple catch blocks be executed? </b>No, once the proper catch code fires off, the control is transferred to the finally block (if there are any), and then whatever follows the finally block.<b><o :p></o></b></li>
	<li class=MsoNormal style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo3;tab-stops:list .5in'><b>Why is it a bad idea to throw your own exceptions? </b>Well, if at that point you know that an error has occurred, then why not write the proper code to handle that error instead of passing a new Exception object to the catch block? Throwing your own exceptions signifies some design flaws in the project.<b><o :p></o></b></li>
	<li class=MsoNormal style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo3;tab-stops:list .5in'><b>What&#8217;s a delegate? </b>A delegate object encapsulates a reference to a method. In C++ they were referred to as function pointers.<b><o :p></o></b></li>
	<li class=MsoNormal style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo3;tab-stops:list .5in'><b>What&#8217;s a multicast delegate? </b>It&#8217;s a delegate that points to and eventually fires off several methods.<b><o :p></o></b></li>

	<p>Good Interview Questions. Helped me a lot.<br />

		<p>In reply to KK&#8217;s comment: Actually you can change the value of variables by using the command window. Type IMMED in the command window prompt to switch to immediate mode which will get rid of the &#8220;>&#8221;. TO manipulate a variable in the command window, type strCustomerName.Value = &#8220;TechInterview INC&#8221; or txtComments.innerText = &#8220;New String value&#8221; and it will override the old value in strCustomerName with the new value.

		<p>how can we use sessionstate using sqlserver method?

	<li id="comment-511">
		<p>Arun >> I understand your question to be &#8220;how can session information/data be stored using a SQL server?&#8221;</p>
	<p>At work we use an Oracle 9i db to store our session info by removing the standard session provided by .NET and forcing our own session implementation in the web.config file.  </p>
	<p>So to answer your question, in order to store ASP.NET session information inside SQL Server you must: </p>
	<p>1) Have SQL Server version 7 or 2000 installed. </p>
	<p>2) Execute the following script using SQL Server&#8217;s Query Analyzer, which creates the database that ASP.NET uses to store Session:</p>
	<p><code> \%winroot%\Microsoft.NET\Framework\versionNum\InstallSqlState.sql<br />
</code><br />
3. Modify the web.config file appropriately (where the connectionString attribute denotes the connection string that should be used to open the database):<br />
<code>&#60;sessionState mode="SQLServer" sqlConnectionString=<br />
   "data source=127.0.0.1;user sa;password=" /&#62;<br />
</code></p>
	<p>Storing Session inside SQL Server is the most durable option, as information persists even if the machine crashes. This is the slowest option of the three, however, because session data must be accessed from disk rather than directly from memory, a process thousands of times slower. Note that as with the Windows Service option, you can point ASP.NET to a Session store on a different machine, which is also appropriate in Web farm settings.

	<li id="comment-924">
		<p>A couple of (probably picky) corrections:</p>
	<p>10 &#8212; you should throw your own exceptions when changing the type of an exception will give more information to the layer that you&#8217;ve decided should handle the exception, so you might wrap a FileNotFound exception in a custom &#8220;CantOpenConfigFileException&#8221; class for example. Rather than always attempting to handle errors in the method that threw the exception, you should define points in your architecture at which you&#8217;ve decided exceptions should be trapped and corrective code run.</p>
	<p>40 &#8212; it doesn&#8217;t delete it from memory, it closes any resources (e.g. returns the underlying database connection to the connection pool). The garbage collector will delete the object from memory at some undefined point in the future.</p>
	<p>41 &#8212; technically the decision on whether to use a pooled connection is made by a string comparison of the connection string being opened and that in the pool, so even though the parameters might be functionally the same, a difference in case or an extra space will cause the pooled connection not to be used.
