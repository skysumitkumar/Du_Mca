			<p><b>1. How do you write a function that can reverse a linked-list? (Cisco System)</b></p>
	<pre>void reverselist(void)
{
	<font color=\"#0000FF\">if</font>(head==0)
		return;
	<font color=\"#0000FF\">if</font>(head-&gt;next==0)
		return;
	<font color=\"#0000FF\">if</font>(head-&gt;next==tail)
	{
		head-&gt;next = 0;
		tail-&gt;next = head;
	}
	<font color=\"#0000FF\">else</font>
	{
		node* pre = head;
		node* cur = head-&gt;next;
		node* curnext = cur-&gt;next;
		head-&gt;next = 0;
		cur-&gt;next = head;</pre>
	<pre>		<font color=\"#0000FF\">for</font>(; curnext!=0; )

	<p><b>2. What is polymorphism?</b></p>
	<p>Polymorphism is the idea that a base class can be inherited by several classes. A base class pointer can point to its child class and a base class array can store different child class objects. </p>
	<p><b>3. How do you find out if a linked-list has an end? (i.e. the list is not a cycle)</b></p>
	<p>You can find out by using 2 pointers. One of them goes 2 nodes each time. The second one goes at 1 nodes each time. If there is a cycle, the one that goes 2 nodes each time will eventually meet the one that goes slower. If that is the case, then you will know the linked-list is a cycle.</p>
	</p>
	<p><b>4. How can you tell what shell you are running on UNIX system?</b></p>
	<p>You can do the Echo $RANDOM. It will return a undefined variable if you are from the C-Shell, just a return prompt if you are from the Bourne shell, and a 5 digit random numbers if you are from the Korn shell. You could also do a ps -l and look for the shell with the highest PID.</p>
	</p>
	<p><b>5. What is Boyce Codd Normal form? </b></p>
	<p>A relation schema R is in BCNF with respect to a set F of functional dependencies if for all functional dependencies in F+ of the form a-&gt;b, where a and b is a subset of R, at least one of the following holds:
<ul>
<li>a-&gt;b is a trivial functional dependency (b is a subset of a)</li>
	<li>a is a superkey for schema R</li>
</ul></p>

		<p>There is error in algorithm in first answer. In for-loop instead of line<br />
curnext = curnext->next </p>
	<p>should be the following code lines<br />
if (curnext->next)<br />
   curnext = curnext->next;</p>
	<p>Good luck!

	<p>Your suggestion won&#8217;t work if the cycle occurs in the middle of the list and doesn&#8217;t go back to the head.

		<p>The idea of the linked list function it to make it recursive.
</p>
	<p><cite>Tech Interviews comment by <b>Leo</b></cite> </p>
	</li>

	<li id="comment-6167">
		<p>About the reverselist.<br />
I was asked why it is wrong to implement it recursive?<br />
What is the right answer for that?
</p>
	<p><cite>Tech Interviews comment by <b>Ellen</b></cite> </p>
	</li>

	<li id="comment-6940">
		<p>recursion has some overhead and a performance penalty. whenever a function is called, the processor has to save some variables (the status register of the processor, and the program counter and the return-address) on the stack. then it has to push the parameters on the stack, and then the function is finally called, </p>
	<p>whenever you call a function, this whole procedure is repeated. therefore some people think that recursion is &#8220;slower&#8221;. and of course the stack is not indefinite - endless recursion leads to a stack overflow.</p>
	<p>when i say that recursion is &#8220;slower&#8221; then keep in mind that the procedure described above is a matter of nanoseconds on a modern processor. so speed is usually not an issue. (of course it depends on your hardware environment). recursion is usually the far more elegant solution, less complicated than iterative programming.</p>
