<p><font size="4"><strong>Overview</strong></font><br>
This module introduces you to the subject of operating systems.
It is an introductory course that will take you approximately 30-40
hours to complete (including the exercises) depending upon your
level of prior knowledge.</p>

An operating system (OS) is a collection of system programs that
together control the operation of a computer system.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

An operating system controls the way in which the computer system
functions. In order to do this, the operating system includes
programs that</p>

<ul>
    <li>initialize the hardware of the computer system</li>
    <li>provide basic routines for device control</li>
    <li>provide for the management, scheduling and interaction of
        tasks</li>
    <li>maintain system integrity and handle errors</li>
</ul>

There are many types of operating systems, the complexity of
which varies depending upon what type of functions are provided,
and what the system is being used for. Some systems are
responsible for managing many users on a network. Other operating
systems do not manage user programs at all. These are typically
found in hardware devices like petrol pumps, airplanes, video
recorders, washing machines and car engines.</p>

security control system</font><br>
An operating system for a security control system (such as a home
alarm system) would consist of a number of programs. One of these
programs would gain control of the computer system when it is
powered on, and initialize the system.</p>

<table border="0">

        <td valign="top">The first task of this initialize
        program would be to reset (and probably test) the
        hardware sensors and alarms. Once the hardware
        initialization was complete, the operating system would
        enter a continual monitoring routine of all the input
        sensors. If the state of any input sensor changed, it
        would branch to an alarm generation routine.</td>

Input and output devices are components that form part of the
computer system. These devices are controlled by the operating
system.</p>

<p>Input devices provide input signals such as commands to the
operating system. These commands received from input devices
instruct the operating system to perform some task or control its
behavior. Typical input devices are a keyboard, mouse,
temperature sensor, air-flow valve or door switch. In the
previous example of our simple security control system, the input
devices could be door switches, alarm keypad panel and smoke
detector units.</p>

<p>Output devices are instruments that receive commands or
information from the operating system. Typical output devices are
monitor screens, printers, speakers, alarm bells, fans, pumps,
control valves, light bulbs and sirens.</p>

<p><a name="single"></a> <a href="#start"><font size="4"><strong><img src="os01_files/up.gif" border="0" height="15" width="15"></strong></font></a><font size="4"><strong> </strong>What is a single-user operating system?</font><br>
We are all familiar with the concept of sitting down at a
computer system and writing documents or performing some task
such as writing a letter. In this instance there is one keyboard
and one monitor that you interact with.</p>

<p>Operating systems such as Windows 95, Windows NT Workstation
and Windows 2000 professional are essentially single user
operating systems. They provide you the capability to perform
tasks on the computer system such as writing programs and
documents, printing and accessing files.</p>

<p>Consider a typical home computer. There is a single keyboard
and mouse that accept input commands, and a single monitor to
display information output. There may also be a printer for the
printing of documents and images.</p>

<p>In essence, a single-user operating system provides access to
the computer system by a single user at a time. If another user
needs access to the computer system, they must wait till the
current user finishes what they are doing and leaves.</p>

<p>Students in computer labs at colleges or University often
experience this. You might also have experienced this at home,
where you want to use the computer but someone else is currently
using it. You have to wait for them to finish before you can use
the computer system.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="multi"></a> <a href="#start"><font size="4"><strong><img src="os01_files/up.gif" border="0" height="15" width="15"></strong></font></a><font size="4"><strong> </strong>What is a multi-user operating system?</font><br>
A multi-user operating system lets more than one user access the
computer system at one time. Access to the computer system is
normally provided via a network, so that users access the
computer remotely using a terminal or other computer.</p>

<table border="0">
    <tbody><tr>
        <td valign="top">In the early days of large multi-user
        computers, multiple terminals (keyboards and associated
        monitors) were provided. These terminals sent their
        commands to the main multi-user computer for processing,
        and the results were then displayed on the associated
        terminal monitor screen. Terminals were hard-wired
        directly to the multi-user computer system.</td>
        <td><img src="os01_files/fep.jpg" height="130" width="130"></td>
    </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>Today, these terminals are generally personal computers and
use a network to send and receive information to the multi-user
computer system. Examples of multi-user operating systems are
UNIX, Linux (a UNIX clone) and mainframes such as the IBM AS400.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="os01_files/network.jpg" height="197" width="400"></p>

<p>The operating system for a large multi-user computer system
with many terminals is much more complex than a single-user
operating system. It must manage and run all user requests,
ensuring they do not interfere with each other. Devices that are
serial in nature (devices which can only be used by one user at a
time, like printers and disks) must be shared amongst all those
requesting them (so that all the output documents are not jumbled
up). If each user tried to send their document to the printer at
the same time, the end result would be garbage. Instead,
documents are sent to a queue, and each document is printed in
its entirety before the next document to be printed is retrieved
from the queue. When you wait inline at the cafeteria to be
served you are in a queue. Imagine that all the people in the
queue are documents waiting to be printed and the cashier at the
end of the queue is the printer.</p>

The operating system consists of hundreds of thousands of lines
of program code and stored on hard disk. Portions of the
operating system are loaded into computer system memory (RAM)
when needed. Utilities are provided for</p>

<ul>
    <li>Managing Files and Documents</li>
    <li>Development of Programs and Software</li>
    <li>Communicating between people and with other computer
        systems</li>
    <li>Managing user requirements for programs, storage space
        and priority</li>

In addition, the operating system provides each user with an
interface that accepts, interprets and executes user commands or
programs. This interface is commonly called a SHELL or command
line interpreter (CLI). In some systems this might be a simple
text mode line-by-line entry using keywords (such as MSDOS or
UNIX), in other systems it might be highly graphical using
windows and a pointing device such as a mouse (such as X-Windows).</p>

<p><a name="probs"></a> <a href="#start"><font size="4"><strong><img src="os01_files/up.gif" border="0" height="15" width="15"></strong></font></a><font size="4"><strong> </strong>Advantages and problems of multi-user
operating systems</font><br>
The advantage of having a multi-user operating system is that
normally the hardware is very expensive, and it lets a number of
users share this expensive resource. This means the cost is
divided amongst the users. It also makes better use of the
resources. Since the resources are shared, they are more likely
to be in use than sitting idle being unproductive.</p>

<p>One problem with multi-user computer systems is that as more
users access it, the performance becomes slower and slower.
Another disadvantage is the cost of hardware, as a multi-user
operating system requires a lot of disk space and memory. In
addition, the actual software for multi-user operating systems
tend to cost more than single-user operating systems.</p>

<p><a name="multitask"></a> <a href="#start"><font size="4"><strong><img src="os01_files/up.gif" border="0" height="15" width="15"></strong></font></a><font size="4"><strong> </strong>What is a multi-tasking operating
system?</font><br>
A multi-tasking operating system provides the ability to run more
than one program at once. For example, a user could be running a
word processing package, printing a document, copying files to
the floppy disk and backing up selected files to a tape unit.
Each of these tasks the user is doing appears to be running at
the same time.</p>

<p>A multi-tasking operating system has the advantage of letting
the user run more than one task at once, so this leads to
increased productivity. The disadvantage is that more programs
that are run by the user, the more memory that is required. </p>
