Windows operating systems?</font><br>
This section outlines the typical hardware requirements for the
Windows operating systems. You should be aware that these are
recommended figures, and in actual practice more memory and disk
space is recommended if you intend to run applications and
programs in addition to the base Windows operating system.</p>

<p><strong>System requirements for Windows 95</strong></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>386DX or higher<br>
    4MB memory or higher [8MB recommended]<br>
    35-40MB disk space<br>
    3.5" floppy drive or CD-ROM <br>
    VGA or higher resolution graphics card</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>System requirements for Windows 98</strong></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>486DX/66MHz or higher <br>
    16MB memory or higher <br>
    195MB disk space <br>
    CD-ROM <br>
    VGA or higher resolution graphics card</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>System requirements for Windows NT Workstation 4.0</strong></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>16 MB RAM Recommended <br>
    486/25MHz or higher processor <br>
    110 MB available hard-disk space <br>
    VGA, Super VGA, or video graphics adapter <br>
    CD-ROM drive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>System requirements for Windows 2000 Professional</strong></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Not known at time of printing. Software still in beta.</p>

</font>This section outlines some of the more general features
found in the Windows 95/98 and Windows NT Workstation 4.0
operating systems.</p>

<p><a name="install"></a> <a href="#start"><font size="4"><strong><img src="os09_files/up.gif" border="0" height="15" width="15"></strong></font></a><font size="4"><strong> </strong>Easy installation </font><br>
Windows can be installed from floppy disk, CDROM, or via a
network. Windows uses an installation wizard, a graphical program
designed to make installation of the operating system simpler and
friendlier.</p>

<p>Previously, when installing MSDOS or Windows 3.1 operating
systems, additional programs need to be run after installation to
add support for devices like CD-ROM's or sound cards. The Windows
wizard takes care of this, automatically searching the computer
for hardware devices like printers, network cards, CD-ROM drives,
sound cards and modems then installs the software for these at
installation time. This means Windows is easier to install and
configure than previous operating systems.</p>

<p>As the Windows installation wizard detects what the computer
hardware is, it modifies the display screens accordingly. Using a
set of easy to follow menus and dialog boxes, it guides the
installer through the installation process. When the installation
wizard is finished, it prompts the installer to reboot the
computer. At this stage, the computer has been fully installed
with the operating system and will be ready to use after the
reboot. It takes approximately 20-30 minutes to install Windows
from CD-ROM.</p>

Windows offers an improved user interface called the <strong>desktop</strong>.
The desktop consists of a screen area, and a taskbar, which is by
default at the bottom of the screen.</p>

<p>The taskbar is used for starting programs, or switching
between programs. As the user starts each program, the name of
the program is displayed on the taskbar. Clicking on the name of
the program on the taskbar will display the window associated
with that program on the desktop.</p>

<p align="center"><a name="menubar"><font face="Garamond"><img src="os09_files/taskbar1.gif" alt="Task bar for program switching" height="15" width="320"></font></a></p>

<p>The far right end of the task bar also displays the current
time and other controls. </p>

<p><strong>The Start button</strong> on the taskbar displays a
cascading menu of program choices. When a user clicks on the
Start button, a pop up menu appears. This provides easy access to
installed applications. </p>

<p><strong>The My Computer Icon</strong> on the desktop is a
shortcut to viewing what is on your computer. Double-clicking an
icon on the desktop displays the information within a window.</p>

<p><strong>The Recycle Bin Icon</strong> on the desktop is used
to hold recently deleted files. When you delete a program or file,
it is saved in the recycle bin just in case you deleted it by
accident. This allows you to recover from mistakes when you
delete something you should not have.</p>

<p><strong>The Network Neighborhood Icon</strong> on the desktop
is used to display the various resources like servers and
applications available on the network (assuming the computer is
network enabled).</p>

<p><a name="plug"></a> <a href="#start"><font size="4"><strong><img src="os09_files/up.gif" border="0" height="15" width="15"></strong></font></a><font size="4"><strong> </strong>Plug and Play Support</font><br>
Windows makes it much easier to add new hardware. It supports
Plug and Play technology, which means new hardware can be added
to the computer and Windows will automatically detect the new
hardware and install software support for it when rebooted.
Please note that adding new hardware first requires the computer
to be turned off before the hardware is added.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="add"></a> <a href="#start"><font size="4"><strong><img src="os09_files/up.gif" border="0" height="15" width="15"></strong></font></a><font size="4"><strong> </strong>Add/Remove Programs</font><br>
Adding and removing programs is also easier. Previously, the
removal of programs was very difficult. Under Windows, a record
is kept track of the files installed and used by programs. The
use of installation wizards helps install and remove programs, so
that when a program is removed, parts used by other programs are
left intact.</p>

<p><a name="network"></a> <a href="#start"><font size="4"><strong><img src="os09_files/up.gif" border="0" height="15" width="15"></strong></font></a><font size="4"><strong> </strong>Networking Support</font><br>
Windows supports a wide number of protocols and networks. This
allows easy connection to both Microsoft and non-Microsoft
networks.</p>

<p><strong>Internet Ready: Dial up networking and Internet
Explorer</strong><br>
Windows comes with Dial-up network support, making an Internet
connection to an Internet service provider (ISP) an easy task via
a setup wizard. In addition, under Windows, a user can configure
the dial-up networking to support more than one ISP.</p>

<p>Internet explorer is provided for users to browse the World
Wide Web. Standard FTP and Telnet programs are provided.</p>
