<H2>Intro</H2>This is a summary of the questions I got in 9 in-person interviews 
with 5 companies and about 10 phone screens 8/02-11/02. The interviews were 
pretty evenly split between very large, large, and startup-sized tech companies.
<P>The good news is that interview question repertoire is generally very 
limited. The <A 
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=maxnoycom-20&amp;path=tg/detail/-/0471383562">Programming 
Interviews Exposed</A> book covered or helped on probably 60-70% of questions I 
got. Well worth the $20. 
<H2>Linked Lists</H2>This is an extremely popular topic. I've had linked lists 
on every interview.<BR>You <B>must</B> be able to produce simple clean linked 
list implementations quickly.<BR>
<UL>
  <LI>Implement <CODE>Insert</CODE> and <CODE>Delete</CODE> for 
  <UL>
    <LI>singly-linked linked list 
    <LI>sorted linked list 
    <LI>circular linked list </LI></UL><BR><CODE>int Insert(node** head, int 
  data)</CODE><BR><CODE>int Delete(node** head, int deleteMe)</CODE>
  <P></P>
  <LI>Split a linked list given a pivot value<BR><CODE>void Split(node* head, 
  int pivot, node** lt, node** gt)</CODE> 
  <LI>Find if a linked list has a cycle in it. Now do it without marking nodes. 
  <LI>Find the middle of a linked list. Now do it while only going through the 
  list once. (same solution as finding cycles) </LI></UL>
<H2>Strings</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>Reverse words in a string (words are separated by one or more spaces). Now 
  do it in-place. <B>By far the most popular string question!</B> 
  <LI>Reverse a string 
  <LI>Strip whitespace from a string in-place<BR><CODE>void 
  StripWhitespace(char* szStr)</CODE> 
  <LI>Remove duplicate chars from a string ("AAA BBB" -&gt; "A B")<BR><CODE>int 
  RemoveDups(char* szStr)</CODE> 
  <LI>Find the first non-repeating character in a string:("ABCA" -&gt; B 
  )<BR><CODE>int FindFirstUnique(char* szStr)</CODE> 
  <P></P>
  <LI><I>More Advanced Topics: </I>
  <UL>
    <LI>You may be asked about using Unicode strings. What the interviewer is 
    usually looking for is: 
    <UL>
      <LI>each character will be two bytes (so, for example, char lookup table 
      you may have allocated needs to be expanded from 256 to 256 * 256 = 65536 
      elements) 
      <LI>that you would need to use wide char types (wchar_t instead of char) 
      <LI>that you would need to use wide string functions (like wprintf instead 
      of printf) </LI></UL>
    <LI>Guarding against being passed invalid string pointers or non 
    nul-terminated strings (using walking through a string and catching memory 
    exceptions </LI></UL></LI></UL>
<H2>Binary Trees</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>Implement the following functions for a binary tree: <CODE>
  <UL>
    <LI>Insert 
    <LI>PrintInOrder 
    <LI>PrintPreOrder 
    <LI>PrintPostOrder </LI></UL></CODE>
  <LI>Implement a non-recursive <CODE>PrintInOrder</CODE> </LI></UL>
<H2>Arrays</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>You are given an array with integers between 1 and 1,000,000. One integer 
  is in the array twice. How can you determine which one? Can you think of a way 
  to do it using little extra memory. 
  <LI>You are given an array with integers between 1 and 1,000,000. One integer 
  is missing. How can you determine which one? Can you think of a way to do it 
  while iterating through the array only once. Is overflow a problem in the 
  solution? Why not? 
  <LI>Returns the largest sum of contiguous integers in the array<BR>Example: if 
  the input is (-10, 2, 3, -2, 0, 5, -15), the largest sum is 8<BR><CODE>int 
  GetLargestContiguousSum(int* anData, int len)</CODE> 
  <LI>Implement <CODE>Shuffle</CODE> given an array containing a deck of cards 
  and the number of cards. Now make it O(n). 
  <LI>Return the sum two largest integers in an array<BR><CODE>int 
  SumTwoLargest(int* anData, int size)</CODE> 
  <LI>Sum n largest integers in an array of integers where every integer is 
  between 0 and 9<BR><CODE>int SumNLargest(int* anData, int size, int n)</CODE> 
  </LI></UL>
<H2>Queues</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>Implement a Queue class in C++ (which data structure to use internally? 
  why? how to notify of errors?) </LI></UL>
<H2>Other</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>Count the number of set bits in a byte/int32 (<A 
  href="http://www-db.stanford.edu/~manku/bitcount.html">7 different 
  solutions</A>) 
  <LI>Difference between heap and stack? Write a function to figure out if stack 
  grows up or down. 
  <LI>SQL query to select some rows out of a table (only because I had SQL on 
  the resume) 
  <LI>Open a file as securely as possible (assume the user is hostile -- list 
  all the nasty things that could happen and checks you would have to do to) 
  <LI>Implement a function to return a ratio from a double (ie 0.25 -&gt; 1/4). 
  The function will also take a tolerance so if toleran ce is .01 then 
  FindRatio(.24, .01) -&gt; 1/4<BR><CODE>int FindRatio(double val, double 
  tolerance, int&amp; numerator, int&amp; denominator)</CODE> </LI></UL>
<H2>Puzzles</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>You have 2 supposedly unbreakable light bulbs and a 100-floor building. 
  Using fewest possible drops, determine how much of an impact this type of 
  light bulb can withstand. (i.e. it can withstand a drop from 17th floor, but 
  breaks from the 18th).<BR>Note that the ever-popular binary search will give 
  you a worst case of 50 drops. You should be able to do it with under 20. 
  <LI>There are n gas stations positioned along a circular road. Each has a 
  limited supply of gas. You can only drive clockwise around the road. You start 
  with zero gas. Knowing how much gas you need to get from each gas station to 
  the next and how much gas you can get at each station, design an algorithm to 
  find the gas station you need to start at to get all the way around the 
  circle. 
  <LI>Out of 10 coins, one weighs less then the others. You have a scale. 
  <UL>
    <LI>How can you determine which one weighs less in 3 weighs? 
    <LI>Now how would you do it if you didn't know if the odd coin weighs less 
    or more? </LI></UL>
  <LI>What is the next line in the following 
  sequence:<BR><CODE>1<BR>11<BR>21<BR>Answer: it's 1211 and the next is 111221 
  </CODE></LI></UL>
<H2>Design Questions</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>How would you design a server that has to process a fair number of good 
  number of requests a second. What if you didn't know how many requests you'd 
  be getting? What if requests had different priorities? (I always think of the 
  <A 
  href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/mod/prefork.html#how-it-works">Apache 
  design</A> for this question) 
  <LI>Design <CODE>malloc</CODE> and <CODE>free</CODE>. (give up? see <A 
  href="http://g.oswego.edu/dl/html/malloc.html">how G++ malloc works</A> or <A 
  href="http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~zorn/Malloc.html">this page for more 
  examples</A>) 
  <LI>Design an elevator control system. Don't forget buttons on every floor and 
  supporting multiple elevators. (What objects/methods/properties/how components 
  communicate) 
  <LI>Design a chess game (what objects? what methods? which data where? how 
  will it work?) 
  <LI>Design a deck of cards class (object/methods/data) 
  <LI>How would you design the infrastructure front half of a very large web 
  ecommerce site? what if it was very personalized? (how sessions are handled? 
  where and what you can cache? how to load-balance?) <!-- Design a function to return the flight time given the departure and arrival times and airports of a flight in local times of respective airports. Don't forget that daylight savings time is done differently (and sometimes not at all) in different locals. --!></LI></UL>
<H2>Concurrency</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>Difference between Mutexes and Critical Sections? 
  <LI>What are Reentrant Locks? Implement a Reentrant Lock with Mutexes. 
  <LI>Implement a thread-safe class that will read/write to/from a 
  buffer<BR><CODE>TSBuffer::TSBuffer(int size)</CODE><BR><CODE>int 
  TSBuffer::Read(char* buff, int max_size)</CODE><BR><CODE>int 
  TSBuffer::Write(char* buff, int size)</CODE> </LI></UL>
<H2>Windows-specific Questions</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>What is the IUnknown COM interface? 
  <LI>Synchronization primitives available in Windows (see <A 
  href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dllproc/base/synchronization.asp">MSDN 
  documentation</A>) 
  <LI>Basic structure of a Win32 program (WinMain, Message processing) </LI></UL>
<H2>Networking</H2>I got most of these because I have a lot of networking on my 
resume. 
<UL>
  <LI>Difference between TCP and UDP? When would you want to use one over the 
  other? 
  <LI>How would approach guaging performance of webpages/parts on a very large 
  website? 
  <LI>Questions you are unlikely to get unless you claim a lot of IP experience 
  <UL>
    <LI>How does traceroute work? 
    <LI>How does path MTU discovery work? 
    <LI>How can one poison a BGP peer? </LI></UL></LI></UL>
<H2>Non-Technical Questions</H2>All of the following are very common. It's best 
to have canned answers. 
<UL>
  <LI>What do you want to do? 
  <LI>Describe your perfect job? 
  <LI>How did your interview go? How did you like the group you interviewed 
  with? 
  <LI>Rate your C++ proficiency on the scale of 1 to 10. 
  <LI>What have you been up to since you were laid off or finished school? 
  <LI>Why do you want to work at X? 
  <LI>What reservations do you have working at X? 
  <LI>Do you like working alone or in a group? 
  <LI>Discuss your greatest accomplishment over the last couple years. 
  <LI>Discuss one big problem you solved in a work/school project. 
  <LI>How do you handle conflict in a group?
