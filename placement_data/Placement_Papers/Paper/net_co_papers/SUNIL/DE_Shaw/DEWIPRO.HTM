 ---------------------------
                         SECTION-A

  you should write the programs for the following problems in C.

  1. swapping two variables x,y without using a temporary variable.
  2. a program has been given asking to find the output
         ans. it is algorithm for finding G.C.D
  3. write a program for reversing the given string.
  4. the integers from 1 to n are stored in an array in a random
     fashion. but one integer is missing. write a program to find the
     missing integer.
         ans. idea. the sum of n natural numbers is = n(n+1)/2.
              if we subtract the above sum from the sum of all the
              numbers in the array , the result is nothing but the
              missing number.
  5. some bit type of questions has been given on pointers asking to
     to find whether it is correct from syntax point of view. and if
     it is correct explain what it will do.(around 15 bits).

                         SECTION-B

    ANSWER AS MANY AS POSSIBLE.

  6.& 7. two programs on pre-processor directions has been given asking
         to find the output.
  8. simple question given on pointer
     a) kernighan & richie page no. 122
     b) schaum series  page no. 323
     try to understand the pointer problems given here he asked to explain
     in the interview if answer it in exam.
  9. write a c program to find whether a stack is progressing in forward
    or reverse direction.
  10. write a c program that reverses the linked list.

   GUIDELINES:
      the interview is very tough he is asking to do the problems in
    front of him. he is also giving some new problems to solve before him.
    you should have a very good funda of C language.
   From iit-kgp only two 2 students have been selected.

 PART --A
 ------------------------------------------------------
 1) abcD+abcd+aBCd+aBCD
    then the simplified function is
    ( Capital letters are copliments of corresponding letters
      A=compliment of a)

   [a] a   [b] ab  [c] abc  [d] a(bc)* [e] mone
   (bc)*=compliment of bc

   Ans:  e

 -------------------------------------
 2) A 12 address lines maps to the memory of

  [a] 1k bytes  [b] 0.5k bytes [c] 2k bytes  [d] none

  Ans: b

 ----------------------------------------
 3) In a processor these are 120 instructions . Bits needed to impliment
    this instructions
    [a] 6  [b] 7  [c] 10  [d] none

   Ans: b

 -----------------------------------------
 4) In 8085 microprocessor READY signal does.which of the following
    is incorrect statements
    [a]It is input to the microprocessor
    [b] It sequences the instructions

   Ans : b
 ----------------------------------------

 5) Return address will be returned by function to
   [a] Pushes to the stack by call
   Ans : a
 ------------------------------------------
 6)
    n=7623
    {
         temp=n/10;
         result=temp*10+ result;
        n=n/10
    }

 Ans : 3267
 ----------------------------------------------
 7) If AB then
       F=F(G);
    else BC then
       F=G(G);
    in this , for 75% times AB and 25% times BC then,is 10000 instructions
    are there ,then the ratio of F to G
    [a] 7500:2500  [b]  7500:625  [c] 7500:625 if a=b=c else
                                      7500:2500
 --------------------------------------------------
 8) In a compiler there is 36 bit for a word and to store a character 8bits are
 needed. IN this to store
  a character two words are appended .Then for storing a K characters string,
  How many words are needed.
  [a] 2k/9  [b] (2k+8)/9  [c]  (k+8)/9 [d] 2*(k+8)/9 [e] none

  Ans: a
 ---------------------------------------------------------
 9) C program code

    int zap(int n)
    {
     if(n<=1)then zap=1;
     else  zap=zap(n-3)+zap(n-1);
    }
    then the call zap(6) gives the values of zap
    [a] 8  [b]  9  [c] 6  [d]  12  [e] 15

   Ans: b
 ---------------------------------------------------------------

 PART-B
