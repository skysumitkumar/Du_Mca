Daewoo have changed their pattern, now the paper is relatively easy. 
30 min -  {	10 Q on C	( 3-4 Simple Q on C++ included)
		10 Q on networking
		10 Q on Unix.
	}

15 min -  {
		15 Q on Apti.
	}

Details 'll send you later along with Q's( i have to ask others because after giving 4 papers every thing is intermingled). but on thing is for sure for clearing Daewoo C should be clear, networks you will manage   but Unix was  all internals many were transmitted overhead. Infact Unix makes the difference in most of the papers.

Questions of ORP (now Lagato systems)

Main emphasis on:
1)C, C++: questions of good level(15 Questions)
2) Unix:
*questions on internals like signals
              * system call like fork
               *kernel and user mode
                *15 questions
3)General computer science
  *15 questions
  *1 question on TOC(parser)
   *Networks-UDP,X.25
  *1 question on file allocation of small file-indexed not suitable (over head)

In all if you do well in UNIX and apti you can easily clear written
Next is GD elimination round after which is the interview.Be strong with your topic of interest and that is not highly technical.But they ask about C++ and networking,because this is what they work with.

Total Time   30 mins for 45 apti questions
                     60 mins for 45 technical questions

Some questions like:

1) The system call that never returns.
2) Fork return to:
Parent
       Child
       Sibling
3)Questions related to parser
4)About Daemon process
5)A->(has instance of)B->(has instance of)C
 what is the sequence of calling of constructer and destructer.

Class name
{
static int I;
show ( )
{
cout<<name::;
{
name ( )
{

print j("j=----"i.d",sqr( j );
}

Q One question of complicated declaration.

1)Max points of intersection of two circles with equal radii
2) No of triangles in a figure(Do questions fron RS Aggarwal,Verbal and non verbal,,Annalytical reasoning CH-7,Example-6 page-61)

3)Man covered 75% of distance with vel V in time t,what is the time required for rest of the distance at speed w.
4)There are three different coloured balls,2 each,what is min no to be pulled out to assure having balls of all colours.

6)Antonymns:-3 were asked-alleviate,placate,attretion
7)Synonyms:-3 were asked-ignonymus.

Sentences of
1)-----either ------- are/is
2)  among/between two of them,he is better.
(4 questions of this type were asked)
Suitable form of sentences(4 questions of this type were asked)

Data Sufficiency:-
No of voters a)% of male voters
                      b)% of female voters

Value of x and y
(a) x-y=3
(b) 3x-3y=9

                                      SECTION-A

               you should write the programs for the following problems in C.

               1. swapping two variables x,y without using a temporary variable.
               2. a program has been given asking to find the output
                      ans. it is algorithm for finding G.C.D
               3. write a program for reversing the given string.
               4. the integers from 1 to n are stored in an array in a random
                  fashion. but one integer is missing. write a program to find the
                  missing integer.
                      ans. idea. the sum of n natural numbers is = n(n+1)/2.
                           if we subtract the above sum from the sum of all the
                           numbers in the array , the result is nothing but the
                           missing number.
               5. some bit type of questions has been given on pointers asking to
                  to find whether it is correct from syntax point of view. and if
                  it is correct explain what it will do.(around 15 bits).

                                      SECTION-B

                 ANSWER AS MANY AS POSSIBLE.

               6.& 7. two programs on pre-processor directions has been given asking
                      to find the output.
               8. simple question given on pointer
                  a) kernighan & richie page no. 122
                  b) schaum series  page no. 323
                  try to understand the pointer problems given here he asked to explain
                  in the interview if answer it in exam.
               9. write a c program to find whether a stack is progressing in forward   or
               reverse direction.
               10. write a c program that reverses the linked list.

                GUIDELINES:
                   the interview is very tough he is asking to do the problems in
                 front of him. he is also giving some new problems to solve before him.
                 you should have a very good funda of C language.
                From iit-kgp only two 2 students have been selected.

               HONEYWELL :
               ----------

               Honeywell conducted a test in IIT and Interview was in their
               office at B'lore.

               Test contained 100 multiple choice questions divided into

                              a) Verbal ability  (15 ques)
                              b) Numerical aptitude (15 )
                              c) Logical and analytical ability (15)
                              d) Elementary computer science (10)
                              d) Programming langauages (20)
                              e) Operatins systems and Data structures (25)

               Not sure about the number of questions.

               Verbal ability questions contained 3 parts. 
               a) One passage is given and U have to answer 5 questions
               b) Some words are given and their synonyms have to be written
               c) 

               Numerical aptitude and Logical questions were the usual stuff.
               ---------------------------------------------------------------
               I had 4 rounds of interview.
               First round (around 45 minutes) contained, questions from Real-time
               -----------
               Systems (my research area), operating systems and Software Engineering

               Explain U'r research work.

               What is a Real-Time System ?
               What is the difference between Hard and Soft real-time systems ?
               What is a mission critical system ?
               What is the important aspect of a real-time system ?

               Explain the difference between microkernel and macro kernel.
               Give an example of microkernel.
               Why paging is used ?
               Which is the best page replacement algo and Why ?

               WHat is software life cycle ?
               How much time is spent usually in each phases  and why ?
               Which one do U want to work if selected in Honeywell ?
               ( I said I don't like testing )
               They asked why ? 
               I said it is a boring job. Then they tried to analyse
               the knowledge in testing.

               What is testing ?
               Which are the different types of testing ?
               Then they explained the way they do testing. They said that they are
               doing testing in requirement phase and design phase so that if any
               problem comes in those phases it is not ncecessary to go back and change
               the requirement or design. All the test processing is automated.

               Why do U want to join Honeywell ?
               Ans : To get a practical feeling of Real-time systems. 

               Do U know C++ ?
               How good are U in C and C++ ?

               Second round (around 45 minutes ) 
               ------------
               They wanted a bio-data at the time of inteview. I gave the placement
               office bio-data and in that one there was column 'Major subjects
               studied'. Many of the questions came from those.

               Explain U'r research work.
               Lot of questions from it.

                      Towards the middle questions are easy than from the front. 
                      eg.  Product of three consecutive nos. 210.  What is the sum
                              of two least numbers?
                              ans.: 5 * 6 * 7 = 210 , sum = 11 is answer

                      eg.  If the area of the sqaure is increased by 69 % how
                              much the length of the side will increase?

                                ans.: 13 (i think)
                      eg.  if the sum of five consecutive nos. 35? how many prime nos
                              are there :
                               
                              ans: 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 35  so two primes

                      eg.  if the length of the rectangle is reduced by 20% and breath
                              is increased by 20 % what is the net change ?

               First he walks one mile east then half mile to north.   Then  1/4 
               mile to west, then 1/8 mile to south and so  on  making a  loop. 
               Finally hoe far he is from his camp and in which direction.
               ans: in north and south directions 
                 1/2 - 1/8 + 1/32 - 1/128 + 1/512 - and so on 
                              = 1/2/((1-(-1/4))

                first : I have three childern. Thew pproduct of their ages is  36 
               .  If you sum their ages . it is exactly same as  my neighbour's 
               door number on my left. The  sacond  mathematiciaan  verfies  the 
               door number and says that the not sufficient  .  Then  the  first 
               says " o.k one more clue is that my youngest is the youngest"
               Immmediately the second mathematician answers . Can  you  aanswer 
               the questoion asked by the first mathematician?
               What are the childeren ages?        ans  2 and 3 and 6

               THIS FILE CONTAINS THE QUESTIONS WHICH MS SCHOLARS FACED IN PLACEMENT
                                 INTERVIEWS IN 1994 AND 1995



               Name: Biswajit Sain

               for(int i = 1; i <= 1; i++)
               {
                      Company name: Wipro Infotech Ltd., Bangalore.
                      Year: 1995

               Wipinfo has 2 rounds of interviews. The first round is fully technical.
               The second round, depending on the members of the board, may be
               technical,
               semi-technical or personal. Last year the second round was more technical
               than the first(!) and the board was headed by Mr. P.V.Sanjeeva
               Reddy, one of the no-nonsense, hardcore-technical, project leaders
               in Infotech. This year it was headed by Mr. Victor Jayakiran, G.M.
               (Technical, Global R&D) who was a much sober man and therefore spent
               most of the time in the second round dealing with personal questions.

               I detail here the technical questions asked in the first round --
               --------------------------------------------------------------

               [1] Tell us about your work in brief.
               My Ans. Mention first the title, followed by a brief overview of the
               work, what we plan to achieve, what has been achieved so far, finally
               the relevance/scope of the work to the related area (i.e. how is it
               going to be useful).    [ 5-10 mins. depending on interest of the
               listener.]

               [2..n] Questions related to the work.
               Ans. Area dependent. [ ~ 10 mins ]

               [n+1] Tell us what you know about DMA and why that is needed?
               My Ans. As usual, mentioned the wastage of CPU computation power spent
               in busy-waiting. Told how DMA works.

               [n+2] What are the various types of scheduling algo, what is used by
               UNIX?
               My Ans. Mentioned Round Robin, First-come-first-served,
               Shortest-job-first, Earliest-deadline-first, Least-laxity-first,
               Priority-based-event-driven. UNIX uses RR with multi-level feedback.

               [n+3] How can you implement SJF in UNIX?
               My Ans. Usually, SJF means that we know the job-duration in advance. In
               UNIX where we cannot know that, we have to make assumptions about that
               based on which we should initially schedule. Periodically however, we
               have to fine-tune our initial assumptions based on the times taken by
               various ready jobs, and recompute estimates and change the schedule
               accordingly.

               [n+4] Different types of subroutine calling conventions?
               My Ans. Call by value, reference, value-result.

               [n+5] Parameter passing sequence used by C?
               My Ans. Rightmost parameter pushed first on stack.

               [n+6] What is a page-fault and how is it handled in UNIX?
               My Ans. [Refer to MJBach, Ch. 9 for details].

               Personal questions in the first round --
               -------------------------------------

               1. What was your overall position in the Univ. in B.E.
               2. Why did you choose to join MS here. 3. How do you like the MS course.
               4. Anything you want to know about us.

               Technical Questions in the second round --
               ---------------------------------------

               [1] What are the current trends and areas of focus in IT.
               My Ans. Talked about emerging trends of S/W Engg and ISO 9000 stuff
               (gave vague ideas about them as I don't know much nor do I care 
               about these topics myself ;-)). Then mentioned the proliferation of O-O
               methodologies and their usefulness in speeding up development process,
               code re-usability, ease of maintenance, ease of bug-fixing.
               Thirdly, mentioned the work going on in High-Speed N/w - FDDI, ATM,
               Fast-Ethernet(100Mbps). Told whatever little I knew about ATM in
               response to another question.

               [2] What is a Micro-Kernel architecture.
               My Ans. This is a developing area in OSs where  instead of building the
               kernel as a single monolithic structure starting from scratch, it is
               built as a set of layers. The micro-kernel provides only the bare-bones
               like Device-drivers, rudimentary filesystem support etc. on which,
               depending on the intended area of application of the OS, it can be
               customized to provide various higher level OS features like
               Multiprocessing, IPC, etc. 

               Personal Questions in the second round --
               --------------------------------------

               1. Tell us about yourself, your background.
               2. What does your father do currently.
               3. Your performance in schooling, B.E.
               4. Your +/- points.
               5. Why do you think Wipro should take you.
               6. What qualities do you have that make you a person suitable for going
               into the IT industry (a corollary to the previous question).
               7. What do your friends opine about you.
               8. When do you think you will complete and be able to join.
               9. How can you assure that you will join by that time.
               10. Anything you want to know about us.

               Name: G.Kartik
               Year: 1995

               Company name: Wipro Infotech

                 FIRST INTERVIEW:(First the interviewer asked me to name two 
                                  favorite subjects - OS and Networks)
                 a) Describe the memory management policies in Unix. How is paging
                    implemented? How page faults are handled? 
                    Seems to be a favorite question for these chaps ---- Maurice Bach. 
                 
                 b) Write a macro in C for swapping two nibbles in a byte.
                    -Use the shift operators and be careful while defining temporary 
                    variables( if you do so) as you have to write a macro. Otherwise
                    it is pretty simple.

                 c) What is the CPU-scheduling policy in Unix? - Round robin scheduling
                    with multilevel queues.

                 d) Diffrence between short term, long term and medium term scheduler.
                    -First two should be peaceful. The last one is also known as 
                     swapper. (See Taenenbaum and/or Peterson)

                 e) Name various page-replacement policies. Which can be implemented
                    both with and without pre-emption? - see Peterson.

                 f) Describe the Sliding window protocol. What is it's advantage
                    over stop-and-wait? - Saves bandwidth. (Taenenbaum please)


                 2ND INTERVIEW (Both personal and technical interleaved)
                 a) Tell us something about yourself.
                 b) Aren't you going for higher studies abroad? Why?
                 c) Rank and CGPA. MSites do not have ranks but still they wanted to
                    know my approx position in my batch. 
                    - Shady question. It is your job to convince them that for      MS,
               grades do not hold any meaning.

                 d) What is re-entrant code? --- Non-self modifying code. Can be 
                    shared by many processes simultaneously. Gave e.g. of text-editors
                    like 'vi'.
                    Counter Q: But then no code modifies itself. What does 'non-self 
                    modifying' mean? ---- I don't know for sure.

                 e) Diff between compilers and interpreters. Some fundaes about
                    how to link code in  different files. 

                 f) What would your friends tell us about you if we ask them?
                    Standard question for everyone.



               Company: Motorola (came in August'95)
               Just one question: When do you expect to finish? ---By August'96
                                 That is too late. We are looking for guys who
                                 finish by Jan'96. Pl. apply a month before you 
                                 submit your thesis. Thank you very much. 

               Company: HCL-HP
               Written test:
               One GRE type anals. section, and two comp Sc. sections. One Comp Sc. 
               section was problem solving type. Quite easy. Only question worth
               mentioning
               in it was:
                  You are given a stack on which you can do the following:

                  Push X ----push the contents of memory location X on the stack
                  Pop X  ----pop the contents of top of stack into mem. loc X
                  AND    ----pop top two elements of stack, AND them and push the
                             result onto stack.
                  NOR    ----pop top two elements, NOR them and push the result onto
               stack.

               Given two data elements at memory locations A and B, obtain A XOR B using 
               the above.

               First Interview:- mostly technical.

                      a) Asked about my B.E. and why I joined MS.

                      b) My preference of posting. They asked this initially before
                         launching into any other questions. I told them Madras.
                         Remainder of the interview was mostly on OS and C. Nothing
                         on networks. Thus I have this inkling that they frame their 
                         questions on the basis of what you specify as your preference 
                         of posting and  depending on what projects are available there.

                      c) What architectures, apart from 8085, do you know? --- Nothing 
                         very deep and I told them as much. 
                      d) Give the contents of process stack for the execution of 
                         a particular C-program they give. 
                         ------ The C-program as such is not important. You just have 
                         to remember the order in which the return address of any 
                         function/procedure call, the parameters, and the local variables
                         are stored on the stack. 
                         ( I guess, any CO book should have this. Maurice Bach talks 
                         about user and kernel stacks)

                      e) What all are shared by parent and child processes immediately
                         after parent executes a fork system call? Cross questioned
                         about the 'copy on write' facility and 'dup' system call. 
                         --- again see MB, and also Stevens' 2nd chapter.

                      f) What events happen when the following command is given?
                              cat /etc/passwd | more 

                         ---- Describe how the shell forks the two processes and how
                              the pipe gets created between them. 
                        Cross question: How does 'cat' know that its output has to be 
                                        written into the pipe and not into standard o/p?
                                        

                      g) Have you written any TSR's? --- No.
                         What are TSR? ----Terminate but stay resident programs.
                         Then does it mean DOS is a multitasking system? 
                         ---- No, TSRs are interrupt driven

                      h) How are Windows programs different from normal C-programs?
                         ---- Windows programs are event driven.
                         What can be the various types of events? --- See Primer/API
               bible.

                      i) Difference between swapping and paging. 
                         ---- Swapping is moving entire processes between main memory
                         and hard disk. Paging is moving individual pages of a process.
                         
                      j) Write a program to list all palindromes in a string.
                         ----- Hint: use a stack and some extra storage for remembering
                         previous palindromes.

                      k) What's the outout?

                              char *cp;
                              int *ip;

                              cp=(char *)0x100;
                              ip=(int *)cp;

                              ip++;
                              cp++;
                              printf("cp = %x ip = %x", cp, ip);

                              Ans:cp = 0x101 ip = 0x102 ...(why?)

                      l) What are static variables and functions? There are two files,
                         say, file1 and file2. file1 has a global declaration
                                      static int x;
                        file2 has a global declaration
                                      int y;
                        What is the difference between the two types of declarations
                        when you link file1 and file2? 
                        --- x is local to functions in file1 and cannot be seen by  
                            functions in file2. y can be seen by functions in both 
                            file1 and file2. 
                      m) How does a debugger set breakpoints in a code you are debugging?
                         ---- some funda regarding insertion if an interrupt instruction
                              in the code....don't know for sure.
                        (It seems that this q was also asked by some other company.
                         Worth knowing the answer.)

               This was followed by a shady psychological test. You are given a 
               set of six pictures. Look at each picture and write a story on each.

               Second interview: (fully personal) --- This was more interesting;-)
                      a) What did you feel about the ppt? --- wasn't very impressive
                        so gave some shady answer.
                      b) Have you heard of creativity? -- Ya.
                         Have you heard of Bernard Shaw? -- Ya.
                         (Then he rattled off some quote of BS regarding creativity)
                         What do you say? --- I put some shadiest fundaes regarding
                         visionaries and Leonardo da Vinci conceptualising Helicopters
                         in his time!

                      1. Assume a long linked list. Some nodes instead of pointing to
                      their next node, point backwards. This is called a corrupted node.
                      Give an algo in C to test whether a list is corrupted or not.
                      No extra space in nodes, in efficient time. less memory. marks a
                      function of time and storage used.
                     2. A macro to test whether a number is a power of 2.
                      3. There is a two-dimensional linked list. Each node has a, North,
                      South, West, East pointers. Write fragment of C Code to do some
                      interchanging stuffs. North points to West, West point to South et
                      etc, ( A glorified version of reverse of linked list)
                      4-7. Questions like these, basically pointer stuffs
                      8 Assume there are two cubes. U can write one digit (0-9) on each
                      of these sides, Write in such a way that when u keep two cubes side
                      by side, u should be able to show all days in a month. (1-31)

               U.V.Ravindra - D.J.Ram's student. Passed out in Jan '95.
               **********************************************************************

               The first thing any IIT-ian should realize while attending Campus
               Interviews is that the Companies have come to take you, and that
               *you* are not looking for a job.  I refer to the attitude of the mind.
               Therefore, there's no need to treat it as a life and death issue.  In
               my opinion, several students take this matter as a very serious career
               issue, and think that if they don't get a job in the campus
               interviews, they are sunk.  This is not true.  A good case in point
               will be Sudhakar's, who didn't get any job that he wanted in the
               Campus Interviews, but when he came to Bangalore and applied to the
               different companies, he landed a job in *every* company he applied
               for. And these companies were by no means insignificant ones: Tata
               Elxsi, Wipro Infotech, Novell, C-DAC ... all those which are
               considered to be respectable employers.  So, the catch phrase during
               Campus Interviews is, "don't panic, be cool, relax, you have *nothing*
               to lose, and everything to gain."  This is the attitude you should
               have in mind when you go for the interviews.

               About the companies, now.  There are mainly two kinds of companies in
               Bangalore.  Those that are small, like Tata Elxsi and Novell, with a
               more or less flat organizational structure, and those that are very
               huge, like Wipro and TISL, where there's a veritable population
               explosion.  There are merits and demerits of both.  In the small
               organizations, there are fewer people, so it is easy to make your
               presence felt and to make yourself noticed, and to get proper credit
               for what you are doing.  The flip side of the coin for these
               organizations is that you have to be very careful in what you say and
               do, for everything you do/say is audible at the highest levels, and,
               as the American Police say when they are arresting a criminal
               "anything you say may be used against you."  Smaller organizations
               also have a flatter structure, so the amount of responsibility on your
               shoulders may be quite heavy. In one sense it is good -- you can
               contribute well to the organization and get credit for it, but in
               another sense it is bad, for you may have to work late and quite hard too.
                The advantages of being in a large organization like Wipro is
               that you will never be *overloaded* with work, unless you choose to do
               so yourself.  You can be in the company as you are in the CS
               Department right now, light-headed and carefree, even a bit careless.
               The obverse side of the coin here is that in such huge organizations,
               you will never be anything but small fry in a big pond ... and getting
               credit where it is due may be a little difficult (specific reference
               to TISL here). 
               Another issue that should be considered when seriously aiming at a
               company is the nature of the job that you will be put in.  In my honest
               opinion, since the pay structures of most companies are
               verisimilar now, and the salary differential between employees of
               different companies is very minimal, the nature of work is the most
               important criterion that one should pay attention to.  If you are
               specifically interested in some kinds of jobs, such as, say UNIX
               Internals/Device Drivers, Networking (Unix/DOS), or graphics,
               multimedia, etc, you should aim at companies that are primarily
               working in those areas.  Also, you should try to find out, through
               other channels, as to whether openings exist in those companies for the
               kind of job that you are aiming at.  For example, Wipro Infotech's
               communication group has no openings right now.  Most people who join
               Wipinfo are taken into the Testing/Debugging groups, or put in the
               Tandem Group.  These are pretty low down in the job priority order of
               the average computer professional in Bangalore.  Novell is working in
               DOS based networking (Netware) and is by far one of the best companies
               in Bangalore -- good salary, flat structure, nice working environment.
               Tata Elxsi is also working in Networking, but that is mainly UNIX
               based.  Other companies that work in Unix are TISL and Wipro Systems.
               Device drivers and Unix Internals are a big word in WipSys, Wipinfo
               and Elxsi.  There are other companies like Siemens Information Systems
               Ltd., Siemens Computing Services Ltd., which I am not sure of.  Texas
               Instruments is working VLSI CAD and chip design stuff.  Motorola,
               can't say.  Other companies working in Unix Internals and Networking
               are Hughes and HCL HP.  Also, some companies in Delhi are there ...

               That's about companies.  Now about the interview.  A typical interview
               panel will have one to two people from the technical cadres and a
               couple (or more) of chaps from the Human Resources division.  The
               technical guys are usually interested in grilling you on an area that
               you choose -- typically they ask you what areas are your favourites
               and then ask you questions in that.  This happens in companies like
               C-DAC, Wipro, Elxsi etc.  In  addition, they might ask you, if you say
               you like working in Unix, to select one particular area of the OS and
               ask you fundaes in that.  Therefore, prepare for all this kind of
               thing.  Read up the C-FAQ and the UNIX FAQ.  Be prepared for dumb
               questions in recursion in C and, if you know C++, some questions on
               Inheritance etc.  About UNIX, try to concentrate on some topic like
               IPC etc.  Otherwise, device drivers etc would be fine. Also, if you
               are planning to suggest networking as an area of interest, be clear
               about what the various layers of the TCP/IP stack do, where they fit in
               with respect to the OSI protocol layers, and also internals of the
               TCP or IP processes in the kernel.  If you are preparing for the
               Novell interview, there is no harm in saying that you don't know
               anything about Netware, but you have only heard about it.  However,
               say that you have good basics in TCP/IP networking, and be prepared to
               prove your statement.

               Another thing you should be prepared with is how to give an overview
               of your project/thesis topic in two-three minutes.  This is the
               typical attention span of the people who interview you, and it is
               better to try and fit in as much info as you can into the first two
               minutes of your talk about your project/thesis topic.  Also, try to
               make it as interesting as possible, and leave a few loose ends if you
               want them to ask you some questions on that, so that you can
               demonstrate your mastery over the subject.

               I really can't think of many more things to write.  Perhaps I would
               have said more if I were giving you people a talk or something like
               that.  It is more interactive that way, and more issues crop up.  Tell
               me if I can be of any more help.  Do mail back.

               Regards,

               Hi Srichie (and others),

               My boss is on leave today, and I just finished my work slightly ahead
               of schedule, so here are some answers to your questions.  Find them
               ensconced comfortably amongst the questions themselves.  For your
               convenience, I have prepended a '===>' string to each of my responses.
               [e]grep it!

               ===> Well, first of all, you, Srichie, at least, don't seem to have learnt

               Learn that these companies are *not* _DESTINED to be your DESTINY_
               ... you have the choice to make as to which one *you* want.  Learn to
               remember, always, and never forget, that the companies are coming to
               *take* you; *you* aren't dying to join them.  Learn that, it is *you*
               and not the companies who are in the commanding position.  Learn that
               you aren't in the proverbial beggar's position: you *can* choose.
               Learn that you *should, must, have to, ought to* choose.

               ===> The *PLEASE!!!!!* stinks thoroughly of insecurity.  Please
               abolish that thought from your mind forthwith!

               And finally, before I go on, be warned that this is a
               Loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong
               mail, and be prepared to spend some time with boring details of
               companies.

               All the best to all of you in all your endeavours,
               The guy with the magic (illuminating) lamp:
               Ravindra [*Alli* Baba!]

               ---------------------------------------------------------------------

               > 01. BEL, Ba. ===> Can't say anything about it, though it's about 20
               min. walk from my house. I suppose they mostly deal with VLSI CAD and
               stuff like that, which deals directly with Electronics.

               > 02. CMC, Hy.  ===> Ask J. Sriram ;-) :)  He will by far be the best
               information provider.

               > 03. Cadence Design Sys, Noida. (*)

               ===>

               A company that deals extensively with VLSI CAD.  Amongst the highest payers
               in the job market today.  When they came last year they offered
               (me!) 1.75 lakh per annum.  I, of course, spurned the offer.  The kind
               of money they offer will be good for anybody, even if they live in an
               expensive place like Delhi, where it is situated.  If you are
               interested in doing a job with *no* work (I do mean you will have to
               sit idle), which purportedly deals with VLSI CAD, join this company.
               They were really desperate for people last year:  I had given in my
               application, but had decided against joining the company, so I
               abstained from the interview.  They *rang me up at the SUNLab* to ask
               whether I would attend the interview, please.  To which, of course, I
               answered in the negative, thank you.  

               If you join this company, be prepared to meet a lot of louts from Delhi
               College of Engineering and/or Delhi Institute of Technology,
               which our own dear Kakka swears (alma) 'mater'nity by!

               Incidentally, I should warn all those who are looking at "no work +
               1.75 lakhs is a great deal," that although it is all very well in its
               appearance, having no work at office is a real killer.  I was without
               work (I mean *really* doing nothing) in Elxsi for about two months, and I
               alone know how frustrating it can get.  Be prepared to be
               frustrated in the first few months of your employment in Cadence,
               therefore.

               > 04. Computervision Res & Dev, Pune. (*)

               ===>

               This is a "wholly-owned subsidiary* of the US firm, Computer Vision,
               Inc.  The parent company commands a lot of respect in corporate
               circles.  I don't know much about them, except that they do
               proprietary research and development (the corporate name for "bug
               fixing and documentation") for the parent company.  You will *not* be
               sent abroad till you are at least 8-12 months old in the company, IF
               AT ALL.  This is the case with most multinational undertakings in
               India.

               The pay must be good.  I don't know if this is another one of those
               *workless* (worthless!) front-ends for a big body-shopping
               multinational, but from what I hear from the Pune-ites here, it isn't.
               That means it isn't a body-shopper, most probably; no comments about
               worthless :) or not.

               A big one for Graphics.  The only challenger to Silicon Graphics Inc.,
               the most powerful Graphics company in India (and the world) yet.

               Disadvantage: Location.  Pune is *not* a part of India's silicon
               valley.  Believe me, it places employees at a considerable
               disadvantage.

               > 05. DENEB Hitech, Ba. (*) ===>  Absolutely no idea about this one.
               Will try to find out, but can't assure anything.

               > 06. DBSS, Md.  ===>  Never heard of this one either.

               > 07. Frontier Info Tech, Hy. (*)  ===> Am I deaf/blind, or are new
               companies cropping up in "satellite silicon vallies" (hey! I hold the
               copyright for that phrase) like Hyderabad, Madras, Pune, etc?  I've
               never heard of this one either.

               > 08. Geometric S/w Services, Bo. (*)  ===> Boy!  I *am* in the wrong
               room, aren't I?  So many new and strange companies ...

               > 09. Hughes S/w Sys, ND.

               ===> Ask our resident dark-horse Unit Sirsiwal for details on this
               one.  Also ask him *why* he left the company.  My other friends in
               Hughes seem to be quite satisfied with it.  One of them (my classmate
               in BTech) worked there for two years.  He booked a Maruti 800, which
               is due for delivery in Feb '96; they sent him to US immediately! ;-)

               > 10. IMRL, Ba. (*)  ===>  Sounds like one of those quasi-governmental
               organizations like C-DAC, C-DOT, BEL etc.  Can't say if it *is* one of
               them or not, for this is the first I have heard of it.

               > 11. IMI S/w, Hy. (Dunno expansion of IMI) (*)

               ===>  Neither do I :-(  Looks like I'm in the wrong party now.  I'll
               have to stop and ask for directions.

               > 12. INFOSYS, Ba. ===>  The best company for non-CS people who want
               to make an entry into Software jobs.  A cousin of the dreaded TCS.
               Better than TCS.  A "no-no" for all CS BTech/upwards degree holders.
               Give it a clear berth (this is for all MS/PhD scholars).  For the
               others: prepare well for the test.  Flunk the interview.  They will
               select you.  

               For details about the test, ask Ravan.

               > 13. Info Tech Ltd, Faridabad. (*) ===> Faridabad is a factory area,
               close to Delhi, in Haryana (for all practical purposes, it can be said
               to be the Industrial Suburb of New Delhi).  I've never heard of this
               company, and it might be a good idea to check up on this before even
               attending the PPTalk.

               > 14. L&T, Bo.  ===>  A couple of my friends joined here after BTech.
               I lost all touch with them promptly.  Either L&T ate them for lunch/dinner,
               or they have just joined the ranks of those
               multitudinous Bombayites, for whom the world outside doesn't exist.
               They used to manufacture PCs.  I don't know what they do now.

               In any case, L&T would be working in Manufacturing CAD, if I am not
               mistaken.  Try it, if you are interested in MfCAD.   The pay may be
               *good*, not *excellent* and by no means *stupendous*.

               One thing about L&T.  They hold the worldwide patents for the
               "zee-pump" ... the "Z"-shaped pump that you see at the petrol bunks in
               Adyar and the one near Malar Hospital.  A great achievement.  Another
               thing about L&T.  The person who headed the zee-pump project, a guy by
               the name of Chakravarti, has quit.  He now rests in comfortable
               obscurity in the cosy arms of IIT Delhi, in his position as Assistant
               Professor, Mech. Engg. Department.

               > 15. MIEL, Ba. ===>  Sorry, can't provide data on this.  They're too
               secretive about what they do. :-) :-)

               But seriously, they work in cellular telephones and pagers and stuff
               like that.  Could be good work, but I don't know.  A good job for CS
               MTechs with an Electronics background.  At any rate, they're going to
               prefer ECE MTechs and MSs to CS chaps.  Try nonetheless.

               They pay a little less than Wipro Infotech, where the take home ranges
               close to 9k pm.

               One positive point about a Motorola job is that they offer leased
               accommodation in Bangalore.  Believe me, it's a very tangible benefit.
               They also don't seem to have any restriction on how many laser
               printouts are taken (and *what* printouts are taken) by employees.  I
               have seen people downloading pictures of Madhubala and Meena Kumari
               and taking laser printouts of them.

               Of course, you can do that in Wipro Infotech too, provided you are in
               the AT&T bug fixing project.

               > 16. NEXUS, Pondicherry. (*)  ===> Pshoo!  I thought people of
               Pondicherry were a more spiritual lot!  Aurobindo and all that.
               Remember our trip to that place? 

               Can't help feeling that I've lost myself in the woods somewhere.  Have
               to yell for help ... there's a wicked wolf gazing hungrily in my direction
               ... grandmaa .... help!!! 
               > 17. Netquest, Ba.

               ===> A company started by IBM/Microsoft defectors (dunno which one
               exactly).  It's said to have a good work culture, but can't say much about
               it.  It was established sometime last year.  DOS work.  I don't
               have much respect for DOS (indeed, I hold it in the utmost contempt).
               Therefore, I will desist from saying anything more about it, lest I
               should colour your mind with my biased opinions.

               > 18. Novell S/w Dev, Ba.

               ===> From what Sudhakar tells me, it seems to be a good company.
               However, they work mostly in DOS-based (NETWARE) networks.  As far as
               networks is concerned, a company worth putting in the Dream Job list.
               As far as Unix is concerned, they don't have much work going on.  The
               Unixware guys are treated as some sort of poor cousins of the NetWare
               guys, I am told.  The pay and perks are good.  Based on
               employee-employer trust, so you can get away with a lot of fraudulence
               in the name of overtime, house-shifting ... etc.

               Ask Sudhakar for more details.  I'm sure he will supply enough to make your
               mouth water, and your pens to rush for the dream job form. 
               > 19. ORACLE Corp, Ba.

               ===>  THIS IS THE BEST PAYER IN BANGALORE TODAY!!!!

               Yes.  And Sanjay Patil, who was porting Oracle to SCO-Unix has already
               gone to US!  A good company, but only if you are willing to condemn
               yourself to working in Oracle all your life.  They work in all aspects
               of Oracle, right from the internals (file system, concurrency control,
               etc) to the User Interface.  Quite a lot of their work is bug fixing and
               stuff, but some lucky fellows might get to do a bit of porting
               from one OS to another, which isn't as bad as it sounds, actually.

               > 20. Ramco Sys, Md.    ===> Ask somebody else.  I never thought that
               companies in Madras were worth joining, and, consequently, never
               bothered about them.

               > 21. River Run S/w(formerly Comsoft), Noida.

               ===> Said to be working in Networks.  Someone should have asked
               Shalini Agrawal what she does apart from sending mails to her friends
               in Cadence etc.  Perhaps someone from Sarayu already did that when she
               (Shalini A.) came for the Convo.

               Said to pay decently.  Which means nothing, because, being in Delhi,
               you'll still be away from the heart and soul of the computer industry,
               Bangalore. 

               BTW, my home is in Delhi, and, since I *chose* to work in Bangalore, I
               must know what I am talking about! :-)

               ===>
               All three are good companies.  I have already detailed all these in my
               earlier mail. They work in communications.

               > 25. Sonic S/w Sys, Hy. (*)

               ===>
               A company working in Systems and Networking.

               > 26. TCS, Bo. 

               ===> The avoidable giant!

               > 27. TI, Ba

               ===>  The only other company working in the same field as Cadence
               above.  All I said for Cadence holds good for it, except that the pay
               is slightly lower.  The perks are good, working conditions excellent,
               etc.  Attend the PPT.

               > 28. TISL, Ba. 

               ===> A cousin to my own organization, Tata Elxsi.  The TATA Stamp, and
               so called IBM culture.  Can't say anything much. The pay is amongst
               the highest in the Industry.  It is actually a big bodyshopper.

               > 29. VSNL, Bo.

               ===> The Government's only value-added network service provider
               company.  The pay may not be too good, considering you will be placed
               in Bombay, and you might become on of the nondescript millions who
               shuttle between one end of Bombay to the other in the dreaded local
               trains.  There may be certain perks that I don't know of.  The
               interviewers are bound to be knowledgeable, and from NCST, Bombay.
               Perhaps Dr. Ramani, the virtual head of the ERNET project may come.  A
               job whose interview I can predict will be interesting to attend.  I
               can't say much about the job itself, for I am not sure about it at
               all.

               >          &            } Ba.
               >       WIPRO SYSTEMS     } 

               I don't think there's anything to be said about these giants.  Only
               thing is, Wipro is not into the holidays business.  I firmly believe
               that joining Wipro will further your student-like life for a few more
               years, and if you are really raring to get into the corporate line of
               jobs, then Wipro is not for you.  When I say Wipro above, I mean Infotech.
                Wipro Systems is one of the more Pseud-ish companies, what
               with their formal attire, replete with Tie and associated
               appurtenances of a western lifestyle.  Both Wipro-s have a very good
               pay, and *sure-shot* revisions once a year, where you do end up
               getting at least a 20% hike, usually.  Don't quote me, however. This
               is strictly off the records.

               Novell network paper

               The paper consists os three sections.
               1. aptitude 15 questions 20 min. 2. system concepts 20 questions 20 min. 3.
               'c'   15 questions 20 min. 
               NOTE:::::

               I'm sendin the questions, somany have no answers. U do check the
               answers  for all the given questions also.

               All questions are MULTIPLE CHOICES ONLY.

               U do try to cover the related topics to get some understanding.
               In interview They are asking C C++ Operating system concepts
               and Networks.
               They will ask about Ur interesting subjects, U try to have good
               grip on those intresting subjects.

               They selected 11 out of 55 students.
               They asked about c c++ project work and OS,NETWORKS.
               But they selected only 2 , one from CS and another is BTech ECE.


               SECTION 1 is main factor selection to the interview


               --------------------------------------------------------------
               In the interveiw you should be very active .And should be frank to say 
               no also.One CS student said that he don't know NETWORK and he hasn't 
               taken NETWORKS subject.But he has selected.
                    OK  BEST OF LUCK.


               section 1::::;

               *. GRE book test paper 3 section 5

               * 5 programs are sheduled from monday to saterday, monday is not holiday,
               PQRST are the programs. Theday before P is holiday, and some other clues are
               given, we have to find the sequence (4 questions)

               ANS: tuesday is the holiday     P comes on wednesday ,
                   U can do the remaining very easily.
               * Suppose U R the presoner, There are two guards Who will tell truth or
               one will tell truth. There is a gate for liberty and another foe hell.

               Some questions are given, like
                  i. are U tell truth?
                  ii. another tell truth or not??

               permit morethan one to cross the river, what is the correct way to
               cross the river??

               * There are 7  targets, A B and C has to shoot them. All should be 
               shooted 
               consicutively.
                  1. The no. of chances for A and B are not less thn 2,
                  2. for C there is only one chance.
                  3. A can't shot 3 times consicutively.
                  4. B is permited to shoot in even chances only.

                  They have given some 3or 4 questions on this

Diagram fax kar raha hoon,question yahan likhe hai.

qus 1: There are total 9balls out of which 8 are of same weight & one is heavier than all. Find out 
the heaviest ball.

Qus 2: there are some balls  in a box colored either red or black .on the first chance you score 1 point if ball picked is red & score 3 points if ball is black .
	For all subsequent chances you score 2 points if the color of ball is same as previous ball otherwise you score no points. So find the overall score of player.

Qus 3: 10 balls in a box  either red  or  black colored are no from  1-10
	If you advance 7 times you win the game.	
	Condition for advance of game
		- ball picked is odd black.
		- Ball picked even red.
		- Ball picked is even black if previous ball was  black.
		- Ball picked  is odd red if previous ball was red


Qus 4: Program to select smallest and largest number and their respective location ( count no. ) 

Qus 5: There are 50  workers in a firm classify them among class 1,class2, class3  depending on the age salary & working years group.

CLASS	AGE 				SALARY			WORKING YEAR
1	Less than 29			up to 4000$		less than 1 year
2	29-31				4000 - 5000 		1-3 years
3	31-33				5000 - 6000 		3- 4
4								greater than 4 years (Class 4)

Qus 6: The quality of product depends on the feed , temp & pressure .
	
	(a) if the feed is changed the quality gets changed so in order to maintain the quality the temp & pressure are to be controlled until the required quality is obtained.
	(b) If quality changes from the required on its own ,then the temp & pressure controls are reset.
	
Qus 7: There is a lot of 150 products . the products are to be classified either as type A or type B or scrapped .if the number of rejected items are equal to or more than 12. There are three criteria

		Type A 						Type B

		Weight range					weight range
		Major axis					major axis
		Minor axis					minor axis

	Out of 150 pieces , sample of 15 pieces are taken at a time

                        --------------------------
dated  : June '97

The test consists of two parts
PART  A - Aptitude  ( 20 Q, 20 min)  --20*2  = 40Marks
PART  B - C Language( 20 Q, 30 min)  --20*3  = 60Marks
No negative marking

PART  A:
        There is no need to be worried about aptitude part, the standard of 
        questions is not so high; butthe only thing is that the time may not 
        be sufficient. Prepare from GRE & GMAT. This PART A consists of 
        questions on numarical ability and analytical ability.Be careful about 
        one particular set of questions shown below

        ** Suppose that the following meanings are given to various operators
        +   =  not less than
        -   =  greater than
        %   =  addition
        >   =  subtraction    ( totally there are six like this)

        Q)  The expression  a%b-c>d  does not imply
                a)    b)    c)    d)

                These alternatives also were in similar symbolic form. So you 
                will have to decode them also, along with the one given in 
                the question. There were 4 questions of this type. They are 
                not difficult but the need time. I could answer only 17 from 
                this section in the given time, all of which are correct.

 PART  B

 In this section, there was lot of emphasis on structures and macros.We could
 recall only 12 or 13 questions out of 20. All the questions were of multiple
 choices, which we don't remember for most questions.

 Q 1)  typedef struct {
                char * ;
                nodeptr NEXT ;
                } *nodeptr;
                What does nodeptr stand for?

 Q 2)  Supposing that each integer occupies 4 bytes and each character 1 byte,
       what is the output of the following program ?

       main()
       {
        int a[] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7};
        char c[] = {a,s,h,o,k};
        printf("%d  %d",&a[3] - &a[0], &c[3] - &c[0]);
       }
       ANS : 3  3

 Q 3)  What is the output of the program?

        main()
        {
                struct s1 { int i;}
                struct s2 {int i;}
                struct s1 st1;
                struct s2 st2;
                st1.i = 5;
                st2 = st1;
                printf("%d", st2.i);
        }

 Q 4)  What is the output of the program?
        main()
        {
                int i,j;
                int mat[3][3] = { 1 2 3
                                  4 5 6
                                  7 8 9};
                for(i=2;i>=0;i--)
                {       
                        for(j=2;j>=0;j--)
                        printf("%d", *(*(mat+j)+i));
                }
        }

 Q 5)  fn(n)
       {
        int i;
        for(i=0;i<=n;i++)
          fn(n-i);
          printf("Well done!");
       }

       How many times is the printf statement executed for n=10

 Q 6)   What is the output of the program?
 
        main()
        {
          struct emp{
                        char emp[];
                        int empno;
                        float sal;
                        };
          struct emp member = { "TIGER" };
          printf("%d  %f", member.empno, member.sal);
        }

 Q 7)  O/P of the program

        #define infiniteloop while(1)
        main()
        {
                infiniteloop;
                printf("DONE");
        }
 Q 8)  O/P of the program?
        main()
        {
                int a=2, b=3;
                printf("%d", a+++b);
        }
 Q 9) O/P of the program?
        #define prn(a)    printf("%d", a);
        #define print(a,b,c)    prn(a),prn(b),prn(c)
        #define max(a,b)    (a<b)?b:a
        main(0
        {
                int x=1, y=2;
                print(max(x++,y),x,y);
                print(max(x++,y),x,y);
        }

 Q 10)  Which of the following is the correct declaration for 
        the function main()
        ANS : main(int,char *[])
 Q 11)  If 'ptr' is defined as,
        int *ptr[][100];
        which of the following correctly allocates memory for ptr?
        ANS :  ptr = (int *)(malloc(sizeof(int)*100));

 Q 12) I don't remember this program exactly. Anyway, I will give the answer
        #define  ....   /* A macro is defined interms of K  */
        main()
        {
                int K=2;
                printf("%d",2*(K+3.14));
        }

7. copernicus is the intelligent. In the days of copernicus the trans ð73 port  and  technology development was less & it took  place  weeks  to 
comunicate  a  message at that time.  wherein we can send  it  through 
satellite  with in no time ----------.  even with this  fast  develop
ments  it  has become difficult to understand each other.   

1> people were not intelligent during Copernicus days (f).  
2>  Transport  facilities are very much improved in noe a  days  (can' 
say) 	 
3>  Even with the fast developments of the techonology we  can't  live 
happily.(can't say)
4>  We  can understand the people very much with  the  development  of 
communication(f).

Q8)  senior managers warned the workers that because of the  intfoduc
tors  of japanese industry in the car market. There is the  threat  to 
the workers.
      

	 
They  also said that there will be the reduction in the  purchase 
of  the sales of car in public.the interest rates of the car  will  be 
increased with the loss in demand.

    1> japanese workers are taking over the jobs of indian industry.(false)
    2> managers said car interests will go down after seeing the raise 
in interest rates.(true)
    3> japanese investments are ceasing to end in the car industry.(false)
    4> people are very much interested to buy the cars.(false)

Q9) In the totalitariturican days,the words have very much devalued.In 
the  present day,they are becoming domestic that is the words will  be 
much more devalued.  In that days, the words will be very much effect
ed  in political area.  but at present,the words came very  cheap  .we 
can say they come free at cost.

     1> totalitarian society words are devalued.(false)
     2> totalitarian will have to come much about words(t)
     3> The art totalitatian society the words are used for the polit
ical speeches.

Q10)  There should be copyright for all arts. The reele has came  that 
all  the arts has come under one copy right society,they were use  the 
money  that come from the arts for the developments . There may  be  a 
lot  of  money  will come from the Tagore works. We have  to  ask  the 
benifiters from Tagore work to help for the development of his works.

     1> Tagore works are came under this copy right rule.(f)
     2>  People  are  free to go to the  because  of  the  copy  right 
rule.(can't say)

The test consists of two parts
PART  A - Aptitude  ( 20 Q, 20 min)  --20*2  = 40Marks
PART  B - C Language( 20 Q, 30 min)  --20*3  = 60Marks
No negative marking

PART  A:
        There is no need to be worried about aptitude part, the standard of 
        questions is not so high; butthe only thing is that the time may not 
        be sufficient. Prepare from GRE & GMAT. This PART A consists of 
        questions on numarical ability and analytical ability.Be careful about 
        one particular set of questions shown below

        ** Suppose that the following meanings are given to various operators
        +   =  not less than
        -   =  greater than
        %   =  addition
        >   =  subtraction    ( totally there are six like this)

        Q)  The expression  a%b-c>d  does not imply
                a)    b)    c)    d)

                These alternatives also were in similar symbolic form. So you 
                will have to decode them also, along with the one given in 
                the question. There were 4 questions of this type. They are 
                not difficult but the need time. I could answer only 17 from 
                this section in the given time, all of which are correct.

 PART  B

 In this section, there was lot of emphasis on structures and macros.We could
 recall only 12 or 13 questions out of 20. All the questions were of multiple
 choices, which we don't remember for most questions.

 Q 1)  typedef struct {
                char * ;
                nodeptr NEXT ;
                } *nodeptr;
                What does nodeptr stand for?

 Q 2)  Supposing that each integer occupies 4 bytes and each character 1 byte,
       what is the output of the following program ?

       main()
       {
        int a[] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7};
        char c[] = {a,s,h,o,k};
        printf("%d  %d",&a[3] - &a[0], &c[3] - &c[0]);
       }
       ANS : 3  3

                struct s1 st1;
                struct s2 st2;
                st1.i = 5;
                st2 = st1;
                printf("%d", st2.i);
        }

 Q 4)  What is the output of the program?

                                  4 5 6
                                  7 8 9};
                for(i=2;i>=0;i--)
                {       
                        for(j=2;j>=0;j--)
                        printf("%d", *(*(mat+j)+i));
                }
        }

 Q 5)  fn(n)
       {
        int i;
        for(i=0;i<=n;i++)
          fn(n-i);
          printf("Well done!");
       }

       How many times is the printf statement executed for n=10

                        float sal;
                        };
          struct emp member = { "TIGER" };
          printf("%d  %f", member.empno, member.sal);
        }

 Q 7)  O/P of the program

                infiniteloop;
                printf("DONE");
        }
 Q 8)  O/P of the program?
        main()
        {

        main(0
        {
                int x=1, y=2;
                print(max(x++,y),x,y);
                print(max(x++,y),x,y);
        }

 Q)  Strike off any digit from each number in seven rows (need not
 be at same place) and combine the same operations with 3 digit numbers
 to get the same addition. After this strike off another digit from all
 and add all the No.s to get the same 2 digit No. perform the same
 process again with 1 digit No.s. Give the ' no.s in 7 rows at
 each stage.

3) there is a safe with a 5 digit No. The 4th digit is 4 greater than
second digit, while 3rd digit is 3 less than 2nd digit. The 1st digit
is thrice the last digit. There are 3 pairs whose sum is 11. Find

Date: July 1997
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This paper have two sections
each paper contains 10 questions each.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) abcD+abcd+aBCd+aBCD
   then the simplified function is
   ( Capital letters are copliments of corresponding letters
     A=compliment of a)
  [a] a   [b] ab  [c] abc  [d] a(bc)* [e] mone
  (bc)*=compliment of bc
  Ans:  e
2) A 12 address lines maps to the memory of
 [a] 1k bytes  [b] 0.5k bytes [c] 2k bytes  [d] none
 Ans: b
3) In a processor these are 120 instructions . Bits needed to impliment
   this instructions

7) If A>B then
      F=F(G);
   else B>C then
      F=G(G);
   in this , for 75% times A>B and 25% times B>C then,is 10000 instructions
   are there ,then the ratio of F to G

The test consists of two parts
PART  A - Aptitude  ( 20 Q, 20 min)  --20*2  = 40Marks
PART  B - C Language( 20 Q, 30 min)  --20*3  = 60Marks
No negative marking

PART  A:
        There is no need to be worried about aptitude part, the standard of 
        questions is not so high; butthe only thing is that the time may not 
        be sufficient. Prepare from GRE & GMAT. This PART A consists of 
        questions on numarical ability and analytical ability.Be careful about 
        one particular set of questions shown below

        ** Suppose that the following meanings are given to various operators
        +   =  not less than
        -   =  greater than
        %   =  addition
        >   =  subtraction    ( totally there are six like this)

        Q)  The expression  a%b-c>d  does not imply
                a)    b)    c)    d)

                These alternatives also were in similar symbolic form. So you 
                will have to decode them also, along with the one given in 
                the question. There were 4 questions of this type. They are 
                not difficult but the need time. I could answer only 17 from 
                this section in the given time, all of which are correct.

 PART  B

 In this section, there was lot of emphasis on structures and macros.We could
 recall only 12 or 13 questions out of 20. All the questions were of multiple
 choices, which we don't remember for most questions.
 Q 1)  typedef struct {
                char * ;
                nodeptr NEXT ;
                } *nodeptr;
                What does nodeptr stand for?
 Q 2)  Supposing that each integer occupies 4 bytes and each character 1 byte,
       what is the output of the following program ?
       main()
       {
        int a[] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7};
        char c[] = {a,s,h,o,k};

          struct emp member = { "TIGER" };
          printf("%d  %f", member.empno, member.sal);
        }
 Q 7)  O/P of the program

        #define infiniteloop while(1)

2.6 Participation in the Project 

The Project being developed is functionally bifurcated in two modules :

1. Developing GUI at the PC
2. Interfacing PC with the IOP.

My role extends to the second module.

PC and IOP communicates over TCP/IP. Between the Front End and Back End , an application level protocol is developed to keep the Front End transparent of the exchange data organisation and to keep the Back End transparent of the type of Front End it is communicating with.

So far, in this module we have developed a server process at IOP that forks the child process as soon as it is approached by a client. This child process communicates with CRP in a synchronized manner, gets the results of the executed commands, forwards these to the client concerned. The client developed at PC is in C and is interfaced with the GUI in Java via JNI. This requires that all the processes be synchronized properly and efficiently.

                    Dear friend,
                    In the paper I am sending,there r about 40 vocabulary questions.But
                    this year's paper has only 20 of them.Time 5 min.Marks 10.Do only
                    15 or 16 bits correctly.
                            
                     Quantitative aptitude:I am sending 15 questions.In the latest paper we got,
                      there r only 10 of them r present.Time 10 min.Marks 20.Do all the 
                      problems correctly.


                      Reasoning:All answers r given.Remember them.In the exam, u willnot be
                      having time to read the passages.So remember the answers.
                      I dont remember twohe passages (R and Q).U can read these passages
                      in the exam and answer them.Remember: don't answer all questions.Write
                      7 or 8 incorrect answers.Time 45 min.Total 70 questions and Marks 70.


                      Your ultimate aim is to get 75 to 85 marks.Because if u get high marks,
                      they may assune that u know the paper beforehand and u may be disqualified.
                      So don't get morethan 90 marks.


                               WISH U ALL THE BEST.

1) There are two balls touching each other circumferencically.
The radius of the big ball is 4 times the diameter of the small
ball.The outer small ball rotates in anticlockwise direction
circumferencically over the bigger one at the rate of 16 rev/sec.
The bigger wheel also rotates anticlockwise at Nrev/sec. what is
'N' for the horizontal line from the centre of small wheel always
is horizontal.

 Q)  Strike off any digit from each number in seven rows (need not
 be at same place) and combine the same operations with 3 digit numbers
 to get the same addition. After this strike off another digit from all
 and add all the No.s to get the same 2 digit No. perform the same
 process again with 1 digit No.s. Give the ' no.s in 7 rows at
 each stage.

 I am adding some question which are not above. these question are
regarding flowcharts. sAME QUESTIONS WERE ASKED IN WIPRO APTITUDE PAPER ALSO.
Instrctions:
1) There are 7 flow charts & each has 5-6 blank rectangles/diamonds with
subquestion no. in rectangle/diamond. you have to fill the blank from the
5 options given against respective question no.
2) You have to understand the logic & then it is very easy to fill the
blanks.
3) they had provided some information which you have to use for getting
answers.
Flow charts:
1) there are 3 boxes of 3 balls each. you have to select the heaviest
among all.  
        
         <select box 1&2>
               |
         <is wt.1=wt.2>--No----(is wt1 > wt.2)--No--(select box2)
               |                       |                         |
              Yes                    Yes                         |
               |                        |                        |
         select box 3            select box 1                    |
               |                        |                        |  
               |------------------------|------------------------|      
               |
        select two balls
                |
         is wt.ball.1 = wt.ball.2 --- No --  is wt.ball.1> wt.ball.2 -- No
                |                                      |                |
               Yes                                     Yes              |
                |                                       |           ball.2
            ball.3 is                                  ball.1 is     is
             heaviest                                  heaviest     heavist

 so there will be some blank in this flow chart and u have to fill up the 
blanck with correct option. 


Q2)
    there are red and black balls. if ball is red then one point. if
ball is black and previous ball is red then two points. For winning u  
have to get seven points. No point for same color consecutive balls.  
   
        |----------- select ball
        |               |
        |           is ball red ---  Yes --  Is previous --No---   
        |                              |         ball red
        |               No           p=p+1        |

you should say everything confidently, whatever you say tell them frankly
and confidently i.e. I will do this, I will definetely learn within this
period, now I am learning etc. regarding C-language, COBOL, etc. They will
ask,

Q) How can you be best suited to our TCS (or Soft ware field)?
Ans: Some of my seniors told that TCS is doing consultancy business in
soft-ware field, this requires some sort of programming skills, knowledge of
programming languages, in addition to this it requires a sort of aptitude
skill which I am sure of possing it, this I can say based on my past
academic ahcievements. Also now I am learning C, I learned up to ....
(say arrays or functions) I will go through Pointers etc. also I am learning
COBOL, I am preparing for TCS C, COBOL test.

Question) Why are you shifting from your ............ field to software
field?
Ans: I am interested in soft-ware field, because of its bright & prosperous
future and quick recogniton of talent leading to faster growth.

They will ask about your family members and you, you just simply answer the

a pure ---- Engg student?
Ans: Actually I have taken Fortran/C/C++ as one of my courses in
B.Tech/Minor Area. course, now here in IIT I learned --------- languages(
something about what you learned in IITD), initially I found slightly
difficulty to compete with a student having computers background, but now I
am confident of learning programming skills as once I am in the process of
learning I am sure of achieving this.
here we have first talked about family, then about 4 minutes talk on my
project then they questioned on the project, then they asked about soft-ware
i.e do you know about INTERNET, Y2K problem, etc. I frankly told that I
donot know
about INTERNET, I know a little bit about Y2K problem and explained about
Y2K problem i.e now in all computers year is indicated by two digits only,
finally after the 99th year (1999) the computer will treat as 00 year(1900)
instead of considering it as 2000. meanwhile one or two question on my
academic record, about my refrigeration companies, etc. if you have a good
topic on your project, you tell about that one and have a little knowledge
on it so you can answer well their questions.

\par 
\par 
\par 
\par  I am adding some question which are not above. these question are
\par regarding flowcharts.
\par Instrctions:
\par 1) There are 7 flow charts & each has 5-6 blank
rectangles/diamonds with
\par subquestion no. in rectangle/diamond. you have to fill the blank
from the
\par 5 options given against respective question no.
\par 2) You have to understand the logic & then it is very easy to fill
the
\par blanks.
\par 3) they had provided some information which you have to use for
getting
\par answers.
\par Flow charts:
\par 1) there are 3 boxes of 3 balls each. you have to select the
heaviest
\par among all.  
\par         
\par          <select box 1&2>
