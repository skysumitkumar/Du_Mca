Pretty good. I graduate with a bachelor's degree

experience with software programming under my

Four years of school has also developed my soft

sample answer - 

Answer 1 (thing):

That would be the school library. Whenever I 
had an assignment or project, I would always 
go there to find information. It not only enabled 
me to keep current with the latest technologies 
in the field, but also played an important role 
in helping me develop my research ability. 
Meanwhile, it kept me motivated in my pursuit 
of new knowledge. I spent so many hours reading 
there.

Answer 2 (person):

That would be my classmates. We spent four years 
together and had a lot of fun through classes, 
team projects, and class events. 
Though we came from different places and had 
different backgrounds, we respected and supported 
one another. I have learned a lot from them. 
Meanwhile, dealing with my classmates has also 
developed my teamwork ability and interpersonal 
skills. I'm sure these skills are also critical 
to this position.

         2. "What impact does college have on you?"
    * Bad Answer:
         1. "Honestly, I don't see any." (fail to show your increased maturity)
         2. "Yes. Four years of college has taught me that I should not trust anybody around me. Some of my classmates were just evil." (may make the interviewer think that you will have trouble fitting into the team)


sample answer

Yes. First of all, college has developed my problem-solving ability. Before entering college, my parents took care of everything for me. Now since I live by myself on campus, I have to deal with all the problems on my own. This experience has turned me into a better problem solver. Besides, group projects and extracurricular activities have improved my interpersonal communication skills. I now feel more confident to deal with different kinds of people and to work in a team setting. I understand that good personal qualities like strong problem-solving ability and excellent interpersonal communication skills are the key requirements of the position. They are also what I can bring to this position.
