     remaining words are same as u send, which are not so difficult.
        try to know as many synonyms as possible for each word.
         for 10 ,11 words above try to learn from different sources,not

only from GRE.

        in mathamatical part remaining four questions are easy.

        coming to verbal reasoning the time is important factor here.
50 questions.25 minutes.i hope which is very difficult to solve completely.
try to do maximum as possible .i will give some idea about the reasoning.
for me it is not possible to reproduce all .whatever i remember ,i am
sending to u.
the overall idea about questions i am sending you ,so that u can read
fastly and answer in the exam. meaning of passage is same ,may be language
they used  different. ok.
