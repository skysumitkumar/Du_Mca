 <tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="insP"><tr><td>From the introduction, each of the five actors was honored with a Toby in
a different year 2000-2004.  By clue 5, Richard was awarded a Toby the year
after Mr. Newman, who won his award after the man honored for playing
Roy Cohn in <I>Angels in America</I>.  There are then three possible
arrangements for this clue:  the actor who won for playing Roy Cohn in
<I>Angels in America</I> was honored, followed the next year by Mr. Newman
and the year after that by Richard; the actor who won for Roy Cohn in
<I>Angels in America</I> was honored, then Mr. Newman won a Toby two years
and Richard three years after that; or the actor who won playing Roy Cohn
in <I>Angels in America</I> was honored in 2000, Mr. Newman in 2003, and
Richard in 2004.  Trying the last possibility--that the actor who won
playing Roy Cohn in <I>Angels in America</I> was honored in 2000, Mr. Newman
in 2003, and Richard in 2004--the actor who was honored as Ricky Roma in
<I>Glengarry Glen Ross</I> would have won in 2001, Mr. Burton in 2002, and
Gregory in 2003 (clue 2).  By clue 3, Mr. Peck would have won as either
Roy Cohn in <I>Angels in America</I> or Ricky Roma in <I>Glengarry Glen
Ross</I>--which he did not (7).  So possibility three fails.  Trying the
second possibility--the actor who won for Roy Cohn in <I>Angels in America</I>
was honored, then Mr. Newman won a Toby two years and Richard three years
after that--by clue 2, Mr. Burton would have won for playing Roy Cohn in
<I>Angels in America</I>, with the man honored for his role as Ricky Roma
in <I>Glengarry Glen Ross</I> winning in 2000; or Gregory would have won in
2004, Richard Burton in 2003, and Mr. Newman in 2002 as Ricky Roma in
<I>Glengarry Glen Ross</I>.  In the first case, since Mr. Peck didn't star
as Roy Cohn in <I>Angels in America</I> or Ricky Roma in <I>Glengarry Glen
Ross</I> (7), by clue 3, he would have won in 2002 and Paul in 2003.
Gregory would be Mr. Peck (2).  By clue 1, Mr. Burton would be Burt.
However, there is no way for clue 6 to work given this arrangement.
In the second case, Mr. peck would have won in 2001 (7) and Paul in 2002 (3).
However, clue 6 again can;'t work given this arrangement.  Therefore,
possibility two fails.  In clue 5, then, the actor who won for playing Roy
Cohn in <I>Angels in America</I> was honored, followed the next year by Mr.
Newman and the year after that by Richard.  There are three ways for clue 1
to combine with clue 5: Richard won in 2002, Mr. Newman in 2001, and the man
who starred as Roy Cohn in <I>Angels in America</I> in 2000, with Burt winning
in 2003 and the 2004 Toby winner playing Big Daddy in <I>Cat on a Hot Tin Roof</I>;
Richard won in 2004, Mr. Newman in 2003, and the man who starred as Roy Cohn
in <I>Angels in America</I> in 2002, with Burt winning in 2000 and the 2001
Toby winner playing Big Daddy in <I>Cat on a Hot Tin Roof</I>; or Mr. Newman
won for his portrayal of Big Daddy in <I>Cat on a Hot Tin Roof</I> and
Burt for Roy Cohn in <I>Angels in America</I>.  Trying the
first possibility--that Richard won in 2002, Mr. Newman in 2001, and the
man who starred as Roy Cohn in <I>Angels in America</I> in 2000, with Burt
winning in 2003 and the 2004 Toby winner playing Big Daddy in <I>Cat on a
Hot Tin Roof</I>--Gregory would have won in 2004 (2) and Kirk in 2001 (6).
However, Paul would have won in 2000--no (3).  So the first possibility fails.
Trying the second possibility--that Richard won in 2004, Mr. Newman in 2003,
and the man who starred as Roy Cohn in <I>Angels in America</I> in 2002, with
Burt winning in 2000 and the 2001 Toby winner playing Big Daddy in <I>Cat on
a Hot Tin Roof</I>--Gregory would have won in 2003 and Mr. Burton in 2001,
with Burt winning for Ricky Roma in <I>Glengarry Glen Ross</I> (2).  By
clue 3, then, Mr. Peck would have won for Ricky Roma in <I>Glengarry Glen
Ross</I>, which he did not (6).  So, possibility two above also fails.  We
thus have Mr. Newman winning the Toby for his portrayal of Big Daddy in
<I>Cat on a Hot Tin Roof</I> and Burt winning for Roy Cohn in <I>Angels
in America</I>.  There are three ways for clue 2 to combine with this
arrangement:  Richard won for Ricky Roma in <I>Glengarry Glen Ross</I> in
2002, with Mr. Burton's Toby coming in 2003 and Gregory's in 2004; the man
who was honored for Ricky Roma in <I>Glengarry Glen Ross</I> won in 2000
and Mr. Burton in 2001, with Gregory then Mr. Newman; or Gregory is Mr.
Newman and Burt Mr. Burton, with the man starring as Ricky Roma in
<I>Glengarry Glen Ross</I> winning his Toby the year before Burt Burton.
Trying the first possibility--that Richard won for Ricky Roma in <I>Glengarry
Glen Ross</I> in 2002, Mr. Burton's Toby came in 2003, and Gregory won in
2004, with Mr. Newman named for Big Daddy in <I>Cat on a Hot Tin Roof</I>
in 2001 and Burt for Roy Cohn in <I>Angels in America</I> in 2000--2004
winner Gregory would have to be Mr. Peck (7), which contradicts clue 3.
Trying the second possibility--that the man who was honored for Ricky Roma
in <I>Glengarry Glen Ross</I> won in 2000, Mr. Burton in 2001, and Gregory
Newman for Big Daddy in <I>Cat on a Hot Tin Roof</I> in 2003, with Burt
winning as Roy Cohn in <I>Angels in America</I> in 2002 and Richard receiving
the 2004 Toby--2004 winner Richard would have to be Peck, conflicting with clue
3.  So, we know Gregory is Mr. Newman and Burt Mr. Burton and that Burt's win
came one year after the man who won as Ricky Roma in <I>Glengarry Glen Ross</I>.
By clue 6, Mr. Douglas won for Ricky Roma in <I>Glengarry Glen Ross</I> and
Kirk won a year earlier--in 2000.  Paul is Mr. Douglas and Kirk Mr. Peck (3).
By elimination, Richard is Lancaster.  Then he won for his role as George in
<I>Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolfe</I> (4), with Kirk Peck's Toby awarded for
his portrayal of Hickey Hickman in <I>The Iceman Cometh</I>. In sum, the five
most recent Toby Best Actor winners are
<P>
<UL>
<LI> 2004 -- Richard Lancaster as George in <I>Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolfe</I><BR>
<LI> 2003 -- Gregory Newman as Big Daddy in <I>Cat on a Hot Tin Roof</I><BR>
<LI> 2002 -- Burt Burton as Roy Cohn in <I>Angels in America</I><BR>
