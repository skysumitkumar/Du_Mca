 <tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="insP"><tr><td>By clue 11, the child who won the rainbow sprinkles cupcakes won in the Cupcake Walk
immediately before the child who won the Reese's Pieces cupcakes.  Since the latter
cupcakes weren't won on the 5th round (clue 11), the rainbow sprinkles cupcakes were
the prize in the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd round.  If the rainbow sprinkles were the 2nd
round prize cupcakes and the Reese's Pieces the 3rd, by clue 1, the M & M's cupcakes
would have been won in the 4th walk, and "The Ants Go Marching" would have been the
song played during the 5th walk.  By clue 8, then, the chocolate chip cupcakes
would have been the prize in the 5th round, with "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star"
being played during the M & M's cupcakes walk--no (5).  Therefore, the rainbow sprinkles
cupcakes didn't go in the 2nd Cupcake Walk.  If they had gone in the 3rd round of
walking and the Reese's Pieces in the 4th, by clue 1, the M & M's cupcakes would have
been the prize during walk 2, "The Ants Go Marching" would have played during
the 3rd walk, and Christopher would have been the 1st to win a Cupcake Walk.  By
clue 8, "Twinkle, Twinkle" would have played during walk 4, and the chococlate chip
cupcakes would have gone in the 5th round.  By clue 4, Jenny would have won the Reese's
Pieces cupcakes, and the song "The Wheels on the Bus" would have played when the
chocolate chip cupcakes were won on the 5th walk--a conflict with clue 2.  Therefore,
the rainbow sprinkles cupcakes didn't go in the 3rd Cupcake Walk.  The rainbow
sprinkles cupcakes were the prize in the 1st and the Reese's Pieces cupcakes the
prize in the 2nd walk.  By clue 1, then, the M & M's cupcakes were awarded as the
3rd or 4th walk prize.  If they had been for the 3rd walk, with "The Ants Go Marching"
then played during the 4th, by clue 8, "Twinkle, Twinkle" would have been played
for walk 3, and the chocolate chip cupcakes would have been the 4th round award.
Since Christopher didn't win the Reese's Pieces cupcakes (7), he would have won the
rainbow sprinkles (1).  By clue 4, then, Jenny would have won the 4th walk to the
tune of "The Ants Go Marching"--no (9).  Therefore, the M & M's cupcakes were the prize for
the 4th Cupcake Walk rather than the 3rd, with "The Ants" being played during the
5th go-round.  Since "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star" didn't play during the walk when
the M & M's cupcakes were won (5), "Twinkle" was the song played during round 2, with
the chocolate chip cupcakes then the prize for the 3rd walk (8).  By elimination,
the cupcakes won during the 5th walk were iced with strawberry icing.  Since "The
Wheels on the Bus" didn't play when the chocolate chip cupcakes were the prize (2),
by clue 4, Jenny won the chocolate chip cupcakes on the 3rd walk, and "The Wheels" was
played to award the M & M's cupcakes.  By clue 6, "Itsy-Bitsy Spider" was the 3rd song
and "Old MacDonald Had a Farm" the 1st song played.  Christopher didn't win the
Reese's Pieces cupcakes (7); by clue 1, he won the rainbow sprinkles.  Ben won the
strawberry cupcakes (3), while Tess won the M & M's cupcakes (10).  Megan was the
winner of the 2nd Cupcake Walk and won the Reese's Pieces cupcakes to the tune of
"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star."  In sum, the Cupcake Walk results were as follows:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> 1 - Christopher, rainbow sprinkles, "Old MacDonald Had a Farm"<BR>
<LI> 2 - Megan, Reese's Pieces, "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star" <BR>
<LI> 3 - Jenny, chocolate chips, "Itsy-Bitsy Spider"<BR>
<LI> 4 - Tess, M & M's, "The Wheels on the Bus"<BR>
<LI> 5 - Ben, strawberry, "The Ants Go Marching"<BR>
