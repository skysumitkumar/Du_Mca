	Take a piece of fruit from the box marked "apples and oranges." Suppose the fruit you take is an apple.  Then that box must be the box containing just apples.  Therefore, the box marked "oranges" can't be the box containing just apples, and it can't be the box containing just oranges either -- so it must be the box containing apples and oranges.  The remaining box is therefore the box containing just oranges.<p> If the fruit you take out is an orange, the solution is derived in a similar fashion:  the box marked "apples and oranges" is the box containing just oranges; the box marked "apples" is the box containing both apples and oranges; and the box marked "oranges" is the one containing just apples.
