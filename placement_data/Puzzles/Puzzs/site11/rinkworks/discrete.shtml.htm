The men are shown five hats, three of which are black and two of which are white.  Then the men are blindfolded, and one of the five hats is placed on each man's head.  The remaining two hats are hidden away.  The blindfolds are removed.  The men are told that if just one of the men can guess what hat he's wearing, they may all go free.  Time passes.

But there is only one boat, and it can only hold two bodies (regardless of their size), and only the humans or the big monkey are strong enough to row the boat.

Each of the connectors is numbered from one to seven, each number being used exactly once.  The same is true for the holes in the outlet.  The device that uses this cable only requires that one of the connectors match up to its corresponding hole in order to operate.  How should you number the connectors on the plug and the holes in the outlet so that, no matter how the cable is rotated and plugged in, at least one connector matches up? </td><td><p><a href="wd.28.shtml.htm" tppabs="http://rinkworks.com/brainfood/s/wd.28.shtml">Solution</a></td></tr>

They encountered a river that was swift and deep.  The only way to cross it was an abandoned boat, left ashore on their side.  But it would only hold three living things. Unfortunately, the dogs were edgy and could not be near another person (not even momentarily) unless its owner was present.  One of the dogs attended a highly advanced, highly specialized obedience school and therefore knew how to operate the boat -- the other dogs lack this skill.

After this second shuffling, the cards were in the following order:  10, 9, Q, 8, K, 3, 4, A, 5, J, 6, 2, 7.

Each of the four hats are one of three different colors (red, white, and blue), and there is at least one hat of each color (so there's one duplicate).  Each of the intellectuals, starting with the back and ending with the front, is asked the color of the hat he is wearing.  Each of the intellectuals is able to deduce and give a correct answer out loud, in turn.

Between 3 and 4 is a brick wall.  So 1, at the back of the line, can see 2 and 3.  2 can see 3.  Neither 3 and 4 can see anybody.  The men know that two of them are wearing black hats and two of them are wearing white hats.  The commander of the firing squad offers a challenge.  The challenge is that he will let all of them go if only one of them correctly names the color of his own hat.  The men are not allowed to talk amongst themselves.
