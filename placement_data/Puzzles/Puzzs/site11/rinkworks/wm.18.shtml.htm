	Let <em>x</em> be the age of the man at the time of his death.  His age consists of the number of years he spent as a child plus the number of years he spent as a teenager plus the number of years between his coming of age and his marriage plus five plus his son's age (half his own) plus four. In mathematical terms, this is:<p> <pre>        x = x/6 + x/12 + x/7 + 5 + x/2 + 4<br>        x = 14x/84 + 7x/84 + 12x/84 + 42x/84 + 9<br>        x = 75x/84 + 9<br>        84x/84 - 75x/84 = 9<br>        9x/84 = 9<br>        x/84 = 1<br>        x = 84 </pre><p> So the man lived to be 84 years old. 
</kbd>
<center><h4>Alternate Solution #2</h4></center><p><kbd>
	The man lived 1/12 of his life as a teenager.  There are seven teen years.  7 x 12 = 84.
