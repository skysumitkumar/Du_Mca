	Pick one of the men and ask, "If I were to ask you whether the left fork leads to where I'm going, and you chose to answer that question with the same degree of truth as you answer this question, would you then answer 'yes'?" <p>The truthteller will say "yes" if the left fork leads to where you're going and "no" otherwise.  The liar will answer the same, since he will lie about where the left fork leads, and he will lie about lying.  The third man  may either lie or tell the truth about this one question, but either way he is behaving like either the truthteller or the liar and thus must correctly report the road to your destination.
