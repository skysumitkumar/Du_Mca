	You can buy any number of nuggets that is evenly divisible by three except for three just by using combinations of boxes of 6 and boxes of 9. (Use at most one box of 9, then multiples of boxes of 6.)  If the number is not divisible by three, use a box of 20.  If, after a box of 20 is purchased, the remaining number is divisible by three, you're all set.  Otherwise, use a second box of 20.  The remaining number will necessarily be divisible by 3, and you're all set.<p> So the largest number that cannot be purchased would be one that requires two boxes of 20 before the remainder is reduced to a number divisible by three. Since three is the only number evenly divisible by three that cannot be purchased, the largest impossible number is 3 + 20 + 20 = 43.
