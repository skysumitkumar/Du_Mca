	The back man can see the hats worn by the two men in front of him. So, if both of those hats were white, he would know that the hat he wore was black.  But, since he doesn't answer, he must see at least one black hat ahead of him.<p> After it becomes apparent to the middle man that the back man can't figure out what he's wearing, he knows that there is at least one black hat worn by himself and the front man.  Knowing this, if the middle man saw a white hat in front of him, he'd know that his own hat was black, and could answer the question correctly.  But, since he doesn't answer, he must see a black hat on the front man.<p> After it becomes apparent to the front man that neither of the men behind him can answer the question, he realizes the middle man saw a black hat in front of him.  So he says, correctly, "My hat is black."
