Three children <img src="1.gif" tppabs="http://www.qbyte.org/puzzles/1.gif" width="12" height="12" alt="1 star" /></h2><p>On the first day of a new job, a colleague invites you around for a barbecue.&nbsp; As the two of you arrive at his home, a young boy throws open the door to welcome his father.&nbsp; &#8220;My other two kids will be home soon!&#8221; remarks your colleague.</p>
<p>Waiting in the kitchen while your colleague gets some drinks from the basement, you notice a letter from the principal of the local school tacked to the noticeboard.&nbsp; &#8220;Dear Parents,&#8221; it begins, &#8220;This is the time of year when I write to all parents, such as yourselves, who have a girl or girls in the school, asking you to volunteer your time to help the girls' soccer team.&#8221;&nbsp; &#8220;Hmmm,&#8221; you think to yourself, &#8220;clearly they have at least one of each!&#8221;</p>
<p>This, of course, leaves two possibilities: two boys and a girl, or two girls and a boy.&nbsp; Are these two possibilities equally likely, or is one more likely than the other?</p>
<p>Note:&nbsp; This is not a trick puzzle.&nbsp; You should assume all things that it seems you're meant to assume, and not assume things that you aren't told to assume.&nbsp; If things can easily be imagined in either of two ways, you should assume that they are equally likely.&nbsp; For example, you may be able to imagine a reason that a colleague with two boys and a girl would be more likely to have invited you to dinner than one with two girls and a boy.&nbsp; If so, this would affect the probabilities of the two possibilities.&nbsp; But if your imagination is that good, you can probably imagine the opposite as well.&nbsp; You should assume that any such extra information not mentioned in the story is not available.</p>

Five card trick <img src="3.gif" tppabs="http://www.qbyte.org/puzzles/3.gif" width="40" height="12" alt="3 star" /></h2><p>Two information theoreticians, A and B, perform a trick with a shuffled deck of cards, jokers removed.&nbsp; A asks a member of the audience to select five cards at random from the deck.&nbsp; The audience member passes the five cards to A, who examines them, and hands one back.&nbsp; A then arranges the remaining four cards in some way and places them face down, in a neat pile.</p>
<p>B, who has not witnessed these proceedings, then enters the room, looks at the four cards, and determines the missing fifth card, held by the audience member.&nbsp; How is this trick done?</p>
<p>Note: The only communication between A and B is via the arrangement of the four cards.&nbsp; There is no encoded speech or hand signals or ESP, no bent or marked cards, no clue in the orientation of the pile of four cards...</p>
