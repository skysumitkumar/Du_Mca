<h1 id="main">Solution to puzzle 3: Two logicians</h1>
<p><a href="#sol"><img src="s.gif" tppabs="http://www.qbyte.org/puzzles/s.gif" alt="Skip restatement of puzzle." height="1" width="1" /></a>Two perfect logicians, S and P, are told that integers x and y have been chosen such that 1&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;x&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;y and x+y&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;100.&nbsp; S is given the value x+y and P is given the value xy.&nbsp; They then have the following conversation.</p>
<blockquote class="b"><p>P:&nbsp; I cannot determine the two numbers.<br />
S:&nbsp; I knew that.<br />
P:&nbsp; Now I can determine them.<br />
S:&nbsp; So can I.</p></blockquote>
<p>Given that the above statements are true, what are the two numbers?</p>
<hr /><p id="sol">First of all, trivially, xy cannot be <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PrimeNumber.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PrimeNumber.html'" tppabs="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PrimeNumber.html">prime</a>.&nbsp; It also cannot be the square of a prime, for that would imply x&nbsp;=&nbsp;y.</p>
<p>We now deduce as much as possible from each of the logicians' statements.&nbsp; We have only <em>public</em> information: the problem statement, the logicians' statements, and the knowledge that the logicians, being perfect, will always make correct and complete deductions.&nbsp; Each logician has, in addition, one piece of <em>private</em> information: sum or product.</p>
<blockquote class="b"><p>P:&nbsp; I cannot determine the two numbers.</p></blockquote>
<p>P's statement implies that xy cannot have exactly two distinct <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ProperFactor.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ProperFactor.html'" tppabs="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ProperFactor.html">proper factors</a> whose sum is less than&nbsp;100.&nbsp; Call such a pair of factors <em>eligible</em>.</p>
<p>For example, xy cannot be the product of two distinct primes, for then P could deduce the numbers.&nbsp; Likewise, xy cannot be the cube of a prime, such as 3<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;27, for then 3&times;9 would be a unique factorization; or the fourth power of a prime.</p>
<p>Other combinations are ruled out by the fact that the sum of the two factors must be less than&nbsp;100.&nbsp; For example, xy cannot be 242&nbsp;=&nbsp;2&times;11<sup>2</sup>, since 11&times;22 is the unique eligible factorization; 2&times;121 being ineligible.&nbsp; Similarly for xy&nbsp;=&nbsp;318&nbsp;=&nbsp;2&times;3&times;53.</p>
<blockquote class="b"><p>S:&nbsp; I knew that.</p></blockquote>
<p>If S was sure that P could not deduce the numbers, then none of the possible summands of x+y can be such that their product has exactly one pair of eligible factors.&nbsp; For example, x+y could not be&nbsp;51, since summands&nbsp;17 and&nbsp;34 produce xy&nbsp;=&nbsp;578, which would permit P to deduce the numbers.</p>
<p>We can generate a list of values of x+y that are never the sum of precisely two eligible factors.&nbsp; The following list is generated by JavaScript; the function may be inspected by viewing <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.qbyte.org/puzzles/p003s.txt  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it was unavailable, or its retrieval was aborted, or the project was stopped too soon.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.qbyte.org/puzzles/p003s.txt'" tppabs="http://www.qbyte.org/puzzles/p003s.txt" type="text/plain">JavaScript: function genSum</a> (plain text.)</p>

<p>(We can use <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GoldbachConjecture.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GoldbachConjecture.html'" tppabs="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GoldbachConjecture.html">Goldbach's Conjecture</a>, which states that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes, to deduce that the above list can contain only odd numbers.&nbsp; Although the conjecture remains unproven, it has been confirmed empirically up to 4&times;10<sup>14</sup>.)</p>
<blockquote class="b"><p>P:&nbsp; Now I can determine them.</p></blockquote>
<p>P now knows that x+y is one of the values listed above.&nbsp; If this enables P to deduce x and y, then, of the eligible factorizations of xy, there must be precisely one for which the sum of the factors is in the list.&nbsp; The table below, generated by JavaScript (view plain text <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.qbyte.org/puzzles/p003s.txt  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it was unavailable, or its retrieval was aborted, or the project was stopped too soon.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.qbyte.org/puzzles/p003s.txt'" tppabs="http://www.qbyte.org/puzzles/p003s.txt" type="text/plain">JavaScript: function genProd</a>), shows all such xy, together with the corresponding x, y, and x+y.&nbsp; The table is sorted by sum and then product.</p>
<p>Note that a product may be absent from the table for one of two reasons.&nbsp; Either <em>none</em> of its eligible factorizations appears in the above list of eligible sums (example: 12&nbsp;=&nbsp;2&times;6 and 3&times;4; sums 8 and 7), or <em>more than one</em> such factorization appears (example: 30&nbsp;=&nbsp;2&times;15 and 5&times;6; sums 17 and 11.)</p>
<blockquote class="b"><p>S:&nbsp; So can I.</p></blockquote>
<p>If S can deduce the numbers from the table below, there must be a sum that appears exactly once in the table.&nbsp; Checking the table, we find just one such sum: 17.</p>
<noscript><div>(Your browser does not support JavaScript, or you do not have JavaScript enabled. Therefore you cannot view the table below. The table would show that the only row with a unique sum has x = 4 and y = 13. The first six rows in the table have the following values for (x,y): (2,9), (3,8), (4,7), (4,13), (4,19), (7,16).)</div></noscript>
<p>Therefore, <em>we</em> are able to deduce that the numbers are x&nbsp;=&nbsp;4 and y&nbsp;=&nbsp;13.</p>
