<h1 id="main">Answer to puzzle 13: Coin triplets</h1>
<h2>a. What is the optimal strategy for each player?&nbsp; With best play, who is most likely to win?</h2>
<p>The <em>second</em> player can always choose a triplet that has a better than 1/2 probability of appearing before the first player's triplet.</p>
<p>The best strategy for player 1 is to limit player 2's probability of winning to 2/3.&nbsp; This can be done by choosing triplet HTH or HTT, or their mirror images, THT or THH.</p>
<p>Player 2 should choose a triplet that maximizes the chance of winning, based upon player 1's choice.&nbsp; In each case, this is a unique choice, as follows:<br />
1 plays HHH, 2 plays THH and wins with probability 7/8;<br />1 plays HHT, 2 plays THH and wins with probability 3/4;<br />
1 plays HTH, 2 plays HHT and wins with probability 2/3;<br />1 plays HTT, 2 plays HHT and wins with probability 2/3.</p>
<h2>b. Suppose the triplets were chosen in secret?&nbsp; What then would be the optimal strategy?</h2>
<p>An optimal strategy for both players is to choose at random, with probability 1/2 for each, between HTT, and its mirror image, THH.</p>
<h2>c. What would be the optimal strategy against a randomly selected triplet?</h2>
<p>We must decide what to do if our play matches the randomly selected triplet.&nbsp; We may call this void and play again, or we may split the (notional) winnings.&nbsp; The decision does not affect our choice of best play, but it does slightly alter the expected return from each play.</p>
<p>The best play against a random triplet is HTT, or its mirror image, THH.&nbsp; The table below shows the expected return and percentage expected profit from each play.</p>
