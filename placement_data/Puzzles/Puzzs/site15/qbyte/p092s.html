<h1 id="main">Solution to puzzle 92: Consecutive integer sums</h1>
<p>In how many ways can 50! be expressed as a sum of two or more consecutive positive integers?</p><hr />
<p>Let n be a positive integer.&nbsp; We first consider the more general problem of how many ways n may be expressed as a sum of <em>one</em> or more consecutive integers, <em>whether positive, negative, or zero</em>.&nbsp; We will show that the number of such representations is equal to the number of positive odd divisors of&nbsp;n.&nbsp;(Note: The term divisor includes&nbsp;1 and the number itself.&nbsp; So, for example,&nbsp;9 has three positive divisors.)</p>
<h2>Determine the number of representations of n</h2>
<p>Consider the number of ways in which n may be expressed as the sum of an <em>odd</em> number of consecutive integers.<br />
All such solutions take the form n = (a - b) + ... + a + ... + (a + b), for some pair of integers, a, b, with b&nbsp;<img src="ge.gif" tppabs="http://www.qbyte.org/puzzles/ge.gif" width="13" height="13" alt="greater than or equal to" />&nbsp;0.<br />
That is, n = a(2b + 1).<br />
Hence the number of solutions of this equation is equal to the number of positive odd divisors of n.</p>
<p>Now consider the number of ways in which n may be expressed as the sum of an <em>even</em> number of consecutive integers.<br />
All such solutions take the form n = (a - b + 1) + ... + a + (a + 1) + ... + (a + b), for some pair of integers, a, b, with b&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;0.<br />
That is, n = (a + &frac12;) &times; 2b = (2a + 1)b.&nbsp; Note that b &gt; 0 <img src="imp.gif" tppabs="http://www.qbyte.org/puzzles/imp.gif" width="16" height="9" alt="implies" /> 2a + 1 &gt; 0.<br />
Hence the number of solutions of this equation is again equal to the number of positive odd divisors of n.</p>
<p>The total number of representations of n is therefore twice the number of positive odd divisors of n.</p>
<p>Now consider the representations of n whose greatest term is d; that is, n = c + ... + d.<br />
Note that, if c is positive, we may prefix the sum with consecutive terms (1 - c) + ... + (c - 1) = 0, so that n = (1 - c) + ... +&nbsp;d, a representation of&nbsp;n whose first term, (1&nbsp;-&nbsp;c), is <em>not</em> positive.<br />
Clearly this is the only way in which consecutive terms may be added or removed, while leaving the greatest term and the sum unchanged.<br />
Similarly, if (1 - c) <img src="le.gif" tppabs="http://www.qbyte.org/puzzles/le.gif" width="13" height="13" alt="less than or equal to" /> 0, the only way to leave the sum unchanged is to remove the consecutive terms (1 - c) + ... + (c - 1) = 0.<br />
So, for each representation of n with all positive terms, there is precisely one representation in which <em>not</em> all the terms are positive.<br />
Hence exactly half of the representations of n contain only positive integers.<br />
That is, the number of ways in which&nbsp;n may be expressed as a sum of one or more consecutive positive integers is equal to the number of positive odd divisors of&nbsp;n.</p>
<h2>Determine the number of odd divisors of 50!</h2>
<p>The number of divisors of an integer may be determined by considering its prime factorization.&nbsp; The <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://odin.mdacc.tmc.edu/~krc/numbers/fta.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://odin.mdacc.tmc.edu/~krc/numbers/fta.html'" tppabs="http://odin.mdacc.tmc.edu/~krc/numbers/fta.html">Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic</a> guarantees that the prime factorization is unique.</p>
<p>Let n = p<sub>1</sub><sup>a<sub>1</sub></sup> &middot; ... &middot; p<sub>r</sub><sup>a<sub>r</sub></sup> , where p<sub>1</sub> ... p<sub>r</sub> are prime numbers, and a<sub>1</sub> ... a<sub>r</sub> are positive integers.<br />
Now, each divisor of n is composed of the same prime factors, where the <em>i</em>th exponent can range from 0 to a<sub>i</sub>.<br />
Hence there are a<sub>1</sub> + 1 choices for the first exponent, a<sub>2</sub> + 1 choices for the second, and so on.<br />
Therefore the number of positive divisors of n is (a<sub>1</sub> + 1)(a<sub>2</sub> + 1) ... (a<sub>r</sub> + 1).</p>
<p>We may determine the prime factorization of 50! by a direct counting argument.</p>
<p>Consider the number of 2s in the prime factorization.<br />
There are [50/2] = 25 integers between 1 and 50 that are divisible by 2.&nbsp;(Where [x] is the greatest integer less than or equal to&nbsp;x.)<br />
We must also count the [50/4] = 12 multiples of 4, each of which contributes an additional factor of 2.<br />
Continuing this argument, the number of 2s in the prime factororization of 50! is equal to [50/2]&nbsp;+&nbsp;[50/4]&nbsp;+&nbsp;[50/8]&nbsp;+&nbsp;[50/16]&nbsp;+&nbsp;[50/32]&nbsp;=&nbsp;25&nbsp;+&nbsp;12&nbsp;+&nbsp;6&nbsp;+&nbsp;3&nbsp;+&nbsp;1&nbsp;=&nbsp;47.<br />
Similarly, the number of 3s is equal to [50/3] + [50/9] + [50/27] = 16 + 5 + 1 = 22.<br />
We thus find that 50! = 2<sup>47</sup> &times; 3<sup>22</sup> &times; 5<sup>12</sup> &times; 7<sup>8</sup> &times; 11<sup>4</sup> &times; 13<sup>3</sup> &times; 17<sup>2</sup> &times; 19<sup>2</sup> &times; 23<sup>2</sup> &times; 29 &times; 31 &times; 37 &times; 41 &times; 43 &times; 47.</p>
<p>The number of odd divisors of 50! is thus equal to 1 &times; 23 &times; 13 &times; 9 &times; 5 &times; 4 &times; 3<sup>3</sup> &times; 2<sup>6</sup> = 93,000,960.<br />
We then subtract the unique representation of 50! as the sum of <em>one</em> consecutive positive integer: 50!&nbsp;=&nbsp;30,414,093,201,713,378,043,612,608,166,064,768,844,377,641,568,960,512,000,000,000,000.</p>
<p>Hence, 50! can be expressed as a sum of two or more consecutive positive integers in&nbsp;93,000,959 ways.</p>
<hr /><h2 class="h3">Remarks</h2>
<p>Note that a power of 2 has only one odd divisor: 1.&nbsp; This divisor corresponds to the trivial representation of a power of&nbsp;2 as one consecutive integer: itself.&nbsp; Any integer that is <em>not</em> a power of&nbsp;2 has at least two odd divisors.&nbsp; Hence, the only positive integers that do not have a representation as a sum of two or more consecutive positive integers are powers of&nbsp;2.</p>
