LOGIC PUZZLES I.

Bulbs
Keep the first bulb switched on for a few minutes. It gets warm, right? So all you have to do then is ... switch it off, switch another one on, walk into the room with bulbs, touch them and tell which one was switched on as the first one (the warm one) and the others can be easily identified ...


Ball in a Hole
All you have to do is pour some water into the pipe so that the ball swims up on the surface.


The Man in the Elevator
The man is a midget. He can't reach the upper elevator buttons, but he can ask people to push them for him. He can also push them with his umbrella.


Ball
Throw the ball straight up in the air.


Magnet
You can hang the iron rods on a string and watch which one turns to the north (or hang just one rod).
Gardner gives one more solution: take one rod and touch with its end the middle of the second rod. If they get closer, then you have a magnet in your hand.
The real magnet will have a magnetic field at its poles, but not at its center. So as previously mentioned, if you take the iron bar and touch its tip to the magnet's center, the iron bar will not be attracted. This is assuming that the magnet's poles are at its ends. If the poles run through the length of the magnet, then it would be much harder to use this method. 
In that case, rotate one rod around its axis while holding an end of the other to its middle. If the rotating rod is the magnet, the force will fluctuate as the rod rotates. If the rotating rod is not magnetic, the force is constant (provided you can keep their positions steady). 


Castle
You can put one foot-bridge over one corner (thus a triangle is created). Then from the middle of this foot-bridge lay another foot-bridge to the edge (corner) of the castle. You can make a few easy equations confirming that this is enough.
 
 


Biology
The saucer was half full at 11.59 - the next minute there will be twice as many of them there (so full at 12.00).


Sheikh’s Heritage
The wise man told them to switch camels.


Philosopher’s Clock
Clocks can measure time even when they do not show the right time. You just have to wind the clock up and...
We have to suppose that the journey to the friend and back lasts exactly the same time and the friend has a clock (showing the correct time) - it would be too easy if mentioned in the riddle.
Now there is no problem to figure out the solution, is there?


Masters of Logic I. (dots)
The wisest one must have thought like this:
I see all hands up and 2 red dots, so I can have either a blue or a red dot. If I had a blue one, the other 2 guys would see all hands up and one red and one blue dot. So they would have to think that if the second one of them (the other with red dot) sees the same blue dot, then he must see a red dot on the first one with red dot. However, they were both silent (and they are wise), so I have a red dot on my forehead.


Masters of Logic II. (hats)
The important thing in this riddle is that all masters had equal chances to win. If one of them had been given a black hat and the other white hats, the one with black hat would immediately have known his color (unlike the others). So 1 black and 2 white hats is not a fair distribution.
If there had been one white and two black hats distributed, then the two with black hats would have had advantage. They would have been able to see one black and one white hat and supposing they had been given white hat, then the one with black hat must at once react as in the previous situation. However, if he had remained silent, then the guys with black hats would have known that they wear black hats, whereas the one with white hat would have been forced to eternal thinking with no clear answer. So neither this is a fair situation.
That’s why the only way of giving each master an equal chance is to distribute hats of one color – so 3 black hats.
I hope this is clear enough ?.


Masters of Logic III. (stamps)
B says: "Suppose I have red-red. A would have said on her second turn: 'I see that B has red-red. If I also have red-red, then all four reds would be used, and C would have realized that she had green-green. But C didn't, so I don't have red-red. Suppose I have green-green. In that case, C would have realized that if she had red-red, I would have seen four reds and I would have answered that I had green-green on my first turn. On the other hand, if she also has green-green [we assume that A can see C; this line is only for completeness], then B would have seen four greens and she would have answered that she had two reds. So C would have realized that, if I have green-green and B has red-red, and if neither of us answered on our first turn, then she must have green-red. 
"'But she didn't. So I can't have green-green either, and if I can't have green-green or red-red, then I must have green-red.' 
So B continues: 
"But she (A) didn't say that she had green-red, so the supposition that I have red-red must be wrong. And as my logic applies to green-green as well, then I must have green-red." 
So B had green-red, and we don't know the distribution of the others certainly. 
(Actually, it is possible to take the last step first, and deduce that the person who answered YES must have a solution which would work if the greens and reds were switched -- red-green.) 


Head Bands
The first one (he did not see any head bands) thought this way:
The last one is silent, which means, he does not know, ergo at least one of head bands he sees is white. The one in the middle is silent too even though he knows what I already mentioned. If I had a red head band, the second one would have known that he had a white head band. However, nobody says anything, so my head band is not red – my head band is white.


Christmas Tree
There are 2 possible solutions:
1. if angels B and C had aureole of the same color, then angel A must have immediately said his own color (other then theirs),
2. if angels B and C had different colors, then angel A must have been silent and that would have been a signal for angel B, who could know (looking at angel C) what his own color is (the other one then C had).



LOGIC PUZZLES II.

Brick
There is an easy equation which can help:
1 brick = 1 kg + 1/2 brick
And so 1 brick is 2 kg heavy.


Strange Coins
This was just a catch question. One of the coins is really not a nickel because nickel is the other coin.


What is Correct
Of course, adding seven to five makes twelve and not thirteen.


Trains
Of course, when the trains encounter, they will be approximately the same distance away from New York. The New York train will be closer to New York by approximately one train length because they're coming from different directions.  That is, unless you take "meet" to mean "pefectly overlap".


Fly
There is a complicated way counting a sequence. Or simply knowing that if the fly is flying the 2 hours still at the same speed of 75 km/h then it flies a distance of 150 km.


Speeding up
This one has no solution. Unless we are complicating it with relativity theory - time and space. But to keep it simple, you can't reach the desired average speed under the given circumstances.


Wired Equator
It is easy to subtract 2 equations (original perimeter = 2xPIxR, length of wire = 2xPIxR +  2xPIx(new R)) and find out that the result is 10m/(2xPI), which is about 1.6 m. So a smaller man can go under it and a bigger man ducks.


Diofantos
There is an easy equation to reflect the several ages of Diofantos:
1/6x + 1/12x + 1/7x + 5 + 1/2x + 4 = x
So the solution (x) is 84 years.


Ahmes's Papyrus
2 equations give a clear answer to the given question:
5w + 10d = 100
7*(2w + d) = 3r + 9d
Where w is amount of corn for the first worker, d is the difference (amount of corn) between two consecutive workers. So this is the solution:
1st worker = 10/6 measures of corn
2nd worker = 65/6 measures of corn
3rd worker = 120/6 (20) measures of corn
4th worker = 175/6 measures of corn
5th worker = 230/6 measures of corn


Midnight
9 p.m.


Clock
There are a few ways of solving this one. I like the following simple way of thinking. The given situation (when the hour and minute hands overlay) occurs in 12 hours exactly 11 times after the same time. So it’s easy to figure out that 1/11 of the clock circle is at the time 1:05:27,273 and so the seconds hand is right on 27,273 seconds. There is no problem proving that the angle between the hours hand and the seconds hand is 131 degrees.


Reservoir
Because there are 24 hours in one day, in one hour fills the first tap 1/48, the second tap 1/72, the third tap 1/96 and the fourth tap fills 1/6 of the reservoir. That is all together (6+4+3+48) / 288 = 61/288. The reservoir will be full in 288/61 hours, which is 4 hours 43 minutes and about 17 seconds.


Car
There are 4 cars needed, including the car with the important letter (which travels to the middle of the desert). Its empty tank must be filled to the top to get to the end of desert. The way between the military base (where the cars and petrol is) and the middle of the desert can be divided into 3 thirds. 3 cars will go in their thirds back and forth and overspilling 1/3 of their tanks. This way the tank of the important car will be filled and the letter will be delivered.


Aeroplane
Divide the way from pole to pole to 3 thirds (from the North Pole to the South Pole 3 thirds and from the South Pole to the North Pole 3 thirds).
1.	2 aeroplanes to the first third, fuel up one aeroplane which continues to the second third and the first aeroplane goes back to the airport.
2.	2 aeroplanes fly again from the airport to the first third, fuel up one aeroplane which continues to the second third and the first aeroplane goes back to the airport.
3.	So there are 2 aeroplanes on the second third, each having 2/3 of fuel. One of them fuels up the second one and goes back to the first third, where it meets the third aeroplane which comes from the airport to support it with 1/3 of fuel so that they both can return to the airport. In the meantime, the aeroplane at the second third having full tank flies as far as it can (so over the South Pole to the last third before the airport).
4.	The rest is clear – one (of the two) aeroplane from the airport goes to the first third (the opposite direction as before), shares its 1/3 of fuel and both aeroplanes safely land back at the airport.


Belt
The original length of belt was 96 cm.


Baldyville
There can live maximum of 518 people in the town. By the way, it is clear that one inhabitant must by baldy, otherwise there wouldn’t be a single man in the town.


Josephine
The two questions for scroll #1 were:
1. How many husbands were shot on that fateful night?
2. Why is Queen Henrietta I revered in Mamajorca?
The answers are:
If there are n unfaithful husbands (UHs), every wife of an UH knows of n-1 UH's while every wife of a faithful husband knows of n UHs. [this because everyone has perfect information about everything except the fidelity of their own husband]. Now we do a simple induction: Assume that there is only one UH. Then all the wives but one know that there is just one UH, but the wife of the UH thinks that everyone is faithful. Upon hearing that "there is at least one UH", the wife realizes that the only husband it can be is her own, and so shoots him. Now, imagine that there are just two UH's. Each wife of an UH assumes that the situation is "only one UH in town" and so waits to hear the other wife (she knows who it is, of course) shoot her husband on the first night. When no one is shot, that can only be because her OWN husband was a second UH. The wife of the second UH makes the same deduction when no shot is fired the first night (she was waiting, and expecting the other to shoot, too). So they both figure it out after the first night, and shoot their husbands the second night. It is easy to tidy up the induction to show that the n UHs will all be shot just on the n'th midnight.


Why 1 = 2
The equation is solved the right way, apart from one little detail. There must be stated that x does not equal y, because there would be dividing by zero, which is not defined in maths.


Open Polygon




LOGIC PUZZLES III.

Pears
At first, there were 2 pears on the tree. After the wind blew, one pear fell on the ground. So there where no pears on the tree and there were no pears on the ground.


Apples
4 kids get an apple (one apple for each one of them) and the fifth kid gets an apple with the basket still containing the apple.


Sack
Pour the lentils into the innkeeper’s sack, bind it and turn inside out. Pour in the peas. Then unbind the sack a pour the lentils back to your sack.


Marine
The marines were standing back to the edge of the ship so they were looking at each other. It does not matter where the ship is (of course it does not apply to the north and South Pole).


Ship Ladder
If the tide is raising water, then it is raising the ship on water, too. So water will reach still the first rung.


Hotel Bill
This is a nice nonsense. Each guest paid $9 because they gave $30 and they were given back $3. The manager got $25 and the difference ($2) has the bellboy. So it is nonsense to add the $2 to the $27, since the bellboy kept the $2.


Hotel
Of course, it is impossible. Into the second room should have gone the 2nd guest, because the 13th guest was waiting in room number 1.


Puzzling Prattle
The two children were so befogged over the calendar that they had started on their way to school on Sunday morning!


Twins
The two babies are two of a set of triplets.


Photograph
I am looking at my son.


One-Way Street
She was walking.


Cost of War
Add up all the injuries, and you find that 100 soldiers suffered a total of 310 injuries. That total means that, at a minimum, 100 soldiers lost 3 body parts, and 10 (the remainder when dividing 310 by 100) must have lost all 4 body parts. (In reality, as many as 70 may have lost all 4 body parts.) 


Bavarian
There is exactly as much tonic in the glass of fernet as there is fernet in the glass of tonic.


Just in Time
The letter m.

•	No, it is not legal to get married if you are dead.
•	The bear is white since the house is built on the North Pole.
•	If you take 2 apples, than you have of course 2.
•	The dog can run into the woods only to the half of the wood – than it would run out of the woods.

TRUTH AND LIE 
(LOGIC PROBLEMS)

Honestants and Swindlecants I.
It is impossible that any inhabitant of such an island says: „I am a liar.“ An honestant would thus be lying and a swindlecant would be speaking truth. So B must have been lying and therefore he is a swindlecant. And that means that C was right saying B is lying – so C is an honestant. However, it is not clear what is A.


Honestants and Swindlecants II.
Logical disjunction is a statement "P or Q". Such a disjunction is false if both P and Q are false. In all other cases it is true. Note that in everyday language, use of the word "or" can sometimes mean "either, but not both" (e.g., "would you like tea or coffee?"). In logic, this is called an "exclusive disjunction" or "exclusive or" (xor).
So if A was a swindlecant, then his statement would be false (thus A would have to be an honestant and B would have to be a swindlecant). However, that would cause a conflict which implicates that A must be an honestant. In that case at least one part of his statement is true and as it can’t be the first one, B must be an honestant, too.


Honestants and Swindlecants III.
There are a few types of questions:
1.	Indirect question: „Hey you, what would the other guard say, if I asked him where this door leads?“ The answer is always negated.
2.	Tricky question: „Hey you, does an honestant stand at the door to freedom?“ The answer will be YES, if I am asking an honestant who is standing at the door to freedom, or if I am asking a swindlecant standing again at the same door. So I can walk through the door. A similar deduction can be made for negative answer.
3.	Complicated question: „Hey you, what would you say, if I asked you ...?“ An honestant is clear, but a swindlecant should lie. However, he is forced by the question to lie two times and thus speak the truth.


Honestants and Swindlecants IV.
The first one must be a swindlecant (otherwise he would bring himself into a liar paradox), and so (knowing that the first one is lying) there must be at least one honestant among them. If the second one is lying, then (as the first one stated) the third one is an honestant, but that would make the second one speak the truth. So the second one is an honestant and C is a swindlecant.


Honestants and Swindlecants V.
It is important to explore the statement as a whole. Truth table of any implication is as follows:

P	Q	P=>Q
truth	truth	truth
truth	lie	lie
lie	truth	truth
lie	lie	truth

In this logical conditional („if-then“ statement) p is a hypothesis (or antecedent) and q is a conclusion (or consequent). 
It is obvious, that the husband is not a Swindlecant, because in that case one part of the statement (Q) „ ... then I am Swindlecant.“ would have to be a lie, which is a conflict. And since A is an Honestant, the whole statement is true.
If his wife was an Honestant too, then the second part of statement (Q) „ ... then I am Swindlecant.“ would have to be true, which is a conflict again. Therefore the man is an Honestant and his wife is a Swindlecant.


Honestants and Swindlecants VI.
This one seems not clear to me. However, the bartender and the man sitting next to the gringo must be one honestant and one swindlecant (not knowing who is who).


Honestants and Swindlecants VII.
It is important to explore the statement as a whole. Truth table of any logical equivalence is as follows:

P	Q	P<=>Q
truth	truth	truth
truth	lie	lie
lie	truth	lie
lie	lie	truth

If the man is an Honestant, then the whole statement must be true. One part of it, where he said that he is an honest man is true then and so the other part (about the treasure) must be true, too. However, if he is a Swindlecant, the whole statement is a lie. The part mentioning that he is an honest man is in that case of course a lie. Thus the other part must be truth. So there must be a treasure on the island, no matter what kind of man said the sentence.


Honestants and Swindlecants VIII.
The important thing was what we did not need to know. So if we knew how many people lied we would know the answer. And one more thing – B and D said the same.
If all of them lied, there would be 4 possible days to choose from (which one is not clear).
If only one of them spoke the truth, it could be A or C, so 2 possible days (not clear again).
If two of them were honest, it would have to be B and D saying that it was Saturday.
Neither 3 nor all 4 could have been honest because of an obvious conflict.
So it was Saturday.


Honestants and Swindlecants IX.
If the aborigine answered „Yes.”, the gringo would not have been able to identify them. That means, the answer had to be „No.“, and the one who said that was a liar and the other one was an honest man.


Honestants and Swindlecants X.
„I am a poor swindlecant.“ An honestant can not say such a sentence, so it is a lie. And that’s why only a rich swindlecant can say that.
„I am not a poor honestant.“ A swindlecant can not say that, because it would be true. And that’s why an honestant who is not poor (a rich one) said that.


At the Court I.
Yes, the statement helped him. If he is an honestant, then a swindlecant committed the crime. If he is a swindlecant, then his statement points to an honestant who is guilty. Thus he is again innocent regarding the statement.


At the Court II.
The statement of plaintiff is a lie only if the hypothesis (or antecedent) is true and conclusion (or consequent) is not true. So the solicitor did not help his client at all. He actually said that his client was guilty and there was no accomplice.


At the Court III.
?	„I did it – I am guilty.“
?	There is no such sentence.
?	„I am innocent.“
?	„Either I am an honestant and innocent, or I am a swindlecant and guilty.“ = „I am either an innocent honestant, or a guilty swindlecant.“ The court could think this way:
?	If he is an honestant, then his statement is true and he is innocent.
?	If he is a swindlecant, then his statement is a lie and he is neither an innocent honestant nor a guilty swindlecant. This means that he is an innocent swindlecant.
?	If he is normal, then he is innocent since a normal man couldn’t have done that.


Pandora's Box I.
The given conditions indicate that only the inscription on the lead box is true. So the ring is in the silver box.


Pandora's Box II.
The ring must be in the golden box, otherwise all the inscriptions would be either true or false.


Lion and Unicorn I.
As there is no day when both of the beings would be lying, at least one of them must have spoken the truth. They both speak the truth only on Sunday. However, the Lion would then be lying in his statement, so it couldn’t be said on Sunday. So exactly one of them lied.
If the Unicorn was honest, then it would have to be Sunday – but previously we proved this wrong. Thus only the Lion spoke the truth when he met Alice on Thursday and spoke with the Unicorn about Wednesday.


Lion and Unicorn II.
This conjunction is true only if both parts are true. The first part is true only on Thursday, but the second part is a lie then (Sunday is not a lying day of the Lion). So the whole statement is not true (at least one part is not true) and could be said only on a lying day. Since the second part is a lie on any lying day, the Lion could have made the statement on Monday, on Tuesday and even on Wednesday.


Island Baal
Conjunction used by A is true only if both parts are true. Under the assumption that B is an honest man, then A would be honest too (B says so) and so B would be a liar as A said, which would be a conflict. So B is a liar. And knowing that, B actually said that A is a liar, too. First statement of A is thus a lie and B is not a lying monkey. However, B is lying which means he is not a monkey. B is a lying man. The second statement of A indicates that A is a monkey – so A is a lying monkey.


Truth, Lie and Wisdom
Let’s assign a letter to each goddess. We get these sentences.
1.	A says: B is Truth.
2.	B says: I am Wisdom.
3.	C says: B is Lie.
First sentence hints that A is not Truth. Second sentence is not said by Truth either, so C is Truth. Thus the third sentence is true. B is Lie and A is Wisdom.


In the Alps
The only one who is lying for sure is Philip. Hans speaks probably the truth and Emanuel lies. It can be also the other way, but since Hans expressed himself before Emanuel did, then Emanuel’s remark (that he does not know whether Hans is lying) is not true.


Coins
"You will give me neither copper nor silver coin." If it is true, then I have to get the gold coin. If it is a lie, then the negation must be true, so "you give me either copper or silver coin", which would break the given conditions that you get no coin when lying. So the first sentence must be true.


Slim Lover
You could say for instance this sentence: „You will give me neither your photo nor a kiss.“




OVERSPILLING, WEIGHING, MEASUREMENT

Overspilling Water I.
Fill the 5-litre bowl and overspill water to the 3-litre bowl, which you empty afterwards. From the 5-litre bowl overspill the 2 remaining litres to the 3-litre bowl. Refill the 5-litre bowl and fill in the 3-litre bowl (with 1 litre), so there stay the 4 required litres in the 5-litre bowl.


Overspilling Water II.
1.	pour 5 litres from the 8-litre to the 5-litre bowl,
2.	pour 3 litres from the 5-litre to the 3-litre bowl,
3.	pour these 3 litres back to the 8-litre bowl,
4.	pour the remaining 2 litres from the 5-litre to the 3-litre bowl,
5.	pour 5 litres from the 8-litre to the 5-litre bowl,
6.	pour the missing 1 litre from the 5-litre to the 3-litre bowl (there should be 4 litres left in the 5-litre bowl),
7.	pour the 3 litres back from the 3-litre to the 8-litre bowl (and that’s it – in 8-litre bowl 4 litres).


Overspilling Water III.
Three numerals in each number stand for litres in each bowl:
700 - 340 - 313 - 610 - 601 - 241 - 223 (overspilling 6 times)


Overspilling Water IV.
First fill the 9-litre bowl. Then overspill 4 litres to the 4-litre bowl (there are 5 litres in the 9-litre bowl afterwards) and pour out the water from the 4-litre bowl. And again overspill 4 litres to the 4-litre bowl and empty it. Then overspill the remaining litre to the 4-litre bowl but this time keep it there. Fill the 9-litre bowl to the top for the second time and overspill water to fill the 4-litre bowl to the top. Thus the required 6 litres stay in the 9-litre bowl.


Overspilling Water V.
1.	Fill the 5-litre bowl, overspill water from it to fill the 4-litre bowl, which you empty afterwards. Overspill the remaining 1 litre to the 4-litre bowl. Refill the 5-litre bowl and overspill water from it to fill the 4-litre bowl (where there is already 1 litre). Thus you are left with 2 litres in the 5-litre bowl.
2.	The same principle – this time from the other end. Fill the 3-litre bowl and overspill all of the water to the 4-litre bowl. Refill the 3-litre bowl and fill the 4-litre bowl to the top. And there you have 2 litres in the 3-litre bowl.


Overspilling Water VI.
1.	Pour 1 litre from bowl A to bowl C. Thus 4 litres are left in the bowl A and bowl C is full (3 litres).
2.	Pour 2 litres from bowl C to bowl B. Doing that you have full bowl B (5 litres) and there is 1 litre left in bowl C.


Weighing I.
If there is only 1 bag with forgeries, then take 1 coin from the first bag, 2 coins from the second bag ... ten coins from the tenth bag and weigh the picked coins. Find out how many grams does it weigh and compare it to the ideal state of having all original coins. The amount of grams (the difference) is the place of the bag with fake coins.
If there is more than 1 bag with forgeries, then there is lots of possible solution. I can offer you this one as an example: 1, 2, 4, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500 and 1000.


Weighing II.
Spike uses 51 gummy drop bears: from the 7 boxes he takes respectively 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, and 24 bears. 
The notion is that each box of imitation bears will subtract its number of bears from the total "ideal" weight of 510 grams (1 gram of missing weight per bear), so Spike weighs the bears, subtracts the result from 510 to obtain a number N, and finds the unique combination of 3 numbers from the above list (since there are 3 "imitation" boxes) that sum to N. 
The trick is for the sums of all triples selected from the set S of numbers of bears to be unique. To accomplish this, I put numbers into S one at a time in ascending order, starting with the obvious choice, 0. (Why is this obvious? If I'd started with k > 0, then I could have improved on the resulting solution by subtracting k from each number) Each new number obviously had to be greater than any previous, because otherwise sums are not unique, but also the sums it made when paired with any previous number had to be distinct from all previous pairs (otherwise when this pair is combined with a third number you can't distinguish it from the other pair)--except for the last box, where we can ignore this point. And most obviously all the new triples had to be distinct from any old triples; it was easy to find what the new triples were by adding the newest number to each old sum of pairs. 
Now, in case you're curious, the possible weight deficits and their unique decompositions are: 
3       = 0 + 1 + 2
5       = 0 + 1 + 4
6       = 0 + 2 + 4
7       = 1 + 2 + 4
8       = 0 + 1 + 7
9       = 0 + 2 + 7
10      = 1 + 2 + 7
11      = 0 + 4 + 7
12      = 1 + 4 + 7
13      = 2 + 4 + 7
14      = 0 + 1 + 13
15      = 0 + 2 + 13
16      = 1 + 2 + 13
17      = 0 + 4 + 13
18      = 1 + 4 + 13
19      = 2 + 4 + 13
20      = 0 + 7 + 13
21      = 1 + 7 + 13
22      = 2 + 7 + 13
24      = 4 + 7 + 13
25      = 0 + 1 + 24

Note that there had to be (7 choose 3) distinct values; they end up ranging from 3 to 44 inclusive with 7 numbers missing: 4, 23, 34, 36, 40, 42, and 43. 


Weighing III.
Similar to the former brain teaser.
I take out 0 (no coin from the first bag), 1 (one coin from the second bag etc.), 2, 4, 7, 13, 24, 44 coins (from the last 8th bag). Each triple is unique enabling an easy way to identify the bags with fake coins (using only 95 coins).


Weighing IV.
It is enough to use the pair of scales just 3 times. Let’s mark the balls using numbers from 1 to 12 and these special symbols:
x? means I know nothing about ball number x;
x< means that this ball is maybe lighter then the others;
x> means that this ball is maybe heavier then the others;
x. means this ball is “normal”.
At first, I lay on the left pan balls 1? 2? 3? 4? and on the right pan balls 5? 6? 7? 8?.
If there is equilibrium, then the wrong ball is among balls 9-12. I put 1. 2. 3. on the left and 9? 10? 11? on the right pan.
If there is equilibrium, then the wrong ball is number 12 and comparing it with another ball I find out if it is heavier or lighter.
If the left pan is heavier, I know that 12 is normal and 9< 10< 11<. I weigh 9< and 10<. 
If they are the same weight, then ball 11 is lighter then all other balls.
If they are not the same weight, then the lighter ball is the one up.
If the right pan is heavier, then 9> 10> and 11> and the procedure is similar to the former text.
If the left pan is heavier, then 1> 2> 3> 4>, 5< 6< 7< 8< and 9. 10. 11. 12. Now I lay on the left pan 1> 2> 3> 5< and on the right pan 4> 9. 10. 11.
If there is equilibrium, then the suspicious balls are 6< 7< and 8<. Identifying the wrong one is similar to the former case of 9< 10< 11<
If the left pan is lighter, then the wrong ball can be 5< or 4>. I compare for instance 1. and 4>. If they weigh the same, then ball 5 is lighter the all the others. Otherwise ball 4 is heavier (is down). 
If the left pan is heavier, then all balls are normal except for 1> 2> and 3>. Identifying the wrong ball among 3 balls was described earlier.


Weighing V.
Lay one red and one white ball on left pan and one blue and the other white ball on the right pan. If there is equilibrium, then it is clear that there is one heavier and one lighter ball on each side. That’s why comparing white balls is enough to learn everything.
However, if at first weighing one side is heavier, then there must be a heavier white ball on that side. The next reasonable step is to compare the already weighed red ball and yet not weighed blue ball. After that, the character of each ball is clear, isn’t it?


Weighing VI.
Divide the 9 balls into 3 groups of 3. Weigh two groups. Thus you find out which group is the heavier ball in. Choose 2 balls from this group and compare their weights. And that's it.


Weighing VII.
It is enough to use a pair of scales 3 times.
Divide the 27 balls to 3 groups, 9 balls in each. Compare 2 groups – the heavier one contains the ball. If there is equilibrium, then the ball is in the third group. Thus we know the 9 suspicious balls.
Divide the 9 balls to 3 groups of 3. Compare 2 groups, and as mentioned above, identify the group of 3 suspicious balls.
Compare 2 balls (of the 3 possibly heavier ones) and you know everything.
So we used a pair of scales 3 times to identify the heavier ball.


Weighing VIII.
There are necessary at least 5 weights to bring into balance any of the 121 possible objects. And they weigh as follows: 1, 3, 9, 27, 81g.


Sand-Glass I.
Turn both sand-glasses. After 4 minutes turn upside down the 4-min sand-glass. When the 7-min sand-glass spills the last grain, turn the 7-min upside down. Then you have 1 minute in the 4-min sand-glass left and after spilling everything, in the 7-min sand-glass there will be 1 minute of sand down (already spilt). Turn the 7-min sand-glass upside down and let the 1 minute go back. And that's it. 4+3+1+1


Sand-Glass II.
When the test began, the teacher turned both 7min and 4min sand-glasses. After the 7min one spilt its last grain, he turned it upside down (the 11min one are still to spill grain for another 4 minutes). When the 11min sand-glass was spilt, he turned the 7min one upside down for the last time. And that’s it.


Igniter Cords
Start fire on both ends of one igniter cord and on one end of the second igniter cord. The very moment the first cord (where both ends burn) stops burning (that is after 30 minutes), start fire on the other end of the second cord (otherwise it would burn another 30 minutes). Thus the second igniter cord burns just 15 minutes from then. And that is all together 45 minutes.



EINSTEIN’S RIDDLES

Bear
It all happened on the North Pole. When the man shot, he must have been right on the North Pole. Getting it? So it makes sense to assume that the only color the bear could be was WHITE. 
So this is it. I've heard another logical solutions (even that there are no bears neither on the North nor on the South Pole), but this one presented makes sense to me. And what about you?

NUMBER PUZZLES

Easy Savoury
None of the students can have numbers 1 or 10, since they would guess the other one’s number with no problems. I will describe solutions at one end of the interval of numbers 1-10 (the same can be done on the other end).
Information that the second student does not know must be important for the first student. So the first one must expect that the second one has 1 or 3 (if the first one has 2). And as the second student does not know, then he has certainly not 1. So the first pair is 2 and 3.
If the first one had 3, then he would expect the other one to have either 2 or 4. But if the second one had 2 (and the second one would have known that the first one does not have 1), then he would know the number of the first student. However, neither the second student knows the answer – so he has 4. The second pair of numbers is 3 and 4.
Solutions at the other end of interval are 9 and 8 or 8 and 7.


Savoury
The numbers were 2 and 9. Why? Try to think about it ?.


Children
Let’s start with the known product – 36. Write on a sheet of paper the possible combinations giving the product of 36. Knowing that the sum is not enough to be sure, there are two possible combinations with the same sum (1-6-6 a 2-2-9). And as we learned further that the oldest son wears a hat, it is clear that the correct combination of ages is 2-2-9, where there is exactly one of them the oldest one.

Fraction

5-Digit Number
Using an easy equation: 3(x+100000) = 10x+1 we find out that the number is 42857.


9-Digit Number
473816952 – if rounding changes the next numeral character


10-Digit Number
?	Sum of all numerals must be ten because each numeral stands for the count of other numerals and because this number shall have ten numerals. Beginning to choose reasonable numerals for the first figure you can come across the correct number: 6210001000.
?	2100010006.


Cipher
The possible 2 last numerals are as follows: 03, 05, 07, 09, 14, 16, 18, 25, 27, 29 and 30. At least two multiples less than 100 (this condition is already accomplished), which consist of even and odd numeral (respecting all other conditions) are for 03, 07, 09 and 18 as follows:
03 – 27, 63, 69, 81
07 – 49, 63
09 – 27, 63, 81
18 – 36, 72, 90
There are 5 numbers that can be made of these pairs of numerals to create the cipher: 692703, 816903, 496307, 816309 and 903618. (If we assume, that also in the number 903618 is accomplished the requirement to alternate even and odd numbers, despite the opposite order.)


The Puzzle
This one is not verified – I used 2 numbers 39543 and 89398. And this is what the grid looks like:

8	9	3	9	8
9		9		9
3	9	5	4	3
9		4		9
8	9	3	9	8

So the total score is 147.

CROSSING RIVER AND OTHERS

She-goat, Wolf and Cabbage
Take the she-goat to the other side. Go back, take cabbage, unload it on the other side where you load the she-goat, go back and unload it. Take the wolf to the other side where you unload it. Go back for the she-goat. That's it.


Cannibals and Missionaries
1 cannibal and 1 missionary there, missionary back. 2 cannibals there, 1 cannibal back. 2 missionaries there, 1 missionary and 1 cannibal back. 2 missionaries there, 1 cannibal back. This one cannibal takes the remaining cannibals to the other side.

Family
First go the children. Son comes back, and father goes on the other side to his daughter. Then daughter goes back to pick her brother up and they both go to the other side to the father. Son comes back to give the boat to mother who goes to the other side (to father and daughter). Daughter jumps in and goes to her brother so they can both return to their parents. Daughter gets off and son gives the boat back on the first side of the river to the fisherman, who goes on the other side. There the daughter jumps in and goes to her brother to take him back to parents where she (where the whole family meets at last) returns the boat to the fisherman. The boat crossed the river 13 times.

Dark Phobia
First mom and dad – 2 minutes. Dad comes back – 3 minutes, both children go to mom – 8 minutes. Mom comes to dad – 10 minutes and they both get to their children – 12 minutes.


Condoms
1.	Use both condoms on the first woman.  Take off the outer condom (turning it inside-out in the process) and set it aside.  Use the inner condom alone on the second woman.  Put the outer condom back on.  Use it on the third woman.
2.	First man takes both condoms (c1 and c2), makes love to the first woman, takes off c2 and passes it on to the second man, who pleases the first woman, too. First man does it to the second woman using c1 and afterwards he takes c1 off and the second man stretches c1 over c2 and ...
3.	First man uses both condoms.  Take off the outer condom (do NOT reverse it) and have second man use it.  First man takes off the inner condom (turning it inside-out).  Third man puts on this condom, followed by second man's condom.


Flowers
There are 2 solutions: 
Three flowers: rose, tulip, daisy.
Two flowers: carnation, geranium.


Subtraction
Once. After you subtract 2 from 32, you subtract 2 from 30, from 28, and so on. 


Round vs. Square
You can turn a square manhole cover sideways and drop it down the diagonal of the manhole. You cannot drop a round manhole cover down the manhole. Therefore, round manhole covers are safer and more practical than square ones. 


The Barbershop Puzzle
The traveler goes to have his hair cut at the barbershop on East Street. He figures that since there are only two barbershops in town the East Street barber must have his hair cut by the West Street barber and vice versa. So if the traveler wants to look as good as the West Street barber (the one with the good haircut), he'd better go to the man who cuts the West Street barber's hair - the East Street barber. 
By the way, the reason the West Street barbershop is so clean and neat is that it seldom gets customers. 


Murder in the Desert
Well, this is a hard one. In my opinion, there is no clear solution. Each point of view is correct, somehow. Most of the people would say that A is the murderer. Solicitor of B would stress 2 things:
1. to take away poisoned water from someone does not mean killing him,
2. B just made C live longer, even if he did not mean to (the poison might have killed C earlier).
However, solicitor of A could present the following argument:
"How can be A be punished for committing a murder by poisoning C, if C did not swallow a single drop of poison."
Raymond M. Smullyan pointed out the moral, legal and logical point of view. It is morally clear that both A and B are guilty of homicide attempt. Legally, 2 different courts could judge them in 2 different ways. And logic gives us the opportunity to write a whole book on this topic.


The Elder Twin
At the time she went into labor, the mother of the twins was travelling by boat. The older twin, Terry, was born first early on March 1st. The boat then crossed the International Date line (or any time zone line) and Kerry, the younger twin, was born on February the 28th. In a leap year the younger twin celebrates her birthday two days before her older brother. 
This puzzle was submitted to Games Magazine's 'How Come' competition in 1992 by Judy Dean. It won.
