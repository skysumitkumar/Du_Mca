<ul><i><font color="#000080">The suggested collection of mathematical folklore
might be enjoyable for mathematicians and for students because every joke
contains a portion of truth or lie about our profession. The selected jokes
and sayings contain something essential about mathematics, the mathematical
way of thinking, or mathematical pop-culture.</font></i>
<br><i><font color="#000080">We have slightly edited and systematized selected
jokes, and added a few new ones.</font></i>
<p><i><font color="#000080">We are concerned that publication of sacral
lecture jokes may endanger the respect to math. teachers in freshmen classes.
Our excuse for this risky ethnographic research is that the majority of
the jokes already exists on the Internet.</font></i>
<p><i><font color="#000080">Sometimes, people tend to attribute the jokes
either to their beloved teachers (Peter Lax is so far the champion) or
to&nbsp; legendary figures as Norbert Wiener or Paul Erdos; similarly,
physical jokes are attributed to Albert Einstein or Niels Bohr and geometrical
theorems - to Euclid. A number of collected jokes we learned from our professors
in Saint-Petersburg. Generally,&nbsp; attributing the jokes is hopeless.
Indeed, the phrasing of the narrator is as important as the essence of
the humor (if this essence does exist at all). To our mind, a joke goes
to&nbsp; "public domain" immediately after being created or modified and
there should be no authorship in it.&nbsp; Most of the collected sayings
and jokes are repeated in a number of webpages, which makes it difficult
to credit a particular Internet source. Instead, we thank all Internet
collectors of math. jokes.</font></i>

<br><i><font color="#000080">Let's start with general definitions.</font></i>
<ul>
<hr>
<p>Mathematics is made of 50 percent formulas, 50 percent proofs, and 50
percent imagination.&nbsp;
<hr>
<p>"A mathematician is a device for turning coffee into theorems" (P. Erdos)
<br>Addendum: American coffee is good for lemmas.&nbsp;
<hr>
<p>An engineer thinks that his equations are an approximation to reality.
A physicist thinks reality is an approximation to his equations. A mathematician
doesn't care.&nbsp;
<hr>
<p>Old mathematicians never die; they just lose some of their functions.&nbsp;
<hr>
<p>Mathematicians are like Frenchmen: whatever you say to them, they translate
it into their own language, and forthwith it means something entirely different.
-- Goethe&nbsp;
<hr>
<p>
Mathematics is the art of giving the same name to different things.
	-- J. H. Poincare
<hr>
<p>

What is a rigorous definition of rigor?&nbsp;
<hr>
<p>There is no logical foundation of mathematics, and G&ouml;del has proved
it!&nbsp;
<hr>
<p>I do not think -- therefore I am not.
<p><i><font color="#000080">Here is the illustration of this principle:</font></i>
<br>One evening Rene Descartes went to relax at a local tavern. The tender
approached and said, "Ah, good evening Monsieur Descartes! Shall I serve
you the usual drink?". Descartes replied, "I think not.", and promptly
vanished.&nbsp;
<hr>
<p>A topologist is a person who doesn't know the difference between a coffee
cup and a doughnut.&nbsp;
<hr>
<p>
A mathematician is a blind man in a dark room looking for a
black cat which isn't there. (Charles R Darwin)
<hr>
<p>   A statistician is someone who is good with numbers but
lacks the personality to be an  accountant.
<hr>
<p>
Classification of mathematical problems as linear and nonlinear is like
classification of the Universe as bananas and non-bananas.&nbsp;
<hr>
<p>A law of conservation of difficulties: there is no easy way to prove
a deep result.&nbsp;
<hr>
<p>A tragedy of mathematics is a beautiful conjecture ruined by an ugly
fact.<hr>
<p>Algebraic symbols are used when you do not know what you are talking
about.&nbsp;
<hr>
<p>Philosophy is a game with objectives and no rules.
<br>Mathematics is a game with rules and no objectives.&nbsp;
<hr>
<p>Math is like love; a simple idea, but it can get complicated.
<hr>
<p><i><font color="#000099">The actual quote from the Webster dictionary:</font></i>
<br>trillion n
<br>syn SCAD, gob(s), heap, jillion, load(s), million, oodles, quantities,
thousand, wad(s)&nbsp;
<hr>
<p>Mathematics is like checkers in being suitable for the young, not too
difficult, amusing, and without peril to the state. (Plato)
<hr>
<p>The difference between an introvert and extrovert mathematicians is:
An introvert mathematician looks at his shoes while talking to you. An
extrovert mathematician looks at your shoes.&nbsp;
<hr>
<p><i><font color="#000080">A bit of theology.&nbsp;</font></i>
<hr>
<p>Math is the language God used to write the universe.&nbsp;
<hr>
<p>Asked if he believes in one God, a mathematician answered:
<br>" Yes, up to isomorphism."&nbsp;
<hr>
<p>God is real, unless proclaimed integer.  
<hr>

<p>Medicine makes people ill, mathematics make them sad and theology makes
them sinful. (Martin Luther)&nbsp;
<hr>
<p>The good Christian should beware of mathematicians and all those who
make empty prophecies. The danger already exists that mathematicians have
made a covenant with the devil to darken the spirit and confine man in
the bonds of Hell. (St. Augustine)&nbsp;
<hr>
<p>He who can properly define and divide is to be considered a god. (Plato)&nbsp;
<hr>
<p>"God geometrizes" says Plato.
<p><i><font color="#000080">and here is the analytical continuation of
this saying:</font></i>
<ul>Biologists think they are biochemists,
<br>Biochemists think they are Physical Chemists,
<br>Physical Chemists think they are Physicists,

<p><b><font size=+1>2. A mathematician and ...</font></b>
<br><i><font color="#000080">The following sketches show our dedication
to abstract thinking in the most unusual situations and&nbsp; strong belief
in the universality of mathematical methods. Mathematicians are always
impatient and intelligent.</font></i>
<ul>
<hr>
<p>A mathematician and a Wall street broker went to races. The broker suggested
to bet $10,000 on a horse. The mathematician was sceptical, saying that
he wanted first to understand the rules, to look on horses, etc. The broker
whispered that he knew a secret algorithm for the success, but he could
not convince the mathematician.
<br>"You are too theoretical," he said and bet on a horse. Surely, that
horse came first bringing him a lot of money. Triumphantly, he exclaimed:
<br>"I told you, I knew the secret!"
<br>"What is your secret?" the mathematician asked.
<br>"It is rather easy. I have two kids, three and five year old. I sum
up their ages and I bet on number nine."
<br>"But, three and five is eight," the mathematician protested.
<br>"I told you, you are too theoretical!" the broker replied, "Haven't
I just shown experimentally, that my calculation is correct! 3+5=9!"&nbsp;
<hr>
<p>A mathematician, a physicist, an engineer went again to the races and
laid their money down. Commiserating in the bar after the race, the engineer
says, "I don't understand why I lost all my money. I measured all the horses
and calculated their strength and mechanical advantage and figured out
how fast they could run..."
<p>The physicist interrupted him: "...but you didn't take individual variations
into account. I did a statistical analysis of their previous performances
and bet on the horses with the highest probability of winning..."
<p>"...so if you're so hot why are you broke?" asked the engineer. But
before the argument can grow, the mathematician takes out his pipe and
they get a glimpse of his well-fattened wallet. Obviously here was a man
who knows something about horses. They both demanded to know his secret.
<p>"Well," he says, "first I assumed all the horses were identical and
spherical..."&nbsp;
<hr>
<p>An engineer, a physicist and a mathematician are staying in a hotel.
<br>The engineer wakes up and smells smoke. He goes out into the hallway
and sees a fire, so he fills a trash can from his room with water and douses
the fire. He goes back to bed.
<br>Later, the physicist wakes up and smells smoke. He opens his door and
sees a fire in the hallway. He walks down the hall to a fire hose and after
calculating the flame velocity, distance, water pressure, trajectory, etc.
extinguishes the fire with the minimum amount of water and energy needed.
<br>Later, the mathematician wakes up and smells smoke. He goes to the
hall, sees the fire and then the fire hose. He thinks for a moment and
then exclaims, "Ah, a solution exists!" and then goes back to bed.&nbsp;
<hr>
<p>A physicist and a mathematician are sitting in a faculty lounge. Suddenly,
the coffee machine catches on fire. The physicist grabs a bucket and leap
towards the sink, filled the bucket with water and puts out the fire. Second
day, the same two sit in the same lounge. Again, the coffee machine catches
on fire. This time, the mathematician stands up, got a bucket, hands the
bucket to the physicist, thus reducing the problem to a previously solved
one.
<ul><i><font color="#000080">Another version:</font></i></ul>
A mathematician and an engineer are on desert island. They find two palm
trees with one coconut each. The engineer climbs up one tree, gets the coconut,
eats. The mathematician climbs up the other tree, gets the coconut, climbs
the other tree and puts it there. "Now we've reduced it to a problem we
know how to solve."&nbsp;
<hr>
<p>A biologist, a physicist and a mathematician were sitting in a street
cafe watching the crowd. Across the street they saw a man and a woman entering
a building. Ten minutes they reappeared together with a third person.
<br>- They have multiplied, said the biologist.
<br>- Oh no, an error in measurement, the physicist sighed.
<br>- If exactly one person enters the building now, it will be empty again,
the mathematician concluded.&nbsp;
<hr>
<p>Several scientists were all posed the following question: "What is 2
* 2 ?"
<br>The engineer whips out his slide rule (so it's old) and shuffles it
back and forth, and finally announces "3.99".
<br>The physicist consults his technical references, sets up the problem
on his computer, and announces "it lies between 3.98 and 4.02".
<br>The mathematician cogitates for a while, then announces: "I don't know
what the answer is, but I can tell you, an answer exists!".
<br>Philosopher smiles: "But what do you mean by 2 * 2 ?"
<br>Logician replies: "Please define 2 * 2 more precisely."&nbsp;
<br>The sociologist: "I don't know, but is was nice talking about it".  
<br>Behavioral Ecologist: "A polygamous mating system".     
<br>Medical Student : "4"                                                     
All others looking astonished : "How did you know ??"                         
Medical Student : :I memorized it."

<p>

A physicist, a mathematician, and a mystic were asked to name      
the greatest invention of all time.  The physicist chose the fire, 
which gave humanity the power over matter. 
The mathematician chose the alphabet, which      
gave humanity power over symbols. The mystic chose the thermos bottle.        
<br>"Why a thermos bottle?" the others asked.                                   <br>    
"Because the thermos keeps hot liquids hot in winter and cold liquids cold 
in summer."  
<br>
"Yes -- so what?"  <br>
"Think about it." said the mystic reverently. That little bottle -- how 
does it *know*?" 



<ul><i><font color="#000080">At least this time we are together with the physicist!  :</font></i></ul>



<hr>
<p>An chemist, a physicist, and a mathematician are stranded on an island
when a can of food rolls ashore. The chemist and the physicist comes up
with many ingenious ways to open the can. Then suddenly the mathematician
gets a bright idea: "Assume we have a can opener ..."&nbsp;
<hr>
<p>A mathematician is asked to design a table. He first designs a table
with no legs. Then he designs a table with infinitely many legs. He spend
the rest of his life generalizing the results for the table with <b>N</b>
legs (where <b>N</b> is not necessarily a natural number).&nbsp;
<hr>
<p>Several scientists were all posed the following question: "What is pi
?"
<br>The engineer said: "It is approximately 3 and 1/7"
<br>The physicist said: "It is 3.14159"
<br>The mathematician thought a bit, and replied "It is equal to pi".&nbsp;
<p>(A nutritionist: &quot;Pie is a healthy and delicious dessert!&quot; )<hr>
<p>An engineer, a physicist and a mathematician were asked to hammer a
nail into a wall.
<br>The engineer went to build a Universal Automatic Nailer -- a device
able to hammer every possible nail into every possible wall.
<br>The physicist conducted series of experiments on strength of hammers,
nails, and walls and developed a revolutionary technology of ultra-sonic
nail hammering at super-low temperature.
<br>The mathematician generalized the problem to a N dimensional problem
of penetration of a knotted one dimensional nail into a N-1 dimensional
hyper-wall. Several fundamental theorems are proved. Of course, the problem
is too rich to suggest a possibility of a simple solution, even the existence
of a solution is far from obvious.&nbsp;
<hr>
<p>A mathematician, a physicist, and an engineer were traveling through
Scotland when they saw a black sheep through the window of the train.
<br>"Aha," says the engineer, "I see that Scottish sheep are black."
<br>"Hmm," says the physicist, "You mean that some Scottish sheep are black."
<br>"No," says the mathematician, "All we know is that there is at least
one sheep in Scotland, and that at least one side of that one sheep is
black!"&nbsp;

A mathematician, scientist, and engineer are each asked:                        
"Suppose we define a horse's tail to be a leg.  How many legs does a            horse have?"                                                                    
The mathematician answers "5"; the scientist "1"; and the engineer              
says "But you can't do that!

A mathematician, a physicist, and an engineer are all given identical
rubber balls and told to find the volume.  They are given anything
they want to measure it, and have all the time they need.

The mathematician pulls out a measuring tape and records the
circumference.  He then divides by two times pi to get the radius,
cubes that, multiplies by pi again, and then multiplies by four-thirds
and thereby calculates the volume.

The physicist gets a bucket of water, places 1.00000 gallons of water
in the bucket, drops in the ball, and measures the displacement to six
significant figures.

And the engineer?  He writes down the serial number of the ball, and
looks it up.

A Mathematician (M) and an Engineer (E) attend a lecture by a Physicist.
The topic concerns Kulza-Klein theories involving physical processes that
occur in spaces with dimensions of 9, 12 and even higher. The M is sitting,
clearly enjoying the lecture, while the E is frowning and looking generally
confused and puzzled. By the end the E has a terrible headache. At the
end, the M comments about the wonderful lecture.
<br>E: "How do you understand this stuff?"
<br>M: "I just visualize the process"
<br>E: "How can you POSSIBLY visualize something that occurs in 9-dimensional
space?"
<br>M: "Easy, first visualize it in N-dimensional space, then let N go
to 9"&nbsp;
<hr>
<p>A team of engineers were required to measure the height of a flag pole.
They only had a measuring tape, and were getting quite frustrated trying
to keep the tape along the pole. It kept falling down, etc. A mathematician
comes along, finds out their problem, and proceeds to remove the pole from
the ground and measure it easily. When he leaves, one engineer says to
the other: "Just like a mathematician! We need to know the height, and
he gives us the length!"&nbsp;
<hr>
<p>A mathematician and a physicist agree to a psychological experiment.
The (hungry) mathematician is put in a chair in a large empty room and
his favorite meal, perfectly prepared, is placed at the other end of the
room. The psychologist explains, "You are to remain in your chair. Every
minute, I will move your chair to a position halfway between its current
location and the meal." The mathematician looks at the psychologist in
disgust. "What? I'm not going to go through this. You know I'll never reach
the food!" And he gets up and storms out.
<br>The psychologist ushers the physicist in. He explains the situation,
and the physicist's eyes light up and he starts drooling. The psychologist
is a bit confused. "Don't you realize that you'll never reach the food?"
T he physicist smiles and replies: "Of course! But I'll get close enough
for all practical purposes!"&nbsp;
<hr>
<p>One day a farmer called up an engineer, a physicist, and a mathematician
and asked them to fence of the largest possible area with the least amount
of fence.
<br>The engineer made the fence in a circle and proclaimed that he had
the most efficient design.
<br>The physicist made a long, straight line and proclaimed "We can assume
the length is infinite..." and pointed out that fencing off half of the
Earth was certainly a more efficient way to do it.
<br>The Mathematician just laughed at them. He built a tiny fence around
himself and said "I declare myself to be on the outside."&nbsp;
<hr>
<p>The physicist and the engineer are in a hot-air balloon. Soon, they
find themselves lost in a canyon somewhere. They yell out for help: "Helllloooooo!
Where are we?"
<br>15 minutes later, they hear an echoing voice: "Helllloooooo! You're
in a hot-air balloon!!"
<br>The physicist says, "That must have been a mathematician."
<br>The engineer asks, "Why do you say that?"
<br>The physicist replied: "The answer was absolutely correct, and it was
utterly useless."&nbsp;
<hr>
<p>Several scientists were asked to prove that all odd integers higher
than 2 are prime.
<p>&nbsp;Mathematician: 3 is a prime, 5 is a prime, 7 is a prime, and by
induction - every odd integer higher than 2 is a prime.
<br>Physicist: 3 is a prime, 5 is a prime, 7 is a prime, 9 is an experimental
error, 11 is a prime. Just to be sure, try several randomly chosen numbers:
17 is a prime, 23 is a prime...
<br>Engineer: 3 is a prime, 5 is a prime, 7 is a prime, 9 is an approximation
to a prime, 11 is a prime,...
<br>Programmer (reading the output on the screen): 3 is a prime, 3 is a
prime, 3 a is prime, 3 is a prime....
<br>Biologist: 3 is a prime, 5 is a prime, 7 is a prime, 9 -- results have
not arrived yet,...
<br>Psychologist: 3 is a prime, 5 is a prime, 7 is a prime, 9 is a prime
but tries to suppress it,...
<br>Chemist (or Dan Quayle): What's a prime?
<br>Politician: "Some numbers are prime.. but the goal is to create a kinder,
gentler society where all numbers are prime... "
<br>Programmer: "Wait a minute, I think I have an algorithm from Knuth
on finding prime numbers... just a little bit longer, I've found the last
bug... no, that's not it... ya know, I think there may be a compiler bug
here - oh, did you want IEEE-998.0334 rounding or not? - was that in the
spec? - hold on, I've almost got it - I was up all night working on this
program, ya know... now if management would just get me that new workstation
that just came out, I'd be done by now... etc., etc. ..."

 (Two is the oddest prime of all, because it's the
only one that's even!)

<p>Dean, to the physics department. "Why do I always have to give you guys
so much money, for laboratories and expensive equipment and stuff. Why
couldn't you be like the math. department - all they need is money for
pencils, paper and waste-paper baskets. Or even better, like the philosophy
department. All they need are pencils and paper."

<hr>
<p>A mathematician, an engineer, and a chemist were walking down the road
when they saw a pile of cans of beer. Unfortunately, they were the old-fashioned
cans that do not have the tab at the top. One of them proposed that they
split up and find can openers. The chemist went to his lab and concocted
a magical chemical that dissolves the can top in an instant and evaporates
the next instant so that the beer inside is not affected. The engineer
went to his workshop and created a new HyperOpener that can open 25 cans
per second.
<p>They went back to the pile with their inventions and found the mathematician
finishing the last can of beer. "How did you manage that?" they asked in
astonishment. The mathematician answered, "Oh, well, I assumed they were
open and went from there."
<p>
<hr>
<p>An engineer, a physicist and a mathematician find themselves in an anecdote,
indeed an anecdote quite similar to many that you have no doubt already
heard. After some observations and rough calculations the engineer realizes
the situation and starts laughing. A few minutes later the physicist understands
too and chuckles to himself happily as he now has enough experimental evidence
to publish a paper.
<p>This leaves the mathematician somewhat perplexed, as he had observed
right away that he was the subject of an anecdote, and deduced quite rapidly
the presence of humor from similar anecdotes, but considers this anecdote
to be too trivial a corollary to be significant, let alone funny.

New York (CNN). At John F. Kennedy International Airport today,  a high school 
mathematics teacher was arrested trying to board a flight while in
possession of a
compass, a protractor and a graphical calculator. 
According to law enforcement officials, he is believed to have ties to the Al-Gebra 
network. He will be charged with carrying weapons of math instruction. It was later 
discovered that he taught the students to solve their problem with the help of 
radicals!

A mathematician organizes a lottery in which the prize is an infinite amount of 
money. When the winning ticket is drawn, and the jubilant winner comes to claim his 
prize, the mathematician explains the mode of payment: "1 dollar now, 1/2 dollar next 
week, 1/3 dollar the week after that..."

A
Mathematician was put  in a room.  The room contains a table and
three metal spheres about the size of a softball.  He was told to do
whatever he wants with the balls and the table in one hour.  After an
hour,  the balls are arranges
in a triangle at the center of the table.  The same
test is given to a Physicist.  After an hour, the balls
are stacked one on top of the other in the center of the table.

A mathematician decides he wants to learn more about practical
problems.  He sees a seminar with a nice title: "The Theory of Gears." 
So he goes.  The speaker stands up and begins, "The theory of gears
with a real number of teeth is well known ..."

When a statistician  passes the airport security check, they discover a bomb in 
his bag. He explains. "Statistics shows that the probability of a bomb being on an 
airplane is 1/1000.  However, the chance that there are two bombs at one plane is 
1/1000000. So, I am much safer..."

What is the difference between a Psychotic, a Neurotic and a mathematician?
A  Psychotic believes that 2+2=5. A Neurotic knows that 2+2=4, but it kills
him. A mathematician simply changes the base.

Q: What will a logician choose: a half of an egg or eternal bliss in the afterlife? 
A: A half of an egg! Because nothing is better than eternal bliss in the afterlife, 
and a half of an egg is better than nothing.

A physicist has been conducting experiments and has worked out a set of equations 
which seem to explain his data. He  asks a mathematician to check them. A week later, 
the mathematician calls 
	"I'm sorry, but your equations are complete nonsense." 
	"But these equations accurately predict results of experiments. Are you sure 
they are completely wrong?
	"To be precise, they are not always a complete nonsense. But the only case in 
which they are true is the trivial one where the field is Archimedean..."

An engineer and a  topologist were locked in the  rooms for a day  with a can of food 
but without an opener. 
At the end of the day,  the engineer is sitting on the floor of his room and eating 
from the open can: He threw it against the walls until it cracked open. 
In the mathematician's room, the can is still closed but the mathematician has 
disappeared. There are strange noises coming from inside the can... When it is opened 
and the mathematician crawls out. "Damn! I got a sign wrong..."

A mathematician has spent ten years trying to prove the Riemann hypothesis. Finally, 
he decides to sell his soul to the devil in exchange for a proof. The devil promises 
to deliver a proof in the four weeks. Half a year later, the devil shows up again - 
in a rather gloomy mood. 
"I'm sorry", he says. "I couldn't prove the hypothesis either. But" - and his face 
lightens up - "I think I found a really interesting lemma..."

1960s: A peasant sells a bag of potatoes for $10. His costs amount to 4/5
of his selling price. What is his profit?</li>

<li>
1970s: A farmer sells a bag of potatoes for $10. His costs amount to 4/5
of his selling price, that is, $8. What is his profit?</li>

<li>
1970s (new math): A farmer exchanges a set P of potatoes with set M of
money. The cardinality of the set M is equal to 10, and each element of
M is worth $1. Draw ten big dots representing the elements of M. The set
C of production costs is composed of two big dots less than the set M.
Represent C as a subset of M and give the answer to the question: What
is the cardinality of the set of profits?</li>

<li>
1980s: A farmer sells a bag of potatoes for $10. His production costs are
$8, and his profit is $2. Underline the word "potatoes" and discuss with
your classmates.</li>

<li>
1990s: A farmer sells a bag of potatoes for $10. His or her production
costs are 0.80 of his or her revenue. On your calculator, graph revenue
vs. costs. Run the POTATO program to determine the profit. Discuss the
result with students in your group. Write a brief essay that analyzes this
example in the real world of economics.</li>

<p>Two male mathematicians are in a bar. The first one says to the second
that the average person knows very little about basic mathematics. The
second one disagrees, and claims that most people can cope with a reasonable
amount of math.
<p>&nbsp;The first mathematician goes off to the washroom, and in his absence
the second calls over the waitress. He tells her that in a few minutes,
after his friend has returned, he will call her over and ask her a question.
All she has to do is answer one third x cubed.
<p>&nbsp;She repeats "one thir -- dex cue"?
<br>He repeats "one third x cubed".
<br>Her: `one thir dex cuebd'? Yes, that's right, he says. So she agrees,
and goes off mumbling to herself, "one thir dex cuebd...".
<p>&nbsp;The first guy returns and the second proposes a bet to prove his
point, that most people do know something about basic math. He says he
will ask the blonde waitress an integral, and the first laughingly agrees.
The second man calls over the waitress and asks "what is the integral of
x squared?".
<br>The waitress says "one third x cubed" and while walking away, turns
back and says over her shoulder "plus a constant!"

waitress solves the problem correctly, better than the poser. But he is

has new knowledge about English literature!
<br>"What else do you have?" asks the student.
<br>"Well, I have pills for art history, biology, and world history," replies
the pharmacist.
<br>The student asks for these, and swallows them and has new knowledge
about those subjects.
<br>Then the student asks, "Do you have a pill for math?"
<br>The pharmacist says "Wait just a moment", and goes back into the storeroom
and brings back a whopper of a pill and plunks it on the counter.

 Yeah, I used to think it was just recreational... then I started
 doin' it during the week... you know, simple stuff: differentiation,
 kinematics.  Then I got into integration by parts... I started doin'
 it every night: path integrals, holomorphic functions.  Now I'm
 on diophantine equations and sinking deeper into transfinite
 analysis.  Don't let them tell you it's just recreational.

"It's a `thank you' present", he explains, "from that freshman 
girl I've been tutoring. Yesterday she called me
 and told that she had passed her math final and 
wanted to drop by to thank me in person. She arrived at my 
place on her bicycle. When 
I had let her in, she  took all her clothes off, smiled 
at me, and said: `You can get from me whatever you desire!'" 
One of his friends remarks: "You made a really smart 
choice when you took the bicycle."

<p>A lecturer:<br>
&quot;Now we'll prove the theorem. In fact I'll prove it all by myself.&quot;<hr>
  <p><b>How to prove it. Guide for lecturers.</b>
<br>&nbsp; </p>

<p>Proof by vigorous handwaving:
<dd>
Works well in a classroom or seminar setting.</dd>

<p><br>Proof by forward reference:
<dd>
Reference is usually to a forthcoming paper of the author, which is often
not as forthcoming as at first.</dd>

<p><br>Proof by funding:
<dd>
How could three different government agencies be wrong?</dd>

<p><br>Proof by example:
<dd>
The author gives only the case n = 2 and suggests that it contains most
of the ideas of the general proof.</dd>

<p><br>Proof by omission:
<dd>
"The reader may easily supply the details" or 
"The other 253 cases are analogous"</dd>
<p>Proof by deferral:
<dd>
"We'll prove this later in the course".</dd>

<p><br>Proof by picture:
<dd>
A more convincing form of proof by example. Combines well with proof by
omission.</dd>

<p><br>Proof by intimidation:
<dd>
"Trivial."</dd>


<p><br>Proof by adverb:
<dd>
"As is quite clear, the elementary aforementioned statement is obviously valid."</dd>

<p>
<br>Proof by seduction:
<dd>
"Convince yourself that this is true! "</dd>

<p><br>Proof by cumbersome notation:
<dd>
Best done with access to at least four alphabets and special symbols.</dd>

<p><br>Proof by exhaustion:
<dd>
An issue or two of a journal devoted to your proof is useful.</dd>

<p><br>Proof by obfuscation:
<dd>
A long plotless sequence of true and/or meaningless syntactically related
statements.</dd>

<p><br>Proof by wishful citation:
<dd>
The author cites the negation, converse, or generalization of a theorem
from the literature to support his claims.</dd>

<p><br>Proof by eminent authority:
<dd>
"I saw Karp in the elevator and he said it was probably NP- complete."</dd>

<p><br>Proof by personal communication:
<dd>
"Eight-dimensional colored cycle stripping is NP-complete [Karp, personal
communication]."</dd>

<p><br>Proof by reduction to the wrong problem:
<dd>
"To see that infinite-dimensional colored cycle stripping is decidable,
we reduce it to the halting problem."</dd>

<p><br>Proof by reference to inaccessible literature:
<dd>
The author cites a simple corollary of a theorem to be found in a privately
circulated memoir of the Slovenian Philological Society, 1883.</dd>

<p><br>Proof by importance:
<dd>
A large body of useful consequences all follow from the proposition in
question.</dd>

<p><br>Proof by accumulated evidence:
<dd>
Long and diligent search has not revealed a counterexample.</dd>

<p><br>Proof by cosmology:
<dd>
The negation of the proposition is unimaginable or meaningless. Popular
for proofs of the existence of God.</dd>

<p><br>Proof by mutual reference:
<dd>
In reference A, Theorem 5 is said to follow from Theorem 3 in reference
B, which is shown to follow from Corollary 6.2 in reference C, which is
an easy consequence of Theorem 5 in reference A.</dd>

<p><br>Proof by metaproof:
<dd>
A method is given to construct the desired proof. The correctness of the
method is proved by any of these techniques.</dd>

<p><br>Proof by vehement assertion:
<dd>
It is useful to have some kind of authority relation to the audience.</dd>

<p><br>Proof by ghost reference:
<dd>
Nothing even remotely resembling the cited theorem appears in the reference
given.</dd>

<p><br>Proof by semantic shift:
<dd>
Some of the standard but inconvenient definitions are changed for the statement
of the result.</dd>

<p><br>Proof by appeal to intuition:
<dd>
Cloud-shaped drawings frequently help here.</dd>

<p><b>Dictionary of Definitions of Terms Commonly Used in Math. lectures.</b>
<p>The following is a guide to terms which are commonly used but rarely
defined. In the search for proper definitions for these terms we found
no authoritative, nor even recognized, source. Thus, we followed the advice
of mathematicians handed down from time immortal: "Wing It."
<dl>
<dt>
CLEARLY:</dt>

<dd>
I don't want to write down all the "in- between" steps.</dd>

<dt>
TRIVIAL:</dt>

<dd>
If I have to show you how to do this, you're in the wrong class.</dd>

<dt>
OBVIOUSLY:</dt>

<dd>
I hope you weren't sleeping when we discussed this earlier, because I refuse
to repeat it.</dd>

<dt>
RECALL:</dt>

<dd>
I shouldn't have to tell you this, but for those of you who erase your
memory tapes after every test...</dd>

<dt>
WLOG (Without Loss Of Generality):</dt>

<dd>
I'm not about to do all the possible cases, so I'll do one and let you
figure out the rest.</dd>

<dt>
IT CAN EASILY BE SHOWN:</dt>

<dd>
Even you, in your finite wisdom, should be able to prove this without me
holding your hand.</dd>

<dt>
CHECK or CHECK FOR YOURSELF:</dt>

<dd>
This is the boring part of the proof, so you can do it on your own time.</dd>

<dt>
SKETCH OF A PROOF:</dt>

<dd>
I couldn't verify all the details, so I'll break it down into the parts
I couldn't prove.</dd>

<dt>
HINT:</dt>

<dd>
The hardest of several possible ways to do a proof.</dd>

<dt>
BRUTE FORCE (AND IGNORANCE):</dt>

<dd>
Four special cases, three counting arguments, two long inductions, "and
a partridge in a pair tree."</dd>

<dt>
SOFT PROOF:</dt>

<dd>
One third less filling (of the page) than your regular proof, but it requires
two extra years of course work just to understand the terms.</dd>

<dt>
ELEGANT PROOF:</dt>

<dd>
Requires no previous knowledge of the subject matter and is less than ten
lines long.</dd>

<dt>
SIMILARLY:</dt>

<dd>
At least one line of the proof of this case is the same as before.</dd>

<dt>
CANONICAL FORM:</dt>

<dd>
4 out of 5 mathematicians surveyed recommended this as the final form for
their students who choose to finish.</dd>

<dt>
TFAE (The Following Are Equivalent):</dt>

<dd>
If I say this it means that, and if I say that it means the other thing,
and if I say the other thing...</dd>

<dt>
BY A PREVIOUS THEOREM:</dt>

<dd>
I don't remember how it goes (come to think of it I'm not really sure we
did this at all), but if I stated it right (or at all), then the rest of
this follows.</dd>

<dt>
TWO LINE PROOF:</dt>

<dd>
I'll leave out everything but the conclusion, you can't question 'em if
you can't see 'em.</dd>

<dt>
BRIEFLY:</dt>

<dd>
I'm running out of time, so I'll just write and talk faster.</dd>

<dt>
LET'S TALK THROUGH IT:</dt>

<dd>
I don't want to write it on the board lest I make a mistake.</dd>

<dt>
PROCEED FORMALLY:</dt>

<dd>
Manipulate symbols by the rules without any hint of their true meaning
(popular in pure math courses).</dd>

<dt>
QUANTIFY:</dt>

<dd>
I can't find anything wrong with your proof except that it won't work if
x is a moon of Jupiter (Popular in applied math courses).</dd>

<dt>
PROOF OMITTED:</dt>

<dd>
Trust me, It's true.</dd>

<pre>WHAT'S OUT AND WHAT'S IN FOR MATHEMATICAL TERMS

by
Michael Stueben (November 7, 1994)


Today it is considered an egregious faux pas to speak or write in the
crude antedated terms of our grandfathers.&nbsp; To assist the isolated
student and the less sophisticated teacher, I have prepared the
following list of currently fashionable mathematical terms in
academia. I pass this list on to the general public as a matter of
charity and in the hope that it will lead to more refined elucidation
from young scholars.

<p><b>Discovery.</b>
<br>Mathematicians have announced the existence of a new whole number which
lies between 27 and 28. "We don't know why it's there or what it does,"
says Cambridge mathematician, Dr. Hilliard Haliard, "we only know that
it doesn't behave properly when put into equations, and that it is divisible
by six, though only once."&nbsp;

As every engineer knows:

<br>And since <b>Knowledge = Power </b>and <b>Time = Money</b>
<br>It is therefore true that <b>Knowledge = Work / Money </b>.
<br>Solving for <b>Money</b>, we get:

<p><b>Notes on the horse colors problem</b>
<p>Lemma 1. All horses are the same color. (Proof by induction)
<p>Proof. It is obvious that one horse is the same color. Let us assume
the proposition <b>P(k)</b> that <b>k </b>horses are the same color and
use this to imply that <b>k+1</b> horses are the same color. Given the
set of <b>k+1</b> horses, we remove one horse; then the remaining<b> k</b>
horses are the same color, by hypothesis. We remove another horse and replace
the first; the <b>k</b> horses, by hypothesis, are again the same color.
We repeat this until by exhaustion the <b>k+1</b> sets of <b>k </b>horses
have been shown to be the same color. It follows that since every horse
is the same color as every other horse, <b>P(k)</b> entails<b> P(k+1)</b>.
But since we have shown <b>P(1)</b> to be true,<b> P</b> is true for all
succeeding values of <b>k</b>, that is, all horses are the same color.
<p>Theorem 1. Every horse has an infinite number of legs. (Proof by intimidation.)
<p>Proof. Horses have an even number of legs. Behind they have two legs
and in front they have fore legs. This makes six legs, which is certainly
an odd number of legs for a horse. But the only number that is both odd
and even is infinity. Therefore horses have an infinite number of legs.
Now to show that this is general, suppose that somewhere there is a horse
with a finite number of legs. But that is a horse of another color, and
by the lemma that does not exist.
<p>Corollary 1. Everything is the same color.
<p>Proof. The proof of lemma 1 does not depend at all on the nature of
the object under consideration. The predicate of the antecedent of the
universally-quantified conditional 'For all<b> x</b>, if x is a horse,
then<b> x</b> is the same color,' namely 'is a horse' may be generalized
to 'is anything' without affecting the validity of the proof; hence, 'for
all <b>x</b>, if <b>x</b> is anything, <b>x</b> is the same color.'
<p>Corollary 2. Everything is white.
<p>Proof. If a sentential formula in<b> x</b> is logically true, then any
particular substitution instance of it is a true sentence. In particular
then: 'for all <b>x</b>, if <b>x</b> is an elephant, then <b>x</b> is the
same color' is true. Now it is manifestly axiomatic that white elephants
exist (for proof by blatant assertion consult Mark Twain 'The Stolen White
Elephant'). Therefore all elephants are white. By corollary 1 everything
is white.
<p>Theorem 2. Alexander the Great did not exist and he had an infinite
number of limbs.
<p>Proof. We prove this theorem in two parts. First we note the obvious
fact that historians always tell the truth (for historians always take
a stand, and therefore they cannot lie). Hence we have the historically
true sentence, 'If Alexander the Great existed, then he rode a black horse
Bucephalus.' But we know by corollary 2 everything is white; hence Alexander
could not have ridden a black horse. Since the consequent of the conditional
is false, in order for the whole statement to be true the antecedent must
be false. Hence Alexander the Great did not exist.
<br>We have also the historically true statement that Alexander was warned
by an oracle that he would meet death if he crossed a certain river. He
had two legs; and 'forewarned is four-armed.' This gives him six limbs,
an even number, which is certainly an odd number of limbs for a man. Now
the only number which is even and odd is infinity; hence Alexander had
an infinite number of limbs. We have thus proved that Alexander the Great
did not exist and that he had an infinite number of limbs.&nbsp;

<br>A2: None. A mathematician can't screw in a light bulb, but he can easily
prove the work can be done.
<br>A3: One. He gives it to four programmers, thereby reducing the problem
to the already solved (ask a programmer, how)
<br>A4: The answer is intuitively obvious
<br>A5: Just one, once you've managed to present the problem in terms he/she
is familiar with.
<br>A6: In earlier work, Wiener [1] has shown that one mathematician can
change a light bulb.
<br>If <b>k</b> mathematicians can change a light bulb, and if one more
simply watches them do it, then <b>k+1</b> mathematicians will have changed

a nonconstructive algorithm to do it.
<p>How many Bourbakists does it take to replace a lightbulb: ?
<br>Changing a lightbulb is a special case of a more general theorem concerning
the maintain and repair of an electrical system. To establish upper and
lower bounds for the number of personnel required, we must determine whether
the sufficient conditions of Lemma 2.1 (Availability of personnel) and
those of Corollary 2.3.55 (Motivation of personnel) apply. Iff these conditions
are met, we derive the result by an application of the theorems in Section
3.1123. The resulting upper bound is, of course, a result in an abstract
measure space, in the weak-* topology.

The following problem can be solved either the easy way or the hard
way.
<p>Two trains 200 miles apart are moving toward each other; each one is
going at a speed of 50 miles per hour. A fly starting on the front of one
of them flies back and forth between them at a rate of 75 miles per hour.
It does this until the trains collide and crush the fly to death. What
is the total distance the fly has flown?
<p>The fly actually hits each train an infinite number of times before
it gets crushed, and one could solve the problem the hard way with pencil
and paper by summing an infinite series of distances. The easy way is as
follows: Since the trains are 200 miles apart and each train is going 50
miles an hour, it takes 2 hours for the trains to collide. Therefore the
fly was flying for two hours. Since the fly was flying at a rate of 75
miles per hour, the fly must have flown 150 miles. That's all there is
to it.
<p>When this problem was posed to John von Neumann, he immediately replied,
"150 miles."
<br>"It is very strange," said the poser, "but nearly everyone tries to
sum the infinite series."
<br>"What do you mean, strange?" asked Von Neumann. "That's how I did it!"&nbsp;
