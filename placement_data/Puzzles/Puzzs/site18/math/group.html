<dl>&nbsp;
<br>In his famous Lectures on Physics, Richard Feynman described one old
problem, common for many sciences, the central problem that people need
to solve. This is not the problem of elementary particles or unified field;
this is the problem of turbulence. So many scientists try to attack this
problem from various directions.
<p>In our research we consider the junior version of this problem: Wave
Turbulence. An example of such turbulence is the rough sea, which just
represents a superposition of random water waves. Other examples include
long term weather (due to Rossby waves) or optical turbulence (due to electromagnetic
waves).
<p>The Wave Turbulence represents a challenge when there is a double resonance.
This is the case, for example, for acoustic turbulence (or the turbulence
of electromagnetic waves). This is also the case when large scales are
present in the system.
<p>In order to understand the latter situation we study passive advection,
when the velocity field represents a superposition of random waves,
<p>We also consider (with A. Cherkaev) a very different example of turbulence,
which takes place in mass spring chains with nonmonotone stress--strain
relations. We discovered quite unusual waves representing dynamical phase
transitions.
<p>On the laminar level (not yet on the level of turbulence) we consider
(with T. Yoshikawa) the problem of ``water-on-the-ceiling'' (the Rayleigh-Taylor
instability). This instability is crucial in stars, as well as in inertial
nuclear fusion.

<br>My field is inverse problems, especially the recovery of properties
of a medium from measured responses. These problems arise in geophysics
and material sciences, in electromagnetics and engineering, in biomedical
and environmental applications. Mathematically, the problem can often be
formulated as a problem of the identification of the coefficients of the
corresponding differential equation. Its solution leads to a large computational
problem. Inverse problems are usually ill-posed and numerical solutions
are unstable. Various methods of regularization of ill-posed problems are
developed to deal with the instabilities. A group of the methods constrains
the class of possible solutions: One can a priori chose a class of smooth
or blocky functions, and obtain very different solutions! Therefore the
numerical schemes are very sensitive to the type of solution one intends
to construct.
<p>Also, one has to decide what measurements are needed to recover the
properties of the medium. For example, in electrical tomography the voltages
are registered on the surface of the body, these voltages are generated
by the applied currents. The question is: What currents are to be injected
if one wishes to recover the conductivity of the body with a given accuracy?
This question leads to the source optimization problem. A different type
of inverse problem arises when the considered medium is very inhomogeneous,
say it is a fine mixture of two different materials. Then one is interested
in recovering some averaged description of this medium rather than the
exact configuration of the materials.

<dl>Paul Fife is currently engaged in the development and analysis of a
variety of continuum models for phase transitions. These lead to interesting
problems in nonlinear partial differential equations, which he studies
by rigorous or asymptotic methods. The emphasis is on transitions which
occur at material interfaces, such as grain boundaries in metallic alloys,
solidification fronts for pure materials or alloys, and interfaces in polymers.
He is also working with various abstract continuum models for phase changes.
In all of this, one object is to set a framework for the study of physical
properties of such interfaces, an example being the role that excess free
energy and entropy have on the mechanics of motion of the interface. This
is done by discovering mathematical properties which models exhibit and
which may correlate to physical information.

<dl>In many composite materials, the effective behavior depends critically
on the connectedness, or percolation properties of a particular phase.
For example, sandstones are permeable to water only when there is a high
enough volume fraction of pores that they connect and form pathways. Likewise,
the electromagnetic properties of a polymer film with conducting particles
vary dramatically near the critical volume fraction where the particles
begin to form a connected matrix. This critical volume fraction is called
the percolation threshold, and near it the effective transport coefficients,
such as fluid permeability or electrical permittivity and conductivity,
typically display scaling behavior characterized by critical exponents,
similar to a phase transition in statistical mechanics. Much of my recent
mathematical work has focused on analysis of transport in lattice and continuum
percolation models, the connections to statistical mechanics, and the application
of these models to porous media, particulate composites used in smart devices
and conducting films, and electrorheological fluids.
<p>A particularly interesting example is the case of sea ice, a composite
of pure ice with liquid brine and air inclusions. It is permeable to fluid
only when the brine volume fraction exceeds about 5%, which corresponds
to a critical temperature of around -5 degrees C, allowing transport of
brine, nutrients, biomass, and heat through the ice. In the Antarctic,
these processes play an important role in air-sea-ice interactions, in
the life cycles of sea ice algae, and in remote sensing of the pack. We
have been developing percolation models to understand fluid transport in
sea ice, and have also made measurements of percolation structures in Antarctic
sea ice. Motivated by sea ice remote sensing, we have also been developing
(with E. Cherkaev) inverse algorithms for recovering the physical properties
of sea ice or other composites via electromagnetic means. This leads to
other interesting mathematical problems in electromagnetic scattering,
which we have been studying.
<p>In connection with the above areas of research, I have taught graduate
courses in the following areas: Mathematics of Materials, Percolation,
Statistical Mechanics, Applied Linear Operators and Spectral Methods, Applied
Complex Variables and Asymptotic Methods, and Several Complex Variables.

<br>Turbulent combustion is an old subject and remains challenging to most
modern mathematical approaches, including the available computational powers.
One particularly important concept is the turbulent burning velocity, that
is, the effective burning rate enhanced by the turbulence in the flow.
With the lack of good understanding of turbulence itself and the complicated
chemical reaction manifested in many different temporal and spatial scales,
a complete understanding of the turbulent burning velocity seems to be
remote at this stage. However, it is possible to gain important understanding
from some simplified systems by both asymptotic methods and large-scale
computing. The particular simplifications we focus on are use of passive
flows and restricting chemical reaction to some particular regimes. Both
asymptotic methods and numerical methods are integrated at different levels
to achieve the research goals.
