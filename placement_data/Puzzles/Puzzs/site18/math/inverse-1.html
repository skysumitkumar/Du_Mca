<i>This form of publication
is not a joke or a charade-type game: it imitates informal conversations
between colleagues when the "back of the envelope" is used to illustrate
ideas and approaches. In mathematics, this style has proven to be very
efficient and seems to be consistent with mainstream tone of the Web. We
decided to keep this informal style in our Web discussion of the serious
problem of detectability which we formulate below. The standard mathematical
text is placed in the Epilogue.</i>

<h3>
Prologue</h3>

<dl>Consider the problem of detection of a material's damage by simple
electrical measurements. The question addressed is whether or not a conducting
body contains damaged regions inside? Suppose that damaged material forms
inclusions of a lower conductivity, and nothing is known about inclusions
location.</dl>

<dl>A boundary current is applied to detect the presence of inclusions
and the spent energy is measured. The sensitivity (resolution) of measurements
is limited. An inclusion is detected if the difference between the spent
energies for the body with and without inclusions is greater then the noise
level of measurements. We want</dl>

<dl>- to find a current which detects the worst position of inclusions
and</dl>

<dl>- to establish bounds for detectability.</dl>

<dl>The problem of detection naturally arises in technical diagnostics
and tomography where the presence of cracks, corrosion, or other defects
in a sample is to be determined.</dl>

<dl>__________</dl>

<dl>
<h3>
Rules of the game:</h3>

<table>
<caption><i>The problem is formulated as a game between a spot of damaged
material&nbsp;</i>
<br><i>which hides and the boundary current which seeks to find it</i>.
<br>&nbsp;</caption>

<tr>
<td><img SRC="f1-2.gif" tppabs="http://www.math.utah.edu/~cherk/ccli/f1.gif" ></td>

<td>I. Red player places inclusions (damaged material) of fixed total volume
somewhere inside the domain.
<p>II. Green player detects them by injecting arbitrary boundary currents
of fixed energy.&nbsp;
<p>III. The goal of Red is to minimize the energy difference between spot-free
sample and the real one, the goal of Green is to maximize it.&nbsp;
<p>IV. Green has no information about the Red's strategy.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>
The cost of the game is equal to the resolution. The best "Green" strategy
ensures the detection of defects of given size.&nbsp;

An optimal location of a small inclusion and an optimal field density:</h3>
</dl>

<dl>We analyse first the optimal location of an infinitesimal inclusion.</dl>

<table>
<tr>
<td><img SRC="f4-2.gif" tppabs="http://www.math.utah.edu/~cherk/ccli/f4.gif" ></td>

<td>The measured response is proportional to the field density in the neighborhood
of the inclusion. Therefore:
<p>I. The `worst' inclusion hides itself where the field density is minimal.
<p>II. An optimal current maximizes the minimum throughout the domain of
its absolute value, hence the density of an optimal field is constant everywhere.</td>
</tr>

<h3>
Green strategy</h3>
</dl>

<dl>&nbsp;
<table>
<tr>
<td><img SRC="f3-2.gif" tppabs="http://www.math.utah.edu/~cherk/ccli/f3.gif" ></td>

<td>The best strategy for the Green is to make the field inside the tested
body uniform.
<p>The class of Green Currents always contains Neumann data which provide
a constant field inside any homogeneous domain (see the picture).
<p>The constant fields density is independent of the direction of an optimal
current. This direction can be arbitrary chosen.</td>

<h3>
Red strategy:</h3>

<table>
<tr>
<td><img SRC="f2-2.gif" tppabs="http://www.math.utah.edu/~cherk/ccli/f2.gif" ></td>

<td>A shape of the most hidden inclusions.
<p>Hidden inclusions are elongated along the lines of the field: additional
portions of the inclusion material hide in the shadow of seed inclusions.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h3>
Formation of an optimal laminated composite from the hidden inclusions.</h3>

<table>
<tr>
<td><img SRC="f5-1.gif" tppabs="http://www.math.utah.edu/~cherk/ccli/f5.gif" ></td>

<td>In order to hide itself the inclusion disperses and forms laminates
oriented along the field.&nbsp;
<p>One can check that these laminates fit the necessary conditions of optimality:
the current is constant, the inclusions lead to minimal disturbance of
the energy.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<hr>
<h3>
Solution: Inclusions form a laminate composite!</h3>
</dl>

<dl>&nbsp;
<table>
<tr>
<td><img SRC="f6-1.gif" tppabs="http://www.math.utah.edu/~cherk/ccli/f6.gif" ></td>

<td>The most unfortunate distribution of inclusions: homogeneous laminates
oriented along the field. The effective properties of laminates lead to
an analytical lower bound for detectability which is independent of the
shape of the domain.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h3>
Reformulation of the problem:</h3>
</dl>

<dl>Green can do better either by applying a current in another direction
or by applying several currents. The problem is reformulated as following:
<table>
<tr>
<td><img SRC="f7-1.gif" tppabs="http://www.math.utah.edu/~cherk/ccli/f7.gif" ></td>

<td><img SRC="f8-1.gif" tppabs="http://www.math.utah.edu/~cherk/ccli/f8.gif" ></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>either a constant current with random orientation is applied and the
mean of detectability is maximized,</td>

<td>or two orthogonal constant currents are applied.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h3>
Strategy for the reformulated problem</h3>

<table>
<tr>
<td><img SRC="f9-1.gif" tppabs="http://www.math.utah.edu/~cherk/ccli/f9.gif" ></td>

<td>In the reformulated (relaxed) problem, Red uses Laminates of Second
Rank which can be adjusted to minimize the sum of energies due to two orthogonal
currents by changing the free parameter of inclusion density in the inner
layers</td>
</tr>
</table>

<hr>
<h3>
Saddle point</h3>

<table>
<tr>
<td><img SRC="f10-1.gif" tppabs="http://www.math.utah.edu/~cherk/ccli/f10.gif" ></td>

<td>The reformulated problem possesses a saddle point solution.
<p>Optimal solution of the game is achieved by choosing the degree of anisotropy
of the composite and the magnitude of one of the applied currents.&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h3>
Solution of the relaxed problem</h3>

<table>
<tr>
<td><img SRC="f11-1.gif" tppabs="http://www.math.utah.edu/~cherk/ccli/f11.gif" ></td>

<td><b><font color="#008000">Green strategy </font></b>: the magnitudes
of two orthogonal currents are equal
<p><b><font color="#FF0000">Red strategy</font></b>: The worst location
of inclusions is a uniform isotropic composite of the minimal conductivity.
<p>This solution gives an analytical lower bound for detectability in the
reformulated (relaxed) problem.</td>
