The course discusses  structural optimization.  The main problems are to find 
"the best" geometrical composition of the structure and to determine the 
distribution of the optimal structures in the design. 
<P> 
Examples of optimal design include: 
  <UL>
<li> Elastic structures of maximal stiffness.
<li> Conducting structures, able to concentrate  current.
<li>  A game between the load and the structure. 
<LI> Composite with extremal properties. 
  </UL>
Mathematically, we are dealing with variational problems  with non-convex 
Lagrangians. We develop the technique that enables to correctly formulate and 
solve these variational problems with non-stable solutions. We discuss special 
methods based on the quasiconvex envelopes. Applying the technique to the 
mechanical and transport problems, we are able  to find optimal structures for 
the above mentioned problems.
