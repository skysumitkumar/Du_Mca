<h1>
Structural Optimization</h1>
One can obtain stronger, more conducting, or more expanding composites
by a proper arrangement of materials in a
<br>composite cell.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>One can also obtain a composite material with an extremal effective
property when another property is bounded; for
<br>example: A material with the maximal thermal expansion coefficient
and a fixed elastic modulus.

<h4>
The picture illustrates concepts of structural optimization.</h4>

<ul>
<li>
The problem of design asks for a layout of several materials within the
designed body in order to maximize an integral characteristics.</li>

<li>
As a rule, an optimal design is made from optimal composites: fine scale
alternating subdomains of different materials. In order to make optimal
constructions one needs to understand properties of <a href="composites.html" tppabs="http://www.math.utah.edu/~cherk/composites.html">composites</a>
with extremal properties.</li>
</ul>

<h4>
What kind of composites must be used an optimal construction?</h4>
The answer depends on the feature one wants to optimize.

<h4>
Mathematics</h4>
Optimal design problems can be viewed as a special type of <a href="variation.html" tppabs="http://www.math.utah.edu/~cherk/variation.html">variational
problems</a>. Typically, they require minimization of an unstable (not
weakly lower semicontinuous) functional. Therefore special relaxation methods
are developed to find and effectively describe highly oscillating solutions
of these problems. These methods include
<li>
Sufficient conditions methods, particularly the Translation method.</li>

<li>
Searching for minimization sequences, particularly for laminates of a high
rank.</li>

<li>
Necessary conditions and the stable extensions.</li>

<h4>
Stability of optimal designs.</h4>
Optimal structures are generally unstable. Indeed, they concentrate the
resistance capacities in certain directions to stay against a given loading,
therefore they are extremely sensitive to the variation of the loadings.
We are working on designs that compromise effectiveness and stability.

<dl>The next picture shows the crossection of the torsioned bar with maximal
rigidity. The bar is assembled from two materials with different elastic
moduli, the proportion of the materials in the design is fixed.</dl>

<dl>It has been proved (Lurie and Cherkaev, 1980) that an optimal project
is made from either pure given materials or from laminates.
<p>Here, the blue and the red domains denote the originally given strong
and weak materials, the color reflects the volume fractions in optimal
laminates, lines show their directions. The more is the norm of stresses,
the more rigid is the optimal composite.</dl>
