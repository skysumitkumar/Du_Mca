<H1>Optimal Composites</H1>

<UL> 
 <LI>

Optimal composites show with extremal effective properties. 
Our main interest is to find  structures of these composites 
and  to find bounds of the range of their properties. 
The extremal  composites  are used in <A HREF="struct_opt.html" tppabs="http://www.math.utah.edu/~cherk/opt/struct_opt.html">structural 
optimization</A>, 
the bounds provide a priori information of the possible range of achievable properties. 
 </LI>
<P>
 <LI>
The set of effective properties of all possible composites made 
from given materials is called G-closure of the set 
of original properties. The problem is to desribe the  G-closure 
(or its components) for different sets of original materials.

<P>
<LI> The following picture shows the G-closure for two conducting materials and the best structures that correspond to boundaries of the G-closure.  </LI>

Mathematically, the problem of bounds and of extremal structures 
can be formulated as a <A HREF="variation.html" tppabs="http://www.math.utah.edu/~cherk/variation.html">nonconvex variational problem</A> 
of minimization of the sum of energies/complimentary energies 
that a structure stores under different loadings.

We have now a pretty detailed picture of structures of  two-phase  
conducting and elastic materials, but the best structures of multiphase 
composites are mainly unknown. I am working on this extremely interesting 
and knotty problem. 
The difference between two-phase and multi-phase optimal structures is huge. 
It is similar to the difference between the black and white and the color TV.

The following picture shows the variety of the topology of optimal isotropic conducting two-dimensional three materials structure.  Note the optimal topology of two-material mixtures us pretty clear: "good" material outside, "bad" material inside inclusions.

Red color corresponds to  the best conductor, yellow color - to the intermediate conductor, blue color - to the worst conductor.
