<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>What?</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here is a set of
questions that I have with me which software guys
have asked at interviews in the past, most of them are actually from
Microsoft but a few have been pulled together from other places too.
I have collected these from friends and would welcome any additions
from you.
Mail them to kiran AT usc DOT edu. Do send me your solutions, but the
intent of
this page is to kindle enough interest in you to try similar logic and
programming
questions.
<br>
PLEASE DO NOT REQUEST ME FOR MORE SOLUTIONS! </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Why?</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I have grown up
reading Martin Gardner's Scientific American columns
on Mathematical Games and interesting mathematics olympiad problems in
high school. I discovered, to my delight, Bentley's <i>Programming
Pearls</i> and David Gries' <i>The Science of Programming</i> in my
computer science education. There is underlying beauty in mathematics
and computer science. Some find it and others hate the subjects. When I
found some of the Microsoft interview questions
in graduate school, they were similar to mathematical puzzles that I
was interested
in. I started collecting them more as an illustration of interesting
logic puzzles and algorithms in programming, than as an interview aid.
If it has
morphed into an interview questions page, that is more due to interest
from all
interviewees out there.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some of the
programming questions have a basic foundation in mathematics and
algorithms. If the given data structure has a specific amount of
information and
the question asks you to extract/modify the given information, it is
possible
(though not always obvious) to find optimal solutions, and prove that
it cannot be
done any better, by quantifying the information content. But, there are
always elegant and ugly ways to extract the same information. When you
manage to
find out the optimal solution to a problem, it usually not only turns
out to be elegant, but also has the "aha!" factor to it. Try proving
on paper the following question from my undergraduate mid-term:
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. <i>Everyone
Loves All Lovers</i><br>
2. <i>Romeo Loves Juliet</i><br>
Therefore, prove (i.e. 1 AND 2 =&gt; 3)<br>
3. <i>I Love You</i> <br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>How?</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> To answer one of
the more frequent questions that I get: No! I have
never interviewed at Microsoft. In fact, I work in a microprocessor
company far removed from any software development (though I work
mostly in programming). However, I have had two of my roommates and
two more housemates eventually working in Microsoft, in addition to a
large number of friends. None of them have contributed to this page
AFTER they started working at Microsoft. Microsoft itself does not
hold any patents and nor
has it invented most of the questions. Most of them come from
mathematics and physics books, party puzzles, programming lore and
standard textbooks. I know many companies ask similar questions,
though Microsoft might have made the practice more common
(especially with the manhole cover type of questions).
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Usage</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I have spent
some time in collecting with the intention of their value as a
practice session. They are not meant to be exact questions that you
need to know and
answer in an interview. They are supposed to make you think! Discuss
with your friends, colleagues, professors for answers (get your
tuition money's worth). I have left the page in simple text format so
you
can print them out and try them on your flight to the interview in
case you are pressed for time. One of
the strangest phone calls I remember is from a girl, staying up in a
Microsoft
provided hotel room in Redmond the night before the interview, asking
me about the
solution for one of the questions from this page. I hope the rest of
you are saner
(or do not have my phone number).

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 0. Classic: If a
bear walks one mile south, turns left and walks one mile to the east
and then turns left again and walks one mile north and arrives at its
original position, what is the color of the bear.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> ANS. The color
of the bear is trivial. The possible solutions to it are interesting.
In addition to the trivial north pole, there are additional circles
near south pole. Think it out. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">* 1. Given a
rectangular (cuboidal for the puritans) cake with a rectangular piece
removed (any size or orientation), how would you cut the remainder of
the cake into two equal halves with one straight cut of a knife?
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> ANS. Join the
centers of the original and the removed rectangle. It works for cuboids
too! BTW, I have been getting many questions asking why a
horizontal slice across the middle will not do. Please note the "any
size or
orientation" in the question! Don't get boxed in by the way you cut
your birthday cake :) Think out of the box. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 2. There are 3
baskets. one of them have apples, one has oranges only and the other
has mixture of apples and oranges. The labels on their baskets always
lie. (i.e. if the label says oranges, you are sure that it doesn't have
oranges only,it could be a mixture) The task is to pick one basket and
pick only one fruit from it and then correctly label all the three
baskets. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">HINT. There are
only two combinations of distributions in which ALL the
baskets have wrong labels. By picking a fruit from the one labeled
MIXTURE, it is possible to tell what the other two baskets have.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 3. You have 8
balls. One of them is defective and weighs less than others. You have a
balance to measure balls against each other. In 2 weighings how do you
find the defective one?
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 4. Why is a
manhole cover round? </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> HINT. The
diagonal of a square hole is larger than the side of a cover!
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Alternate
answers: 1. Round covers can be transported by one person, because they
can be rolled on their edge. 2. A round cover doesn't need to be
rotated to fit over a hole. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 5. How many cars
are there in the USA? </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 6. You've got
someone working for you for seven days and a gold bar to pay them. The
gold bar is segmented into seven connected pieces. You must give them a
piece of gold at the end of every day. If you are only allowed to make
two breaks in the gold bar, how do you pay your worker? </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 7. One train
leaves Los Angeles at 15mph heading for New York. Another train leaves
from New York at 20mph heading for Los Angeles on the same track. If a
bird, flying at 25mph, leaves from Los Angeles at the same time as the
train and flies back and forth between the two trains until they
collide, how far will the bird have traveled? </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> HINT. Think
relative speed of the trains.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 8. You have two
jars, 50 red marbles and 50 blue marbles. A jar will be picked at
random, and then a marble will be picked from the jar. Placing all of
the marbles in the jars, how can you maximize the chances of a red
marble being picked? What are the exact odds of getting a red marble
using your scheme? </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 9. Imagine you
are standing in front of a mirror, facing it. Raise your left hand.
Raise your right hand. Look at your reflection. When you raise your
left hand your reflection raises what appears to be his right hand. But
when you tilt your head up, your reflection does too, and does not
appear to tilt his/her head down. Why is it that the mirror appears to
reverse left and right, but not up and down? </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 10. You have 5
jars of pills. Each pill weighs 10 gram, except for contaminated pills
contained in one jar, where each pill weighs 9 gm. Given a scale, how
could you tell which jar had the contaminated pills in just one
measurement? </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> ANS. 1. Mark the
jars with numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
<br>
2. Take 1 pill from jar 1, take 2 pills from jar 2, take 3 pills from
jar 3, take 4 pills from jar 4 and take 5 pills from jar 5. <br>
3. Put all of them on the scale at once and take the measurement. <br>
4. Now, subtract the measurement from 150 ( 1*10 + 2*10 + 3*10 + 4*10 +
5*10) <br>
5. The result will give you the jar number which has contaminated pill.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 11. If you had
an infinite supply of water and a 5 quart and 3 quart pail, how would
you measure exactly 4 quarts? </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 12. You have a
bucket of jelly beans. Some are red, some are blue, and some green.
With your eyes closed, pick out 2 of a like color. How many do you have
to grab to be sure you have 2 of the same? </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 13. Which way
should the key turn in a car door to unlock it? </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 14. If you could
remove any of the 50 states, which state would it be and why? </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 15. There are
four dogs/ants/people at four corners of a square of unit distance. At
the same instant all of them start running with unit speed towards the
person on their clockwise direction and will always run towards that
target. How long does it take for them to meet and where?
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> HINT. They will
meet in the center and the distance covered by them is independent of
the path they actually take (a spiral).
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">16. (from Tara
Hovel) A helicopter drops two trains, each on a
parachute, onto a straight infinite railway line. There is an
undefined distance between the two trains. Each faces the same
direction, and upon landing, the parachute attached to each train
falls to the ground next to the train and detaches. Each train has a
microchip that controls its motion. The chips are identical. There
is no way for the trains to know where they are. You need to write
the code in the chip to make the trains bump into each other. Each
line of code takes a single clock cycle to execute. <br>
You can use the following commands (and only these);
<br>
MF - moves the train forward
<br>
MB - moves the train backward
<br>
IF (P) - conditional that's satisfied if the train is next to a
parachute. There is no "then" to this IF statement.
<br>
GOTO
<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ANS.
<br>
A: MF
<br>
IF (P)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; GOTO B
<br>
GOTO A
<br>
-----
<br>
B: MF
<br>
GOTO B
<br>
Explanation: The first line simply gets them off the parachutes. You
need to get the trains off their parachutes so the back train can find
the front train's parachute, creating a special condition that will
allow it to break out of the code they both have to follow initially.
They both loop through A: until the back train finds the front train's
parachute, at which point it goes to B: and gets stuck in that loop.
The front train still hasn't found a parachute, so it keeps in the A
loop. Because each line of code takes a "clock cycle" to execute, it
takes longer to execute the A loop than the B loop, therefore the back
train (running in the B loop) will catch up to the front train.

<h3><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Personality</font></h3>
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is best to read
some website or a book for questions like these.

array of size N in which every number is between 1 and N, determine if
there are any duplicates in it. You are allowed to destroy the array if
you like. [ I ended up giving about 4 or 5 different solutions for
this, each supposedly better than the others ].
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 4. Write a
routine to draw a circle (x ** 2 + y ** 2 = r ** 2) without making use
of any floating point computations at all. [ This one had me stuck for
quite some time and I first gave a solution that did have floating
point computations ].
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 5. Given only
putchar (no sprintf, itoa, etc.) write a routine putlong that prints
out an unsigned long in decimal. [ I gave the obvious solution of
taking % 10 and / 10, which gives us the decimal value in reverse
order. This requires an array since we need to print it out in the
correct order. The interviewer wasn't too pleased and asked me to give
a solution which didn't need the array ].

way to generate the moves by the computer. I mean this should be the
fastest way possible. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The answer is
that you need to store all possible configurations of the board and the
move that is associated with that. Then it boils down to just accessing
the right element and getting the corresponding move for it. Do some
analysis and do some more optimization in storage since otherwise it
becomes infeasible to get the required storage in a DOS machine.

familiar with the ? operator x ? y : z <br>
you want to implement that in a function: int cond(int x, int y, int
z);
using only ~, !, ^, &amp;, +, |, &lt;&lt;, &gt;&gt;
no if statements, or loops or anything else, just those operators, and
the function should correctly return y or z based on the value of x.
You may use constants, but only 8 bit constants. You can cast all you
want. You're not supposed to use extra variables, but in the end, it
won't really matter, using vars just makes things cleaner. You should
be able to reduce your solution to a single line in the end though that
requires no extra vars.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">85. You have an
abstract computer, so just forget everything you know about computers,
this one only does what I'm about to tell you it does. You can use as
many variables
as you need, there are no negative numbers, all numbers are integers.
You do not know
the size of the integers, they could be infinitely large, so you can't
count on truncating at any point. There are NO comparisons allowed, no
if statements or
anything like that. There are only four operations you can do on a
variable. <br>
1) You can set a variable to 0. <br>
2) You can set a variable = another variable.
<br>
3) You can increment a variable (only by 1), and it's a post increment.
<br>
4) You can loop. So, if you were to say loop(v1) and v1 = 10,
your loop would execute 10 times, but the value in v1 wouldn't change
so the first line in the loop can change value of v1 without changing
the number of times you loop.
<br>
You need to do 3 things.
<br>
1) Write a function that decrements by 1.
<br>
2) Write a function that subtracts one variable from another.
<br>
3) Write a function that divides one variable by another.
<br>
4) See if you can implement all 3 using at most 4 variables. Meaning,
you're not making
function calls now, you're making macros. And at most you can have 4
variables. The
restriction really only applies to divide, the other 2 are easy to do
with 4 vars or less. Division on the other hand is dependent on the
other 2 functions, so, if subtract requires 3 variables, then divide
only has 1 variable left unchanged after a call to subtract. Basically,
just make your function calls to decrement and subtract so
you pass your vars in by reference, and you can't declare any new
variables in a function, what you pass in is all it gets.

<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">* 1. You, a designer
want to measure disk traffic i.e. get a histogram showing the relative
frequency of I/O/second for each disk block. The buffer pool has b
buffers and uses LRU replacement policy. The disk block size and buffer
pool block sizes are the same. You are given a routine int
lru_block_in_position (int i) which returns the block_id of the block
in the i-th position in the list of blocks managed by LRU. Assume
position 0 is the hottest. You can repeatedly call this routine. How
would you get the histogram you desire?
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hints and Answers
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 1. Simply do
histogram [lru_block_in_position (b-1)] ++ at frequent intervals... The
sampling frequency should be close to the disk I/O rate. It can be
adjusted by remembering the last block seen in position b. If same,
decrease frequency; if different, increase, with exponential decay etc.
And of course, take care of overflows in the histogram.
