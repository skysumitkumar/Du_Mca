<h1>Solution to the /geometry/tiling/rectangles.with.squares problem</h1>
<hr>
A rectangle can be tiled with (axa) and (bxb) squares,   iff

<pre>
(i) gcd(a,b)=1 , and any of the following hold:
</pre>

either:  both sides of the rectangle are multiples of a;<br>
    or:  both sides of the rectangle are multiples of b;<br>
    or:  one side is a multiple of (ab), and the other is any length EXCEPT
         one of a finite number of "bad" lengths: those numbers which are
         NOT positive integer combinations of a &amp; b. { By Sylvester's theorem
         there are (a-1)(b-1)/2 of these, the largest being (a-1)(b-1)-1. }

<pre>
(ii) gcd(a,b) = d . 
</pre>
     Then merely apply (i) to the problem with a,b replaced
     by a/d, b/d  and the rectangle lengths also divided by d.
     i.e.  all cells must appear in (dxd) subsquares.

<H3>Proof</h3>
It is clear that (ii) follows from (i), and that simple constructions give
the "if" part of (i). For the "only if" part, we prove that...

<p>
(S) If one side of the rectangle is not divisible by a, and the other is
    not divisible by b, then the tiling is impossible.

<p>
The results in (i) follow immediately from (S).

<p>
To prove (S):  ( <em>Chakraborty-Hoey</em> style ).

<p>
Let the width of the rectangle be a NON-(a-multiple). Then the number of
bxb squares starting (i.e. top edge) at row 1 must be a NON-a-multiple.
Thus the number of bxb starting at row 2 must BE an a-multiple. Similarly
for the number starting at rows 3,4,...,b . Then the number starting at
row (b+1) must be a NON-a-multiple again.

<p>
Similarly the number starting at rows (2b+1), (3b+1), (4b+1),... must all be
non-a-multiples. So if the number of rows is NOT a multiple of b, (call it
bx+r), then row (bx+1) must have a NON-a-multiple of bxb squares starting
there, i.e. at least one, and there is no room left to squeeze it in.     [QED]
<hr>

A <em>Rickard-style</em> proof of (S) is also possible, by
coloring the rectangle in vertical strips as shown here:

<pre>
    ..BBB....BBWWW...WBBB....BBWWW...W(..etc)
    ..BBB....BBWWW...WBBB....BBWWW...W
    ..BBB....BBWWW...WBBB....BBWWW...W
      &lt;-  a  -&gt;&lt; b-a &gt;&lt;-  a  -&gt;&lt; b-a &gt;
</pre>
Every square tile covers an a-multiple of black squares. But if the width
is a NON-b-multiple, and the number of rows is a NON-a-multiple, then there
are a NON-a-multiple of black squares in total.    [QED]

<p>
(<b>Note</b>: the coloring must have 1 column of blacks on the right, and any
spare columns of whites on the left.)

&gt;coloring the rectangle in          ..BBB....BBWWW...WBBB....BBWWW...W

&gt;are a NON-a-multiple of black squares in total.    [QED]

This statement of how to position the colouring isn't good enough, I'm
afraid. Take a=4, b=7 and consider e.g. a 19x10 rectangle. Coloured your
way, you get:

<pre>
    BWWWBBBBWWWBBBBWWWB
    BWWWBBBBWWWBBBBWWWB
    :::::::::::::::::::
    BWWWBBBBWWWBBBBWWWB
    BWWWBBBBWWWBBBBWWWB
</pre>
The result has 10*10=100 black squares in it, which *is* a multiple of a=4,
despite the fact that 19 is not a multiple of 7 and 10 is not a multiple of
4.

<p>
Of course, there is an alternative offset for the pattern that does give you
the result you want:

<pre>
    WWBBBBWWWBBBBWWWBBB
    WWBBBBWWWBBBBWWWBBB
    :::::::::::::::::::
    WWBBBBWWWBBBBWWWBBB
    WWBBBBWWWBBBBWWWBBB
</pre>
To show this happens in general: because the width of the rectangle is a
non-multiple of b, it is possible to position it on the pattern so that the
leftmost column in the rectangle is white and the column just right of the
right edge of the rectangle is black. Suppose N columns are black with this
positioning. Then the rectangle contains N*H black cells, where H is the
height of the rectangle.

<p>
If we then shift the rectangle right by one, the number of black columns
increases by 1 and it contains (N+1)*H black cells. The difference between
these two numbers of black cells is H, which is not a multiple of a.
Therefore N*H and (N+1)*H cannot both be multiples of a, and so one of these
two positionings of the pattern will suit your purposes.
