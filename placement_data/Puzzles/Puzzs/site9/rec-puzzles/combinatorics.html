<h2>alphabet.blocks</h2>
What is the minimum number of dice painted with one letter on all six sides
such that all permutations without repetitions of n letters can be formed
by placing n dice together in a line?

<h2>coinage/combinations</h2>
Assuming you have enough coins of 1, 5, 10, 25 and 50 cents, how many
ways are there to make change for a dollar?

<h2>coinage/dimes</h2>
"Dad wants one-cent, two-cent, three-cent, five-cent, and ten-cent
stamps.  He said to get four each of two sorts and three each of the
others, but I've forgotten which.  He gave me exactly enough to buy
them; just these dimes."  How many stamps of each type does Dad want?
A dime is worth ten cents.

<h2>coinage/impossible</h2>
What is the smallest number of coins that you can't make a dollar with?
I.e., for what N does there not exist a set of N coins adding up to a dollar?
It is possible to make a dollar with 1 current U.S. coin (a Susan B. Anthony),
2 coins (2 fifty cent pieces), 3 coins (2 quarters and a fifty cent piece),
etc.  It is not possible to make exactly a dollar with 101 coins.

<h2>color</h2>
An urn contains n balls of different colors.  Randomly select a pair, repaint
the first to match the second, and replace the pair in the urn.  What is the
expected time until the balls are all the same color?

<a href="color.htm" tppabs="http://rec-puzzles.org/sol.pl/combinatorics/color">Solution</a>
<h2>full</h2>
Consider a string that contains all substrings of length n.  For example,
for binary strings with n=2, a shortest string is 00110 -- it contains 00,
01, 10 and 11 as substrings.  Find the shortest such strings for all n.

<h2>gossip</h2>
n people each know a different piece of gossip.  They can telephone each other
and exchange all the information they know (so that after the call they both
know anything that either of them knew before the call).  What is the smallest
number of calls needed so that everyone knows everything?

<h2>grid.dissection</h2>
How many (possibly overlapping) squares are in an mxn grid?  Assume that all
the squares have their edges parallel to the edges of the grid.

<a href="grid.dissection.htm" tppabs="http://rec-puzzles.org/sol.pl/combinatorics/grid.dissection">Solution</a>
<h2>permutation</h2>
Compute the nth permutation of k numbers (or objects).

<h2>subsets</h2>
Out of the set of integers 1,...,100 you are given ten different
integers.  From this set, A, of ten integers you can always find two
disjoint non-empty subsets, S & T, such that the sum of elements in S
equals the sum of elements in T.  Note: S union T need not be all ten
elements of A.  Prove this.

<h2>transitions</h2>
How many n-bit binary strings (0/1) have exactly k transitions
(an adjacent pair of dissimilar bits, i.e., a 01 or a 10)?
