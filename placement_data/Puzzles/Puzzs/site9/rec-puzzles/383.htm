<h1>Solution to the /arithmetic/digits/equations/383 problem</h1>
<hr>
You can get 383 with ((2+50)/25+1)*100+75.

<p>
Of course, if you expect / as in C, the above expression is just 375.
But then you can get 383 with (25*50-100)/(1+2).  Pity there's no way
to use the 75.

<p>
If we had a language that rounded instead of truncating, we could use
((1+75+100)*50)/(25-2) or (2*75*(25+100))/(50-1).

<p>
I imagine your problem lies in not dividing things that aren't
divisible.
