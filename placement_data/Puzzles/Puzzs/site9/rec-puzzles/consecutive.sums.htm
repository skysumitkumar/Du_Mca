<h1>Solution to the /arithmetic/consecutive.sums problem</h1>
<hr>
Generalize to find X (and I) such that
<pre>
    (X + X+1 + X+2 + ... + X+I) = T
</pre>
for any integer T.

<p>
You are asking for all (X,I) s.t. (2X+I)(I+1) = 2T.  The problem is
(very) slightly easier if we don't restrict X to being positive, so
we'll solve this first.

<p>
Note that 2X+I and I+1 must have different parities, so the answer
to the relaxed question is N = 2*(o_1+1)*(o_2+1)*...*(o_n+1), where
2T = 2^o_0*3^o_1*...*p_n^o_n (the prime factorization); this is easily
seen to be the number of ways we can break 2T up into two positive
factors of differing parity (with order).

<p>
In particular, 20000 = 2^5*5^4, hence there are 2*(4+1) = 10 solutions
for T = 10000.  These are (2X+I,I+1):

<pre>
(32*1,5^4)   (32*5,5^3)   (32*5^2,5^2)   (32*5^3,5)   (32*5^4,1)
(5^4,32*1)   (5^3,32*5)   (5^2,32*5^2)   (5,32*5^3)   (1,32*5^4)
</pre>

And they give rise to the solutions (X,I):

<pre>
(-296,624)   (18,124)   (388,24)   (1998,4)     (10000,0)
(297,31)     (-27,179)  (-387,799) (-1997,3999) (-9999,19999)
</pre>

If you require that X&gt;0 note that this is true iff 2X+I &gt; I+1 and
hence the number of solutions to this problem is N/2 (due to the
symmetry of the above ordered pairs).
