<h1>Solution to the /analysis/particle problem</h1>
<hr>
Assumptions:

<ol>
<li> x(0) = 0; x(T) = X

<li> v(0) = 0; v(T) = V

<li> d(a)/dt &lt;= 0
</ol>

Solution:

<pre>
a(t) = constant = A = V^2/2X which implies T = 2X/V.
</pre>

Proof:

<p>
Consider assumptions as they apply to f(t) = A * t - v(t):

<ol>
<li> integral from 0 to T of f = 0

<li> f(0) = f(T) = 0

<li> d^2(f)/dt^2 &lt;= 0
</ol>
From the mean value theorem, f(t) = 0.  QED.
