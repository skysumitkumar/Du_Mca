<h1>Solution to the /decision/high.or.low problem</h1>
<hr>
Pick any cumulative probability function P(x) such that a &gt; b ==&gt; P(a)
&gt; P(b).  Now if the number shown is y, guess "low" with probability
P(y) and "high" with probability 1-P(y).  This strategy yields a
probability of &gt; 1/2 of winning since the probability of being correct
is 1/2*( (1-P(a)) + P(b) ) = 1/2 + (P(b)-P(a)), which is &gt; 1/2 by
assumption.
