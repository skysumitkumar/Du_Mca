<h1>Solution to the /logic/smullyan/painted.heads problem</h1>
<hr>
The one who fell silent, presumably the quickest of the three, reasoned
that his head must be painted also.  The argument goes as follows.
Let's call the quick one Q, and the other two D and S.  Let's assume
Q's head is untouched.  Then D is laughing because S's head is painted,
and vice versa.  But eventually, D and S will realize that their head
must be painted, because the other is laughing.  So they will quit
laughing as soon as they realize this.  So, Q waits what he thinks is
a reasonable amount of time for them to figure this out, and when they
don't stop laughing, his worst fears are confirmed.  He concludes that
his assumption is invalid and he must be crowned in crimson too.
