<h1>Solution to the /arithmetic/digits/most.significant/googol problem</h1>
<hr>
I'm not sure how to calculate the first googol of digits of log10(e), but
here's the first 150(approximately) of them...

<p>
0.43429448190325182765112891891660508229439700580366656611445378316586464920
8870774729224949338431748318706106744766303733641679287158963906569221064663

<p>
We need to deal with the digits immediately after the decimal point in
googol*log10(e), which are  .187061

<pre>
frac[log(googol!)] = frac[halflog2pi + 50 + googol(100-log10(e))]
 = frac{halflog2pi + frac[googol(100-log10(e))]}
 = frac[.399090 + (1- .187061)]
 = .212029

10 ** .212029 = 1.629405
</pre>
Which means that googol! starts with 1629
