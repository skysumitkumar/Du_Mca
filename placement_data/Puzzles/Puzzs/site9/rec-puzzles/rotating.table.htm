<li>  Turn two adjacent glasses up.
<li>  Turn two diagonal glasses up.
<li>  Pull out two diagonal glasses.  If one is down, turn it up and you're done.
    If not, turn one down and replace.
<li>  Take two adjacent glasses.  Invert them both.

The paper mentions (without discussing) two other generalizations:
more than two orientations of the glasses (Graham and Diaconis)
and more symmetries in the table, e.g. those of a cube (Kim).
