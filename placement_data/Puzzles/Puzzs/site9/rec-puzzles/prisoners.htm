<h1>Solution to the /decision/prisoners problem</h1>
<hr>
Each prisoner had an equal chance of being the one chosen to be
executed.  So we have three cases:

<pre>
Prisoner executed:         A    B    C
Probability of this case: 1/3  1/3  1/3
</pre>

Now, if A is to be executed, the warden will randomly choose either B or C,
and tell A that name.  When B or C is the one to be executed, there is only
one prisoner other than A who will not be executed, and the warden will always
give that name.  So now we have:

<pre>
Prisoner executed:  A    A    B    C
Name given to A:    B    C    C    B
Probability:       1/6  1/6  1/3  1/3
</pre>

We can calculate all this without knowing the warden's answer.
When he tells us B will not be executed, we eliminate the middle two
choices above.  Now, among the two remaining cases, C is twice
as likely as A to be the one executed.  Thus, the probability that
A will be executed is still 1/3, and C's chances are 2/3.
