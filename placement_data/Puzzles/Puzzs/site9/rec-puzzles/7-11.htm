The prices are: $1.20, $1.25, $1.50, and $3.16

<p>
$7.11 is not the only number which works.  Here are the first 160 such
numbers, preceded by a count of distinct solutions for that price.
Note that $7.11 has a single, unique solution.

There are plenty of solutions for five summands.  Here are a few:

<pre>
   $8.28  -- at least two solutions
   $8.47  -- at least two solutions
   $8.82  -- at least two solutions

There may be many approximate solutions, for example: $1.01, $1.15, $2.41,
and $2.54.  These sum to $7.11 but the product is 7.1100061.
