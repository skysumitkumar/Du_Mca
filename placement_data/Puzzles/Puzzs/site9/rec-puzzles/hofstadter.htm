<h1>Solution to the /logic/hofstadter problem</h1>
<hr>
Well, one summer, I decided to tackle the problem. Not having any great
knowledge of number theory, I used a more brute force approach. Note
that for greater comprehensibility, I have broken the resulting formula
up into several stages, but it would not be difficult to put it
back together into one vast formula:

<pre>
{e is prime:}
PRIME(e) := 
   ~Eb:Ec:((b+2)*(c+2) = e)

{if e is a prime, true iff a is a power of e:}
PPOWER(a,e) :=
   Ab:Ac:((b*c = a) -&gt; ((b = 1) or (Ed: (e*d) = b)))

{if e is a prime, and a is a power of e, true iff d is the
 (log_e a)th digit (counting from the right, starting with 0)
 in the base-e expansion of n:}
DIG(a,e,d,n) :=
   (d &lt; e) &amp; Eb:Ec:((c &lt; a) &amp; (n = (b*e*a) + (d*a) + c))

{if e is prime, and a is a power of e, true iff n has exactly
 (log_e a) digits in its base-e expansion (0 is counted as having 0
 digits:}
LENGTH(e,a,n):=
   (n &lt; a) &amp; Ab:((PPOWER(b,e) &amp; (b &lt; a)) -&gt; (b &lt;= n))

POWER_OF_TEN(x):=
   Ee:(PRIME(e) &amp; (e &gt; x) &amp;
       En:Ea:(LENGTH(e,a,n) &amp;
              DIG(1,e,1,n) &amp;
              Ai:Aj:Au:(  (PPOWER(u,e) &amp; ((e*u) &lt; a)
			   &amp; DIG(u,e,i,n) &amp; DIG(e*u,e,j,n))
                          -&gt; j = (10 * i)  ) &amp;
              Eu:(PPOWER(u,e) &amp; (e*u = a) &amp; DIG(u,e,x,n))
       )     )
</pre>
The basic idea is that you are asserting that for some prime e greater
than x, we can find a number n which, when expressed in base-e notation,
will have 1 in its units place, 10 in its e's place, 100 in its (e^2)'s
place, and in general have the "digit" in each place be 10 times
greater than the one to its right, such that the leftmost digit is our x.

<p>
To translate into Hofstadter's notation, of course, we must use horse-shoes
instead of -&gt;'s, big carets instead of &amp;'s, letters a through e (followed
by however many ''s) exclusively, and so forth. (We must also replace &lt;'s
and &lt;= with appropriate expansions, and substitute in for our capitalized
formula abbreviations.) This is left as an exercise to the reader.
