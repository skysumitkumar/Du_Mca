Method:

<p>
Let b = the depth of the snow at noon, a = the rate of increase in the
depth.  Then the depth at time t (where noon is t=0) is at+b, the
snowfall started at t_0=-b/a, and the snowplow's rate of progress is 
ds/dt = k/(at+b).

<p>
If the snowplow starts at s=0 then s(t) = (k/a) log(1+at/b).  Note that
s(2 hours) = 1.5 s(1 hour), or  log(1+2A/b) = 1.5 log(1+A/b), where
A = (1 hour)*a.  Letting x = A/b we have (1+2x)^2 = (1+x)^3.  Solve for
x and t_0 = -(1 hour)/x.

<p>
The exact answer is 11:(90-30 Sqrt[5]).

_American Mathematics Monthly_, April 1937, page 245
E 275.  Proposed by J. A. Benner, Lafayette College, Easton. Pa.

<p>
The solution appears, appropriately, in the December 1937 issue,
pp. 666-667.  Also solved by William Douglas, C. E. Springer,
E. P. Starke, W. J.  Taylor, and the proposer.
