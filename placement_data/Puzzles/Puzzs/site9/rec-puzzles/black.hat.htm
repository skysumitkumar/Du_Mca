<h1>Solution to the /logic/smullyan/black.hat problem</h1>
<hr>
A must see at least one black hat, or she would know that her hat is black
since they are not all white.  B also must see at least one black hat, and
further, that hat had to be on C, otherwise she would know that her
hat was black (since she knows A saw at least one black hat).  So C knows
that her hat is black, without even seeing the others' hats.
