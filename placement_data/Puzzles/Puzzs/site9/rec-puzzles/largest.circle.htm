<h1>Solution to the /geometry/dissections/largest.circle problem</h1>
<hr>
There are two methods:

<h3>Method M1:</h3>
The  diameters of the semicircles have to be on the longer sides,
starting at an endpoint of the rectangle.  The two semicircles touch
each other in the middle M of the rectangle.
<pre>
                    a
       D._______________________.C
        |                       |
        |                       |
      b |           . M         |
        |                       |
        |                       |
        |_______.___.___________|
        A       R   X           B
</pre>
R should be the center of the semicircle, and because of RA = RM,
it holds that:
<pre>
   r^2 = (a/2 - r)^2 + (b/2)^2
</pre>
Solving for r gives:

<pre>
   r = min[b,(a^2+b^2)/(4a)], where a &gt;= b.
</pre>
<h3>Method M2:</h3>
We'll cut on the line y = c x, where c will turn out to be slightly
less than d, the slope of the diagonal.  We describe the semicircle
lying above the line y = c x, having this line as the straight part of
the semi-circle.  The center P of the semicircle will be taken on the
line y = d - x, and will be tangent to the left and top of the
rectangle.  Clearly the lower down P is on this line, the better.  The
naive solution is not optimal because the upper place where the
semicircle meets the diagonal is interior to the rectangle.  So we try
to determine c in such a way that this latter point actually lies
slightly down from the top, on the right side of the rectangle.  This
involves solving the quartic:
4r^4 - (4a+16b)r^3 + (16b^2+a^2+8ab)r^2 - (6b^3+4ab^2+2ba^2)r + b^4+(ab)^2 = 0,
where r &lt; b, the details of which will be left to the reader.

<p>
The other semicircle is the reflection of the first through the origin.

<p>
After a few calculations, we find that the value of r given
by M2 is greater than the one given by M1 only if 1 &lt; a/b &lt; 2.472434.
