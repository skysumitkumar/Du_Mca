<h1>Solution to the /logic/josephine problem</h1>
<hr>
The two questions for scroll #1 were:

<ol>
<li> How many husbands were shot on that fateful night?
<li> Why is Queen Henrietta I revered in Mamajorca?
</ol>
The answers are:

<p>
If there are n unfaithful husbands (UHs), every wife of an UH knows of
n-1 UH's while every wife of a faithful husband knows of n UHs.  [this
because everyone has perfect information about everything except the
fidelity of their own husband].  Now we do a simple induction: Assume
that there is only one UH.  Then all the wives but one know that there
is just one UH, but the wife of the UH thinks that everyone is
faithful.  Upon hearing that "there is at least one UH", the wife
realizes that the only husband it can be is her own, and so shoots
him.  Now, imagine that there are just two UH's.  Each wife of an UH
assumes that the situation is "only one UH in town" and so waits to
hear the other wife (she knows who it is, of course) shoot her husband
on the first night.  When no one is shot, that can only be because her
OWN husband was a second UH.  The wife of the second UH makes the same
deduction when no shot is fired the first night (she was waiting, and
expecting the other to shoot, too).  So they both figure it out after
the first night, and shoot their husbands the second night.  It is
easy to tidy up the induction to show that the n UHs will all be shot
just on the n'th midnight.

<p>
The question for scroll #2 is:

<blockquote>
Why is Queen Henrietta II not?
</blockquote>
The answer is:

<p>
The problem now is that QHII didn't realize that it is *critical* that
all of the wives, of faithful and UH's alike, to
*BEGIN*AT*THE*SAME*MOMENT*.  The uncertainty of having a particular
wife's notice come a day or two late makes the whole logic path fall
apart.  That's why she's foolish.  She is unjust, because some wives,
honed and crack logicians all, remember, will *incorrectly* shoot
faithful husbands.  Let us imagine the situation with just a SINGLE UH
in the whole country.  And, wouldn't you know it, the notice to the
wife of the UH just happens to be held up a day, whereas everyone
else's arrived the first day.  Now, all of the wives that got the
notice the first day know that there is just one UH in the country.
And they know that the wife of that UH will think that everyone is
faithful, and so they'll expect her to figure it out and shoot her
husband the first night.  BUT SHE DIDN"T GET THE NOTICE THE FIRST
NIGHT....  BUT THE OTHER WIVES HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING THAT.  So, the
wife of the UH doesn't know that anything is going on and so (of
course) doesn't do anything the first night.  The next day she gets
the notice, figures it all out, and her husband will be history come
that midnight.  BUT... *every* other wife thought that there should
have been a shooting the first night, and since there wasn't there
must have been an additional UH, and it can only have been _her_
husband.  So on the second night **ALL** of the husbands are shot.
Things are much more complicated if the mix of who gets the notice
when is less simple than the one I mentioned above, but it is always
wrong and/or tragic.

<p>
NOTE: if the wives *know* that the country courier service (or however
these things get delivered) is flaky, then they can avoid the
massacre, but unless the wives exchange notes no one will ever be shot
(since there is always a chance that rather than _your_ husband being
an UH, you could reason that it might be that the wife of one of the
UH's that you know about just hasn't gotten her copy of the scroll
yet).  I guess you could call this case "unjust", too, since the UH's
evade punishment, despite the perfect logic of the wives.
