<h2>29</h2>
<pre>Three people check into a hotel.  They pay $30 to the manager and go
to their room.  The manager finds out that the room rate is $25 and
gives $5 to the bellboy to return.  On the way to the room the bellboy
reasons that $5 would be difficult to share among three people so
he pockets $2 and gives $1 to each person.

Now each person paid $10 and got back $1.  So they paid $9 each,
totalling $27.  The bellboy has $2, totalling $29.

Where is the remaining dollar?

<h2>attribute</h2>
<pre>All the items in the first list share a particular attribute.  The second
list is of some items lacking the attribute.

Set#1
    with:  battery, key, yeast, bookmark
    w/out: stapler, match, Rubik's cube, pill bottle

Set#2
    with:  Rubik's cube, chess set, electrical wiring, compass needle

Set#3:
    with:  koosh, small intestine, Yorkshire Terrier, Christmas Tree
    w/out: toothbrush, oak chair, soccer ball, icicle

Points to realize:
1.
 There may be exceptions to any item on the list, for instance a particular
 clock may share the properties of the 'with' list of problem two, BUT MOST
 ORDINARY clocks do not.  All the properties apply the vast majority of the
 the items mentioned.  Extraordinary exceptions should be ignored.

2.
 Pay the most attention to the 'with' list.  The 'without' list is only
 present to eliminate various 'stupid' answers.

  "No person who has seen me in a green tie is to choose before Low.
  "If Y.Y. was not in Oxford in 1920 the first chooser never lent me an
umbrella.
  "If Y.Y. or 'Critic' has second choice, 'Critic' comes before the one
who first fell in love."

Unfortunately Low, Y.Y., and 'Critic' could not remember any of the
relevant facts; but the family solicitor pointed out that, assuming the
problem to be properly constructed (i.e. assuming it to contain no
statement superfluous to its solution) the relevant data and order
could be inferred.

<h2>centrifuge</h2>
<pre>You are a biochemist, working with a 12-slot centrifuge.  This is a gadget
that has 12 equally spaced slots around a central axis, in which you can
place chemical samples you want centrifuged.  When the machine is turned on,
the samples whirl around the central axis and do their thing.

To ensure that the samples are evenly mixed, they must be distributed in the
12 slots such that the centrifuge is balanced evenly.  For example, if you
wanted to mix 4 samples, you could place them in slots 12, 3, 6 and 9
(assuming the slots are numbered from 1 to 12 like a clock).

<h2>children</h2>
<pre>A man walks into a bar, orders a drink, and starts chatting with the
bartender.  After a while, he learns that the bartender has three
children.  "How old are your children?" he asks.  "Well," replies the
bartender, "the product of their ages is 72."  The man thinks for a
moment and then says, "that's not enough information."  "All right,"
continues the bartender, "if you go outside and look at the building
number posted over the door to the bar, you'll see the sum of the
ages."  The man steps outside, and after a few moments he reenters and
declares, "Still not enough!"  The bartender smiles and says, "My
youngest just loves strawberry ice cream."

How old are the children?

In a variant of the problem, it is the oldest child that likes ice cream.
Then either the product is 36 or the sum of the ages is 13 and the
product of the ages is the number posted over the door.

<h2>josephine</h2>
<pre>The recent expedition to the lost city of Atlantis discovered scrolls
attributted to the great poet, scholar, philosopher Josephine. They
number eight in all, and here is the first.

THE KINGDOM OF MAMAJORCA, WAS RULED BY QUEEN HENRIETTA I. IN MAMAJORCA
WOMEN HAVE TO PASS AN EXTENSIVE LOGIC EXAM BEFORE THEY ARE ALLOWED TO
GET MARRIED. QUEENS DO NOT HAVE TO TAKE THIS EXAM. ALL THE WOMEN IN
MAMAJORCA ARE LOYAL TO THEIR QUEEN AND DO WHATEVER SHE TELLS THEM TO.
THE QUEENS OF MAMAJORCA ARE TRUTHFUL. ALL SHOTS FIRED IN MAMAJORCA CAN
BE HEARD IN EVERY HOUSE. ALL ABOVE FACTS ARE KNOWN TO BE COMMON
KNOWLEDGE.

HENRIETTA WAS WORRIED ABOUT THE INFIDELITY OF THE MARRIED MEN IN
MAMAJORCA.  SHE SUMMONED ALL THE WIVES TO THE TOWN SQUARE, AND MADE
THE FOLLOWING ANNOUNCEMENT. "THERE IS AT LEAST ONE UNFAITHFUL HUSBAND
IN MAMAJORCA. ALL WIVES KNOW WHICH HUSBANDS ARE UNFAITHFUL, BUT HAVE
NO KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE FIDELITY OF THEIR OWN HUSBAND. YOU ARE
FORBIDDEN TO DISCUSS YOUR HUSBAND'S FAITHFULNESS WITH ANY OTHER WOMAN.
IF YOU DISCOVER THAT YOUR HUSBAND IS UNFAITHFUL, YOU MUST SHOOT HIM AT
PRECISELY MIDNIGHT OF THE DAY YOU FIND THAT OUT."

THIRTY-NINE SILENT NIGHTS FOLLOWED THE QUEEN'S ANNOUNCEMENT. ON THE
FORTIETH NIGHT, SHOTS WERE HEARD. QUEEN HENRIETTA I IS REVERED IN
MAMAJORCAN HISTORY.

As with all philosophers Josephine doesn't provide the question, but leaves
it implicit in his document. So figure out the questions - there are two -
and answer them.

Here is Josephine's second scroll.

QUEEN HENRIETTA I WAS SUCCEEDED BY DAUGHTER QUEEN HENRIETTA II. AFTER
A WHILE HENRIETTA LIKE HER FAMOUS MOTHER BECAME WORRIED ABOUT THE
INFIDELITY PROBLEM. SHE DECIDED TO ACT, AND SENT A LETTER TO HER
SUBJECTS (WIVES) THAT CONTAINED THE EXACT WORDS OF HENRIETTA I'S
FAMOUS SPEECH.  SHE ADDED THAT THE LETTERS WERE GUARENTEED TO REACH
ALL WIVES EVENTUALLY.

QUEEN HENRIETTA II IS REMEMBERED AS A FOOLISH AND UNJUST QUEEN.

<h2>riddle</h2>
<pre>Who makes it, has no need of it.  Who buys it, has no use for it.  Who
uses it can neither see nor feel it.


Tell me what a dozen rubber trees with thirty boughs on each might be?


As I went over London Bridge
I met my sister Jenny
I broke her neck and drank her blood
And left her standing empty


It is said among my people that some things are improved by death.
Tell me, what stinks while living, but in death, smells good?


All right.  Riddle me this:  what goes through the door without
pinching itself?  What sits on the stove without burning itself?  What
sits on the table and is not ashamed?


What work is it that the faster you work, the longer it is before
you're done, and the slower you work, the sooner you're finished?


Whilst I was engaged in sitting I spied the dead carrying the living.


I know a word of letters three.  Add two, and fewer there will be.


I give you a group of three.  One is sitting down, and will never get
up.  The second eats as much as is given to him, yet is always hungry.
The third goes away and never returns.


Whoever makes it, tells it not.  Whoever takes it, knows it not.  And
whoever knows it wants it not.


Two words, my answer is only two words.
To keep me, you must give me.


Sir, I bear a rhyme excelling
In mystic force and magic spelling
Celestial sprites elucidate
All my own striving can't relate


There is not wind enough to twirl
That one red leaf, nearest of its clan,
Which dances as often as dance it can.


Half-way up the hill, I see thee at last
Lying beneath me with thy sounds and sights --
A city in the twilight, dim and vast,
With smoking roofs, soft bells, and gleaming lights.


I am, in truth, a yellow fork
From tables in the sky
By inadvertent fingers dropped
The awful cutlery.
Of mansions never quite disclosed
And never quite concealed
The apparatus of the dark
To ignorance revealed.


Many-maned scud-thumper,
Maker of worn wood,
Shrub-ruster,
Sky-mocker,
Rave!


Make me thy lyre, even as the forests are.
What if my leaves fell like its own --
The tumult of thy mighty harmonies
Will take from both a deep autumnal tone.


This darksome burn, horseback brown,
His rollock highroad roaring down,
In coop and in comb the fleece of his foam
Flutes and low to the body falls home.


I've measured it from side to side,
'Tis three feet long and two feet wide.
It is of compass small, and bare
To thirsty suns and parching air.


My love, when I gaze on thy beautiful face,
Careering along, yet always in place --
The thought has often come into my mind
If I ever shall see thy glorious behind.


Then all thy feculent majesty recalls
The nauseous mustiness of forsaken bowers,
The leprous nudity of deserted halls --
The positive nastiness of sullied flowers.
And I mark the colours, yellow and black,
That fresco thy lithe, dictatorial thighs.


When young, I am sweet in the sun.
When middle-aged, I make you gay.
When old, I am valued more than ever.


I am always hungry,
I must always be fed,
The finger I lick
Will soon turn red.


All about, but cannot be seen,
Can be captured, cannot be held,
No throat, but can be heard.


I am only useful
When I am full,
Yet I am always
Full of holes.


If you break me
I do not stop working,
If you touch me
I may be snared,
If you lose me
Nothing will matter.


If a man carried my burden
He would break his back.
I am not rich,
But leave silver in my track.


Until I am measured
I am not known,
Yet how you miss me
When I have flown.


I drive men mad
For love of me,
Easily beaten,
Never free.


When set loose
I fly away,
Never so cursed
As when I go astray.


I go around in circles
But always straight ahead,
Never complain
No matter where I am led.


Lighter than what
I am made of,
More of me is hidden
Than is seen.


I turn around once,
What is out will not get in.
I turn around again,
What is in will not get out.


Each morning I appear
To lie at your feet,
All day I will follow
No matter how fast you run,
Yet I nearly perish
In the midday sun.


Weight in my belly,
Trees on my back,
Nails in my ribs,
Feet I do lack.


Bright as diamonds,
Loud as thunder,
Never still,
A thing of wonder.


My life can be measured in hours,
I serve by being devoured.
Thin, I am quick
Fat, I am slow
Wind is my foe.


To unravel me
You need a simple key,
No key that was made
By locksmith's hand,
But a key that only I
Will understand.


I am seen in the water
If seen in the sky,
I am in the rainbow,
A jay's feather,
And lapis lazuli.


Glittering points
That downward thrust,
Sparkling spears
That never rust.


You heard me before,
Yet you hear me again,
Then I die,
'Till you call me again.


Three lives have I.
Gentle enough to soothe the skin,
Light enough to caress the sky,
Hard enough to crack rocks.


You can see nothing else
When you look in my face,
I will look you in the eye
And I will never lie.


Lovely and round,
I shine with pale light,
grown in the darkness,
A lady's delight.


At the sound of me, men may dream
Or stamp their feet
At the sound of me, women may laugh
Or sometimes weep


When I am filled
I can point the way,
When I am empty
Nothing moves me,
I have two skins
One without and one within.


My tines be long,
My tines be short
My tines end ere
My first report.
What am I?


With thieves I consort,
With the vilest, in short,
  I'm quite at ease in depravity;
Yet all divines use me,
And savants can't lose me,
  For I am the center of gravity.


As a whole, I am both safe and secure.
Behead me, and I become a place of meeting.
Behead me again, and I am the partner of ready.
Restore me, and I become the domain of beasts.
What am I?


I sought my first in starry skies
  Where shines the April sun;
My second came before my eyes,
  And warned me to be done.

'Tis very hard to lose one's sight;
  I'm blind as bat or mole;
Once hills and fields were my delight,
  Now I'm no more my whole.


My first is high,
  My second damp,
My whole a tie,
  A writer's cramp.


A hundred and one
  by fifty divide,
And if a cipher
  is rightly applied,
The answer is one from nine.


What does man love more than life
Fear more than death or mortal strife
What the poor have, the rich require,
and what contented men desire,
What the miser spends and the spendthrift saves 
And all men carry to their graves?


I build up castles.
I tear down mountains.
I make some men blind,
I help others to see.
	What am I?


Ripped from my mother's womb,
Beaten and burned,
I become a blood-thirsty slayer
	What am I?


Five hundred begins it, five hundred ends it,
Five in the middle is seen;
First of all figures, the first of all letters,
Take up their stations between.
Join all together, and then you will bring
Before you the name of an eminent king.


'Tween marble walls, white as milk,
Lined with a skin as soft as silk,
Within a fountain, crystal clear,
A golden apple doth appear.
No doors or locks has this stronghold,
Yet thieves break in, and steal the gold.

For ages an edifice here has been found
  It is not a dwelling it is not a fane;
A horseman for hundreds of days may ride round,
  Yet the end of the journey he ne'er can attain.
Full many a century o'er it has pass'd,
  The might of the storm and of time it defies;
'Neath the rainbow of Heaven stands free to the last, --
  In the ocean it dips, and soars up to the skies.
It was not a vain glory bade its erection
  It serves as a refuge, a shield or protection;
Its like on the earth never yet has been known
  And yet by man's hand it is fashion'd alone.

We are airy little creatures,
All of different voice and features;
One of us in "glass" is set,
One of us you'll find in "jet,"
T'other you may see in "tin,"
And the fourth a "box" within.
If the fifth you should pursue,
It can never fly from "you."

A headless man had a letter to write;
He who read it had lost his sight;
The dumb repeated it word for word;
And deaf was he who listened and heard.

<h2>same.street</h2>
<pre>Sally and Sue have a strong desire to date Sam.  They all live on the
same street yet neither Sally or Sue know where Sam lives.  The houses
on this street are numbered 1 to 99.

Sally asks Sam "Is your house number a perfect square?".  He answers.
Then Sally asks "Is is greater than 50?".  He answers again.

Sally thinks she now knows the address of Sam's house and decides to
visit.

When she gets there, she finds out she is wrong.  This is not
surprising, considering Sam answered only the second question
truthfully.

Sue, unaware of Sally's conversation, asks Sam two questions.
Sue asks "Is your house number a perfect cube?".  He answers.
She then asks "Is it greater than 25?".  He answers again.

Sue thinks she knows where Sam lives and decides to pay him a visit.
She too is mistaken as Sam once again answered only the second 
question truthfully.

If I tell you that Sam's number is less than Sue's or Sally's,
and that the sum of their numbers is a perfect square multiplied
by two, you should be able to figure out where all three of them
live.

<h2>situation.puzzles</h2>

What happened?"

These are called situation puzzles.  In the game of situation puzzles,
a situation like the one above is presented to a group of players, who
must then try to find out more about the situation by asking further
questions.  The person who initially presented the situation can only
answer "yes" or "no" to questions (or occasionally "irrelevant" or
"doesn't matter").

What are some of these puzzles?

<h2>supertasks</h2>
<pre>You have an empty urn, and an infinite number of labeled balls.  Each
has a number written on it corresponding to when it will go in.  At a
minute to the hour, you take the first ten balls and put them in the
urn, and remove the last ball.  At the next half interval, you put in
the next ten balls, and remove ball number 20.  At the next half
interval, you put in ten more balls and remove ball 30.  This continues
for the whole minute.... how many balls are in the urn at this point?
(infinite)

You have the same urn, and the same set of balls.  This time, you put
in 10 balls and remove ball number 1.  Then you put in another ten
balls and remove ball number 2.  Then you put in another ten balls and
remove ball number 3.  After the minute is over, how many balls are
left in the urn now? (zero)

Are the above answers correct, and why or why not?

However, we can prove by induction that the drill cannot be held.  Clearly,

day.  But if it cannot be held on Friday, then by induction it cannot be held

<h2>verger</h2>
<pre>A very bright and sunny Day
The Priest did to the Verger say:
"Last Monday met I strangers three
None of which were known to Thee.
I ask'd Them of Their Age combin'd
which amounted twice to Thine!
A Riddle now will I give Thee:
Tell Me what Their Ages be!"

So the Verger ask'd the Priest:
"Give to Me a Clue at least!"
"Keep Thy Mind and Ears awake,
And see what Thou of this can make.
Their Ages multiplied make plenty,
Fifty and Ten Dozens Twenty."

The Verger had a sleepless Night
To try to get Their Ages right.
"I almost found the Answer right.
Please shed on it a little Light."
"A little Clue I give to Thee,
I'm older than all Strangers three."
After but a little While
The Verger answered with a Smile:
"Inside my Head has rung a Bell.
Now I know the answer well!"


Now, the question is:

How old is the PRIEST??

<h2>zoo</h2>
<pre> I took some nephews and nieces to the Zoo, and we halted at a cage marked

		    Tovus Slithius, male and female.
		  Beregovus Mimsius, male and female.
		     Rathus Momus, male and female.
		Jabberwockius Vulgaris, male and female.

 The eight animals were asleep in a row, and the children began to guess
 which was which.  "That one at the end is Mr Tove."  "No, no!  It's Mrs
 Jabberwock," and so on.  I suggested that they should each write down
 the names in order from left to right, and offered a prize to the one
 who got most names right.

 As the four species were easily distinguished, no mistake would arise in
 pairing the animals; naturally a child who identified one animal as Mr
 Tove identified the other animal of the same species as Mrs Tove.

 The keeper, who consented to judge the lists, scrutinised them carefully.
 "Here's a queer thing.  I take two of the lists, say, John's and Mary's.
 The animal which John supposes to be the animal which Mary supposes to be
 Mr Tove is the animal which Mary supposes to be the animal which John
 supposes to be Mrs Tove.  It is just the same for every pair of lists,
 and for all four species.

 "Curiouser and curiouser!  Each boy supposes Mr Tove to be the animal
 which he supposes to be Mr Tove; but each girl supposes Mr Tove to be
 the animal which she supposes to be Mrs Tove.  And similarly for the oth-
 er animals.  I mean, for instance, that the animal Mary calls Mr Tove
 is really Mrs Rathe, but the animal she calls Mrs Rathe is really Mrs
 Tove."

 "It seems a little involved," I said, "but I suppose it is a remarkable
 coincidence."

 "Very remarkable," replied Mr Dodgson (whom I had supposed to be the
 keeper) "and it could not have happened if you had brought any more
 children."

 How many nephews and nieces were there?  Was the winner a boy or a girl?
 And how many names did the winner get right?	[by Sir Arthur Eddington]
