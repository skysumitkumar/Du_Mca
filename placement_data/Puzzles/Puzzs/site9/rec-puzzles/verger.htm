<h1>Solution to the /logic/verger problem</h1>
<hr>
The puzzler tried to take the test;<br>
Intriguing rhymes he wished to best.<br>
But "Fifty and ten dozens twenty"<br>
made his headache pound aplenty.<br>
When he finally found some leisure,<br>
He took to task this witty treasure.<br>

<p>
"The product of the age must be<br>
Twenty-Four Hundred Fifty!"<br>
Knowing that, he took its primes,<br>
permuted them as many times<br>
as needed, til he found amounts<br>
equal to, by all accounts,<br>
twice the Verger's age, so that<br>
He would have that next day's spat.<br>

<p>
The reason for the lad's confusion<br>
was due to multiple solution!<br>
Hence he needed one more clue<br>
to give the answer back to you!<br>
Since only one could fit the bill,<br>
and then confirm the priest's age still,<br>
the eldest age of each solution<br>
by one could differ, with no coercion.  &lt;=(Sorry)<br>

<p>
Else, that last clue's revelation<br>
would not have brought information!<br>
With two, two, five, seven, and seven,<br>
construct three ages, another set of seven.<br>
Two sets of three yield sixty-four,<br>
Examine them, yet one time more.<br>
The eldest age of each would be<br>
forty-nine, and then, fifty!<br>

<p>
With lack of proper rhyme and meter,<br>
I've tried to be the first completor<br>
of this poem and a puzzle;<br>
my poetry, you'd try to muzzle!<br>
And lest you think my wit is thrifty,<br>
The answer, of course, must be fifty!<br>
If dispute, you wish to tender,<br>
note my addresss, as the sender!<br>
