<h2>handshake</h2>
<pre>At a party people shake hands with all the people they do not know.  A
married couple organizes the party; they only invite other married
couples.  It is assumed everybody knows him/herself and his/her
partner.

When all couples have arrived and all the handshaking has been done,
the host mingles among the guests and asks everybody (including his
wife): "How many hands did you shake?". To his surprise, all responses
are different.

With the above information, you should be able to determine how many
hands the host and hostess each shook.

<h2>hanoi</h2>

of towers?  Is there an equation for determining the minimum number of
moves required to solve it, given a variable number of disks and towers?

<h2>party</h2>
<pre>You're at a party.  Any two (different) people at the party have exactly one
friend in common (the friend is also at the party).  Prove that there is at
least one person at the party who is a friend of everyone else.  Assume that
the friendship relation is symmetric and not reflexive.

<h2>takeover</h2>
<pre>After graduating from college, you have taken an important managing position
in the prestigious financial firm of "Mary and Lee".
You are responsible for all the decisions concerning take-over bids.
Your immediate concern is whether to take over "Financial Data".
There is no doubt that you will be successful if you are the first to
bid and that this will be profitable for the firm and you in the long
run.  However, you know that there exist another n financial firms,
similar to "Mary and Lee", that are also considering the possibility.
Although you are likely to be the first one to move, you know that
just after a take-over there is a lot of adjustment that needs to be
done.  In fact, for a period of time following any take-over the
successful firm becomes a prime candidate for a take-over which will
cost the job of whoever is responsible for take-overs.  Among all
financial firms it is common knowledge that the managers responsible
for take-overs are rational and intelligent.  What is your best response?
