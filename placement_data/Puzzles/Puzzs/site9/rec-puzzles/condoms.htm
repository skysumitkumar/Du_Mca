<h1>Solution to the /logic/condoms problem</h1>
<hr>
Use both condoms on the first woman.  Take off the outer condom (turning it
inside-out in the process) and set it aside.  Use the inner condom alone on
the second woman.  Put the outer condom back on.  Use it on the third woman.

<p>
First man uses both condoms.  Take off the outer condom (do NOT reverse
it) and have second man use it.  First man takes off the inner condom
(turning it inside-out).  Third man puts on this condom, followed by
second man's condom.
