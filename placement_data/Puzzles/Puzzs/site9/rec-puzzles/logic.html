Three people check into a hotel.  They pay $30 to the manager and go
to their room.  The manager finds out that the room rate is $25 and
gives $5 to the bellboy to return.  On the way to the room the bellboy
reasons that $5 would be difficult to share among three people so
he pockets $2 and gives $1 to each person.

Now each person paid $10 and got back $1.  So they paid $9 each,
totalling $27.  The bellboy has $2, totalling $29.

Where is the remaining dollar?

<h2>ages</h2>
<ul>
<li>
   Ten years from now Tim will be twice as old as Jane was when Mary was 
   nine times as old as Tim.

<li>
   Eight years ago, Mary was half as old as Jane will be when Jane is one year
   older than Tim will be at the time when Mary will be five times as old as 
   Tim will be two years from now.

<li>
   When Tim was one year old, Mary was three years older than Tim will be when 
   Jane is three times as old as Mary was six years before the time when Jane 
   was half as old as Tim will be when Mary will be ten years older than Mary 
   was when Jane was one-third as old as Tim will be when Mary will be three 
   times as old as she was when Jane was born.

<h2>attribute</h2>
All the items in the first list share a particular attribute.  The second
list is of some items lacking the attribute.

<ul>
<li>
    <b>with:</b>  battery, key, yeast, bookmark
    <b>w/out:</b> stapler, match, Rubik's cube, pill bottle

<li>
    <b>with:</b>  Rubik's cube, chess set, electrical wiring, compass needle
    <b>w/out:</b> clock, rope, tic-tac-toe, pencil sharpener

<li>
    <b>with:</b>  koosh, small intestine, Yorkshire Terrier, Christmas Tree
    <b>w/out:</b> toothbrush, oak chair, soccer ball, icicle
</ul>

Points to realize:
1.
 There may be exceptions to any item on the list, for instance a particular
 clock may share the properties of the 'with' list of problem two, BUT MOST
 ORDINARY clocks do not.  All the properties apply the vast majority of the
 the items mentioned.  Extraordinary exceptions should be ignored.

2.
 Pay the most attention to the 'with' list.  The 'without' list is only
 present to eliminate various 'stupid' answers.

<h2>camel</h2>
An Arab sheikh tells his two sons to race their camels to a distant
city to see who will inherit his fortune.  The one whose camel is
slower will win.  The brothers, after wandering aimlessly for days, ask
a wise man for advise.  After hearing the advice they jump on the
camels and race as fast as they can to the city.  What does the wise
man say?

<h2>centrifuge</h2>
You are a biochemist, working with a 12-slot centrifuge.  This is a gadget
that has 12 equally spaced slots around a central axis, in which you can
place chemical samples you want centrifuged.  When the machine is turned on,
the samples whirl around the central axis and do their thing.

To ensure that the samples are evenly mixed, they must be distributed in the
12 slots such that the centrifuge is balanced evenly.  For example, if you
wanted to mix 4 samples, you could place them in slots 12, 3, 6 and 9
(assuming the slots are numbered from 1 to 12 like a clock).

Problem:  Can you use the centrifuge to mix 5 samples?

<h2>children</h2>
A man walks into a bar, orders a drink, and starts chatting with the
bartender.  After a while, he learns that the bartender has three
children.  "How old are your children?" he asks.  "Well," replies the
bartender, "the product of their ages is 72."  The man thinks for a
moment and then says, "that's not enough information."  "All right,"
continues the bartender, "if you go outside and look at the building
number posted over the door to the bar, you'll see the sum of the
ages."  The man steps outside, and after a few moments he reenters and
declares, "Still not enough!"  The bartender smiles and says, "My
youngest just loves strawberry ice cream."

How old are the children?

A variant of the problem is for the sum of the ages to be 13 and the
product of the ages to be the number posted over the door.  In this
case, it is the oldest that loves ice cream.

Then how old are they?

<h2>elimination</h2>
97 baseball teams participate in an annual state tournament.
The way the champion is chosen for this tournament is by the same old
elimination schedule. That is, the 97 teams are to be divided into
pairs, and the two teams of each pair play against each other.
After a team is eliminated from each pair, the winners would
be again divided into pairs, etc.  How many games must be played

<h2>josephine</h2>
The recent expedition to the lost city of Atlantis discovered scrolls
attributted to the great poet, scholar, philosopher Josephine. They
number eight in all, and here is the first.

<blockquote>
The kingdom of Mamajorca, was ruled by queen Henrietta I. In Mamajorca
women have to pass an extensive logic exam before they are allowed to
get married. Queens do not have to take this exam. All the women in
Mamajorca are loyal to their queen and do whatever she tells them to.
The queens of Mamajorca are truthful. All shots fired in Mamajorca can
be heard in every house. All above facts are known to be common
knowledge.

Henrietta was worried about the infidelity of the married men in
Mamajorca.  She summoned all the wives to the town square, and made
the following announcement. "There is at least one unfaithful husband
in Mamajorca. All wives know which husbands are unfaithful, but have
no knowledge about the fidelity of their own husband. You are
forbidden to discuss your husband's faithfulness with any other woman.
If you discover that your husband is unfaithful, you must shoot him at
precisely midnight of the day you find that out."

Thirty-nine silent nights followed the queen's announcement. On the
fortieth night, shots were heard. Queen Henrietta I is revered in
Mamajorcan history.
</blockquote>
As with all philosophers Josephine doesn't provide the question, but leaves
it implicit in his document. So figure out the questions - there are two -
and answer them.

Here is Josephine's second scroll.

<blockquote>
Queen Henrietta I was succeeded by daughter queen Henrietta II. After
a while Henrietta like her famous mother became worried about the
infidelity problem. She decided to act, and sent a letter to her
subjects (wives) that contained the exact words of Henrietta I's
famous speech.  She added that the letters were guarenteed to reach
all wives eventually.

Queen Henrietta II is remembered as a foolish and unjust queen.

<h2>monty.52</h2>
Monty and Waldo play a game with N closed boxes.  Monty hides a
dollar in one box; the others are empty.  Monty opens the empty boxes
one by one.  When there are only two boxes left Waldo opens either box;
he wins if it contains the dollar.  Prior to each of the N-2 box
openings Waldo chooses one box and locks it, preventing Monty from opening
it next.  That box is then unlocked and cannot be so locked twice in a row.

What are the optimal strategies for Monty and Waldo and what is the
fair price for Waldo to pay to play the game?

<h2>number</h2>
Mr. S. and Mr. P. are both perfect logicians, being able to correctly deduce
any truth from any set of axioms.  Two integers (not necessarily unique) are
somehow chosen such that each is within some specified range.  Mr. S.
is given the sum of these two integers; Mr. P. is given the product of these
two integers.  After receiving these numbers, the two logicians do not
have any communication at all except the following dialogue:
<ul>
<li>   Mr. P.:  I do not know the two numbers.
<li>   Mr. S.:  I knew that you didn't know the two numbers.
<li>   Mr. P.:  Now I know the two numbers.
<li>   Mr. S.:  Now I know the two numbers.
</ul>

<h2>same.street</h2>
Sally and Sue have a strong desire to date Sam.  They all live on the
same street yet neither Sally or Sue know where Sam lives.  The houses
on this street are numbered 1 to 99.

Sally asks Sam "Is your house number a perfect square?".  He answers.
Then Sally asks "Is is greater than 50?".  He answers again.

Sally thinks she now knows the address of Sam's house and decides to
visit.

When she gets there, she finds out she is wrong.  This is not
surprising, considering Sam answered only the second question
truthfully.

Sue, unaware of Sally's conversation, asks Sam two questions.
Sue asks "Is your house number a perfect cube?".  He answers.
She then asks "Is it greater than 25?".  He answers again.

Sue thinks she knows where Sam lives and decides to pay him a visit.
She too is mistaken as Sam once again answered only the second 
question truthfully.

If I tell you that Sam's number is less than Sue's or Sally's,
and that the sum of their numbers is a perfect square multiplied
by two, you should be able to figure out where all three of them
live.

<h2>smullyan/priest</h2>
In a small town there are N married couples in which one of the pair
has committed adultery.  Each adulterer has succeeded in keeping their
dalliance a secret from their spouse.  Since it is a small town,
everyone knows about everyone else's infidelity.  In other words, each
spouse of an adulterer thinks there are N - 1 adulterers, but everyone
else thinks there are N adulterers.

People of this town have a tradition of denouncing their spouse in
church if they are guilty of adultery.  So far, of course, no one has
been denounced.  In addition, people of this town are all amateur
logicians of sorts, and can be expected to figure out the implications
of anything they know.

A priest has heard the confession of all the people in the town, and is
troubled by the state of moral turpitude.  He cannot break the
confessional, but knowing of his flock's logical turn of mind, he hits
upon a plan to do God's work.  He announces in Mass one Sunday that
there is adultery in the town.

Is the priest correct?  Will this result in every adulterer being denounced?

if they know the colors of their own stamps:

<h2>weighing/weighings</h2>
Some of the supervisors of Scandalvania's n mints are producing bogus coins.
It would be easy to determine which mints are producing bogus coins but,
alas, the only scale in the known world is located in Nastyville,
which isn't on very friendly terms with Scandalville.  In fact, Nastyville's
king will only let you use the scale twice.  Your job?  You must determine
which of the n mints are producing the bogus coins using only two weighings
and the minimum number of coins (your king is rather parsimonious, to put it
nicely).  This is a true scale, i.e. it will tell you the weight of whatever
you put on it.  Good coins are known to have a weight of 1 ounce and it is
also known that all the bogus mints (if any) produce coins that are
light or heavy by the same amount.

coins suffice, one from each mint.

<h2>zoo</h2>
 I took some nephews and nieces to the Zoo, and we halted at a cage marked
<p>
<ul>
<li>		    Tovus Slithius, male and female.
<li>		  Beregovus Mimsius, male and female.
<li>		     Rathus Momus, male and female.
<li>		Jabberwockius Vulgaris, male and female.
</ul>
 The eight animals were asleep in a row, and the children began to guess
 which was which.  "That one at the end is Mr Tove."  "No, no!  It's Mrs
 Jabberwock," and so on.  I suggested that they should each write down
 the names in order from left to right, and offered a prize to the one
 who got most names right.

<p>
 As the four species were easily distinguished, no mistake would arise in
 pairing the animals; naturally a child who identified one animal as Mr
 Tove identified the other animal of the same species as Mrs Tove.

 <p>
 The keeper, who consented to judge the lists, scrutinised them carefully.
 "Here's a queer thing.  I take two of the lists, say, John's and Mary's.
 The animal which John supposes to be the animal which Mary supposes to be
 Mr Tove is the animal which Mary supposes to be the animal which John
 supposes to be Mrs Tove.  It is just the same for every pair of lists,
