<h2>smuggler</h2>
Somewhere on the high sees smuggler S is attempting, without much
luck, to outspeed coast guard G, whose boat can go faster than S's. G
is one mile east of S when a heavy fog descends. It's so heavy that
nobody can see or hear anything further than a few feet. Immediately
after the fog descends, S changes course and attempts to escape at
constant speed under a new, fixed course. Meanwhile, G has lost track
of S. But G happens to know S's speed, that it is constant, and that S
is sticking to some fixed heading, unknown to G.

How does G catch S? 

G may change course and speed at will. He knows his own speed and
course at all times. There is no wind, G does not have radio or radar,
there is enough space for maneuvering, etc.

seventh below the middle cube, to effectively form a 3-dimensional
Swiss cross.

Can a number of such blocks (of 7 cubes each) be arranged so that they
are able to completely fill up a big cube (say 10 times the size of
the small cubes)? It is all right if these blocks project out of the
big cube, but there should be no holes or gaps.

<h2>topology/fixed.point</h2>
A man hikes up a mountain, and starts hiking at 2:00 in the afternoon
on a Friday.  He does not hike at the same speed (a constant rate), and
stops every once in a while to look at the view.  He reaches the top in
4 hours.  After spending the night at the top, he leaves the next day
on the same trail at 2:00 in the afternoon.  Coming down, he doesn't
hike at a constant rate, and stops every once in a while to look at the
view.  It takes him 3 hours to get down the mountain.
