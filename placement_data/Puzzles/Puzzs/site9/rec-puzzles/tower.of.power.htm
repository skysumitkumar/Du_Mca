<h1>Solution to the /arithmetic/digits/least.significant/tower.of.power problem</h1>
<hr>
9^11 = 9 (mod 100), so we need to find 8^...^1 (mod 10).<br>
8^5 = 8 (mod 10), so we need to find 7^...^1 (mod 4).<br>
7^3 = 7 (mod 4), so we need to find 6^...^1 (mod 2), but
this is clearly 0, so 7^...^1 = 1 (mod 4) ==&gt;<br>
8^...^1 = 8 (mod 10) ==&gt; 9^...^1 = 9^8 (mod 100) = 21 (mod 100).
