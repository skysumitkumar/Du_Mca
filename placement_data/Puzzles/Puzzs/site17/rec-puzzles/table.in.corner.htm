<h1>Solution to the /geometry/table.in.corner problem</h1>
<hr>
Consider the +X axis and the +Y axis to be the corner.  The table has
radius r which puts the center of the circle at (r,r) and makes the
circle tangent to both axis.  The equation of the circle (table's
perimeter) is
<pre>
    (x-r)^2 + (y-r)^2 = r^2 .
</pre>

This leads to 
<pre>
     r^2 - 2(x+y) + x^2 + y^2 = 0
</pre>
Using x = 10, y = 5 we get the solutions 25 and 5.  The former is the
radius of the table.  It's diameter is 50 cm.

<p>
The latter number is the radius of a table that has a point which
satisfies the conditions but is not on the quarter circle nearest
the corner.
