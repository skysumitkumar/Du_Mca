At a recent trip to the Ontario Science Center in Toronto, Canada I came
across an interesting puzzle.  The center is located minutes from
downtown Toronto and it's a vast playground of science with hundreds of
exhibits inviting you to touch, try, test, and titillate your curiosity.
The puzzle I saw there can be stated as follows.  In the 10 boxes below,
write a 10-digit number.  The digit in the first box indicates the total
number of zeros in the entire number.  The box marked "1" indicates the
total number of 1's in the number.  The box marked "2" indicates the
total number of 2's in the number, and so on.  For example, the "3" in
the box labeled "0" would indicate that there must be exactly three 0's
in the 10-digit number.

-------------------------------
| 0| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8| 9|
| 3|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
-------------------------------


Stop And Think

1. Is there a solution to this problem?  Are there many solutions to this
problem?

2. A more advanced an interesting problem is to continue to
generate a sequence in a recursive fashion such that each row becomes
the sequence for the previous.  For example, start with the usual
0 through 9 digits in row 1:

Row 1: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

Assume Row 2 is your solution to the puzzle.  I've just inserted random
digits below so as not to give away the solution:


Row 1: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   S(1)
Row 2: 9 3 2 3 3 1 6 7 8 9   S(2)
Row 3:                       S(3)

Row 2 is now the starting point, and your next job is to form row 3, row 4,
etc. using the same rules.  In the previous example, a digit in the
first box would indicate how many 9's there are in the next 10-digit number,
and so forth.

Contest: I am looking for the longest sequence of numbers users can come
up with using these rules.  Can you find a Row 2 or Row 3?
Is it even possible to generate a "row 2" or "row 3"?

Consider a grid of infinitesimal dots spaced 1 inch apart in a cube with
an edge equal in length to the diameter of the sun (4.5x10**9 feet).
For conceptual purposes, you can think of the dots as having unit
spacing, being precisely placed at 1.00000...., 2.00000....,
3.00000...., etc. Next choose one of the dots and draw a line through it
which extends from that dot to the edge of the huge cube in both
directions.

Stop And Think

1. What is the probability that your line will intersect another dot
in the fine grid of dots within the cube the size of the sun?
Would your answer be different if the cube were the size of the
solar system?

2. Could a computer program be written to simulate this process?

3. Answer the two questions above, but this time assume the line
to have some finite thickness, T.

How many numbers have at least one digit -- a three?

In the first 10 numbers, 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 there is only one number
which contain the digit 3.  This means that 1/10 or 10% of the numbers
have the number 1 in the first 10 numbers.  In the first 100 numbers the
occurrence of numbers with at least one three seems to be growing.  In
fact there are 19 numbers:  3,13,23,33,43,53,63,73,83,93,
30,31,32,34,35,36,37,38,39.  This means that about 19% of the digits
contain the number 3 in the first 100 numbers.

We can make a table showing the percentage of numbers with
at least one 3-digit for the first N numbers.
N        %
10       1
100      19
1000     27
10000    34

The percentages rapidly increase to 100% indicating that almost all of
the numbers have a 3 in them!  In fact, a formula describing the
proportion of 3's can be written:  1-(9/10)**N.  The proportion gets
very close to 1 as N increases.

Stop And Think

1. How can it be that almost all of the numbers have a 3 in them?

Consider a chain of bottles (B) each connected to one another by a thin
tube. A marble is placed in bottle 1.
Each tube contains a one-way valve so marbles can only
go from left to right in the tubes which are symbolized with "-" marks:

1   2   3   4
B - B - B - B -


The tubes are thin so it takes
1 hour of constant random shaking to get the marble from B1 to B2.
Likewise for each bottle.

I have not fully described the bottle collection.  Each bottle
has a backward 1-way tube to bottle 1.  I've tried to diagram these
with "*" symbols.  Each time the marble enters bottle B(N) it has
a 50% probability of going back to bottle 1 via these tubes.

Stop And Think

1.  In how many hours will you expect to get the marble out of bottle 10
after placing the marble in bottle 1?

2. Is there a general formula for the amount of time
required to get the ball out of bottle N into bottle N+1 given
a probability P of backwards motion (given as 50% in this problem)?

3.  In how many hours will you expect to get the marble out of bottle 10
after placing the marble in bottle 1 given two backward tubes for each
bottle instead of one backward tube?

As many of you probably know, 5-sided stars produced by drawing a
continuous line with your pencil can nest inside each other.  (One star
can sit inside the pentagon produced by the larger star.  Each of the
5 points of the small star coincide with the 5 points of the
internal pentagon of the large star.)

Start with a five sided star formed with 5 line segments, each 1 inch
long.  Continually nest stars so that the assembly of stars gets bigger
and bigger.

Questions:
1.  How many nestings N are required to make star N
have an edge-length equal to the diameter of the sun (4.5E9 feet)?

2. How many nestings N are required to make the cumulative length
of lines of all the nested stars equal to the diameter of the sun?

Consider the 3x3 array below.  All nine digits are used exactly once.

1 9 2
3 8 4
5 7 6

Notice that "384" is twice the number in the first row, and that
"576" is three times the number in the first row.

Questions:
1.  Are there other ways of arranging the number to produce the same
result using each digit only once and the same rules?
Remember, the second row must be twice the first.  The third row
must be 3 times the first row.

2.  Start with the number in the last row (e.g "576" or any other
solution you may find) and continue to form another 3x3 matrix using the
same rules with the new starting number.  In other words, the number in
the second row must be twice the first.  The third row must be three
times the first.  (For this problem you may truncate any digits in the
beginning.  For example, 1384 would become 384.)

Keep going.  How many matrices can you create before it is impossible
to continue.  Again, each digit must be used only once
in each matrix.

   Many interesting observations have recently been published
concerning various number theory properties of the "number of the
beast", 666.  In this new
puzzle here I ask you to consider the monstrous
"leviathan number",
a number so large as to make the number of electrons,
protons, and neutrons in the universe (10**79) pale in comparison.  (It
also makes a googol (10**100) look kind of small).

The leviathan number is defined as (10**666)!, where the "!" indicates
factorial.

1.  What are the first 6 digits of the leviathan number?  Hint:  you
need not actually compute the leviathan to determine this.  If you can
determine the first 6 digits, please carefully spell out your method.

2. Could modern supercomputers compute the leviathan, or will this
beyond the realm of humankind for the next century?

3. Even if we cannot compute the leviathan, how many other
characteristics of this number can we write down.

Consider a metallic slide with 10 large holes in it equally spaced from
top to bottom.  If you attempt to slide down the slide you have a 50%
probability of sliding through each hole in the slide into an oleaginous
substance beneath the slide during each encounter with a hole.

1.  If you were a gambling person, which hole would you bet a person
would fall through?

2.  If you were a gambling person, how many attempts would it require
for a person to slide from the top of the slide to the bottom without
falling through a single hole.

3.  If all the people on earth lined up to go down the slide, and they

None.  The best chance is the first hole but I got a 50-50 chance.  Why
bother?  (2nd hole is 1/4, 3rd 2**-3, ...)

>2.  If you were a gambling person, how many attempts would it require

No gurantee.  Each slide is an independent event.  Now, if you are
talking mere probability, on the average, one in 1024 slides may make
it through all 10 holes.

>3.  If all the people on earth lined up to go down the slide, and they

Again, can't tell.  It could be the first one, it could be none.  Probablity
can not foretell actual events.  But if you have infinite number of people
sliding down till eternity, on the average, you may see 1 person slide over
all holes every (2**100)/(365*24*69*6) years.  This number is many times
bigger than the world population for now.

1.  How would the world be different today, geopolitically speaking, if
the ancient land masses had never drifted apart and, therefore,
today's world consisted of a single supercontintent?

2.  What would today's world be like if the land mass which formed the
Greek peninsula never existed?

3.  What would today's world be like if the land bridge which joined
Alaska to Asia never existed?

4.  Why do all the major peninsulas on earth point south?  See for
example:  Italy, Greece, Florida, and Baja, and the tips of Africa,
South America, India, Norway, Sweden, Greenland, and many other
landmasses.

Consider a 9x9 grid of beautiful crystal wineglasses.  Throw 32 cherries
at the grid.  A glass is considered occupied if it contains at least one
cherry.  (With each throw a cherry goes into one of the glasses.)  How
many different patterns of occupied glasses can you make?  (A glass with
more than one cherry is considered the same as a glass with one cherry
in the pattern).

2.  Same as above except that you place 8 cherries in glasses (x,y) and
then determine the other positions by placing cherries at (x,-y),
(-x,y), (-x,-y) leading to 32 cherries in the grid.  Consider the array
of glasses centered at the origin.  How many different patterns of
occupied glasses can you make?  (A glass with more than one cherry is
considered the same as a glass with one cherry in the pattern).

3. Can your results be extrapolated to an NxN grid with M cherries
thrown at it for both problems?

A square number is of the form y=x**2.  For example, 25 is a square
number.

Undulating numbers are of the form:  ababababab... For example, the
following are undulating numbers:  1717171, 282828, etc.

1. Are there any undulating square numbers?

2. Are there any undulating cube numbers?

Consider the simple yet weird recursive formula

a(n) = a(a(n-1)) + a(n-a(n-1))

The sequences starts with a(1) = 1, and a(2) = 1.  The "future" values
at higher values of n depend on past values in intricate recursive ways.
Can you determined the third member of the sequence?  At first, this may
seem a little complicated to evaluate, but you can being slowly, by
inserting values for n, as in the following:

a(3) = a(a(2)) + a(3-a(2))
a(3) = a(1) + a(3-1) =
a(3) = 1+1 = 2

Therefore, the 3rd value of the sequence a(3) is 2.

The sequence a(n) seems simple enough: 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, ...
Try computing a few additional numbers.  Can you find any interesting
patterns?  The prolific mathematician John H Conway presented this
recursive sequence at a recent talk entitled "Some Crazy Sequences."  He
noticed that the value a(n)/n approaches 1/2 as the sequence grows and n
becomes larger.  Can you find a value, N, above which the sequence the
value of a(n)/n is always within 0.05 of the value 1/2?  (In other
words,
.eq vbar a(n)/n -1/2 vbar lt 0.05.
The bars indicate the absolute value.)

   A difficult problem? you ask.
John Conway offered $10,000 to the person to find the s-m-a-l-l-e-s-t
such N. A month after Conway made the offer, Colin Mallows of AT&T
solved the $10,000 question:  N = 3,173,375,556.  Manfred Shroeder has
noted that the sequence is "replete with appealing self-similarities
that contain the clue to the problem's solution."  Can you find any
self-similarities?  As I write this, no-one on the planet has found a
value for the smallest N such that a(n)/n is always within 0.01 of the
value 1/2.
.eq (vbar a(n)/n -1/2 vbar lt 0.01. )

Consider the following nested set of square roots.

.eq ? = sqrt <1 + G sqrt <1+(G+1) sqrt < 1 + ... >>>

Here, G indicates "Googol" or  10**100.
The "<" and ">" symbols indicate where the beginning and ends of the
the nested roots.

1. What is the value for in this infinite set of nested roots.
2. What is the next term under the root?

Hint:
In 1911, the famous mathematical prodigy Srinivasa Ramanujan posed the
following question (#298) in a new mathematical journal called the
:Journal of the Indian Mathematical Society.

.eq ? = sqrt <1 + 2 sqrt <1+3 sqrt <1 + ... >>>
