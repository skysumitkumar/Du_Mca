A poem:
Mood's mode!
Pallas, I won!
(Diaper pane, sold entire.)
Melt till ever sere, hide it.
Drown a more vile note;
(Tar of rennet.)
Ah, trowel, baton, eras ago.
The reward? A "nisi." Two nag.

Otary tastes putrid, yam was green.
Odes up and on; stare we.
Rats nod. Nap used one-erg saw.
(May dirt upset satyr?)

A toga now; 'tis in a drawer, eh?
Togas are notable.
(Worth a tenner for Ate`.)
Tone liver. O Man, word-tied I.

Here's revel!
Little merit, Ned? Lose, Nap?
Repaid now is all apedom's doom.

Line palindrome poems:

    As I was passing near the jail
    I met a man, but hurried by.
    His face was ghastly, grimly pale.
    He had a gun.  I wondered why
    He had.  A gun?  I wondered... why,
    His face was *ghastly*!  Grimly pale,
    I met a man, but hurried by,
    As I was passing near the jail.

		DOPPELGANGER  (umlaut on the A)

    Entering the lonely house with my wife,
      I saw him for the first time
    Peering furtively from behind a bush--
	    Blackness that moved,
      A shape amid the shadows,
    A momentary glimpse of gleaming eyes
      Revealed in the ragged moon.
    A closer look (he seemed to turn) might have
    Put him to flight forever--
      I dared not
    (For reasons that I failed to understand),
      Though I knew I should act at once.

    I puzzled over it, hiding alone,
    Watching the woman as she neared the gate.
      He came, and I saw him crouching
	    Night after night.
	    Night after night
      He came, and I saw him crouching,
    Watching the woman as she neared the gate.

    I puzzled over it, hiding alone--
      Though I knew I should act at once,
    For reasons that I failed to understand
		I dared not
	    Put him to flight forever.
    A closer look (he seemed to turn) might have
      Revealed in the ragged moon
    A momentary glimpse of gleaming eyes,
      A shape amid the shadows,
	    Blackness that moved.

    Peering furtively from behind a bush,
      I saw him, for the first time,
    Entering the lonely house with my wife.
