<h1>Solution to the /language/english/synonyms/contradictory.proverbs problem</h1>

<pre>
Beware of Greeks bearing gifts.
Never look a gift horse in the mouth.

Look before you leap.
He who hesitates is lost.

Nothing venture, nothing gain.
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread.

Seek and ye shall find.
Curiosity killed the cat.

Save for a rainy day.
Tomorrow will take care of itself.

Life is what we make it.
What is to be will be.

Too many cooks spoil the broth.
Many hands make light work.

One man's meat is another man's poison.
Sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.

With age comes wisdom.
Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings come all wise sayings.

Bear ye one another's burdens. (Gal. 6:2)
For every man shall bear his own burden. (Gal. 6:5)

Great minds run in the same channel.
Fools think alike.

A rolling stone gathers no moss.
A setting hen never lays.

A hollow pot makes the most noise.
The squeaky wheel gets the grease.

Faint heart never won fair lady.
The meek shall inherit the Earth.

To thine own self be true.
The nail that stands out gets hammered down.
