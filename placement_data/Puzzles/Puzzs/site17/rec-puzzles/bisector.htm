PROVE: &lt;ABC = &lt;BCA (i.e. triangle ABC is an isosceles triangle)

                       A
                      / \
                     /   \
                    D     E            XP normal to AB
                   / \   / \           XQ normal to AC
                P /----X----\ Q
                 /   /   \   \
                /  /       \  \
               / /           \ \
              B/_______________\C

<h3>PROOF:</h3>
  Let XP and XQ be normals to AC and AB.
  Since the three angle bisectors are concurrent, AX bisects angle A
  also and therefore XP = XQ.

  <p>
  Let's assume XD &gt; XE.
  Then ang(PDX) &lt; ang(QEX)
  Now considering triangles BXD and CXE,
    the last condition requires that
       ang(DBX) &gt; ang(ECX)<br>
OR     ang(XBC) &gt; ang(XCB)<br>
OR        XC    &gt;  XB

   <p>
   Thus our assumption leads to :
        XC + XD &gt;  XE + XB<br>
OR         CD  &gt; BE<br>
  which is a contradiction.


  <p>
  Similarly, one can show that XD &lt; XE leads to a contradiction too.

<p>
Hence  XD = XE  =&gt; CX = BX
From which it is easy to prove that the triangle is isosceles.
