<h2>The Allais Paradox</h2>
The Allais Paradox involves the choice between two alternatives:

<ol>
	<li> 89% chance of an unknown amount<br>
	   10% chance of $1 million<br>
	   1% chance of $1 million
	<li> 89% chance of an unknown amount (the same amount as in A)<br>
	   10% chance of $2.5 million<br>
	   1% chance of nothing
</ol>

What is the rational choice?  Does this choice remain the same if the
unknown amount is $1 million?  If it is nothing?

<h2>N-Person Fair Division</h2>

If two people want to divide a pie but do not trust each other, they can
still ensure that each gets a fair share by using the technique that one
person cuts and the other person chooses. Generalize this technique
to more than two people. Take care to ensure that no one can be cheated
by a coalition of the others.

<h2>Sultan's Dowry</h2>

A sultan has granted a commoner a chance to marry one of his hundred
daughters. The commoner will be presented the daughters one at a time.
When a daughter is presented, the commoner will be told the daughter's
dowry. The commoner has only one chance to accept or reject each
daughter; he cannot return to a previously rejected daughter.
The sultan's catch is that the commoner may only marry the daughter with
the highest dowry. What is the commoner's best strategy assuming
he knows nothing about the distribution of dowries?

<a name="envelope"><h2>envelope</h2></a>
Someone has prepared two envelopes containing money.  One contains twice as
much money as the other.  You have decided to pick one envelope, but then the
following argument occurs to you:  Suppose my chosen envelope contains $X,
then the other envelope either contains $X/2 or $2X.  Both cases are
equally likely, so my expectation if I take the other envelope is
.5 * $X/2 + .5 * $2X = $1.25X, which is higher than my current $X, so I
should change my mind and take the other envelope.  But then I can apply the
argument all over again.  Something is wrong here!  Where did I go wrong?

<p>
In a variant of this problem, you are allowed to peek into the envelope
you chose before finally settling on it.  Suppose that when you peek you
see $100.  Should you switch now?

<h2>exchange</h2>
At one time, the Canadian and US dollars were discounted by 10 cents on
each side of the border (i.e., a Canadian dollar was worth 90 US cents
in the US, and a US dollar was worth 90 Canadian cents in Canada).  A
man walks into a bar on the US side of the border, orders 10 US cents
worth of beer, pays with a US dollar and receives a Canadian dollar in
change.  He then walks across the border to Canada, orders 10 Canadian
cents worth of beer, pays with a Canadian dollar and receives a US
dollar in change.  He continues this throughout the day, and ends up
dead drunk with the original dollar in his pocket.

<p>
Who pays for the drinks?

<h2>high.or.low</h2>
I pick two numbers, randomly, and tell you one of them. You are supposed
to guess whether this is the lower or higher one of the two numbers I
picked. Can you come up with a method of guessing that does better than
picking the response "low" or "high" randomly (i.e. probability to guess
right > .5) ?

<a name="monty.hall"><h2>monty.hall</h2></a>
You are a participant on "Let's Make a Deal." Monty Hall shows you
three closed doors.  He tells you that two of the closed doors have a
goat behind them and that one of the doors has a new car behind it.
You pick one door, but before you open it, Monty opens one of the two
remaining doors and shows that it hides a goat.  He then offers you a
chance to switch doors with the remaining closed door.  Is it to your
advantage to do so?

<h2>Newcomb's Problem</h2>

A being put one thousand dollars in box A and either zero or one million
dollars in box B and presents you with two choices:
<ol>
	<li> Open box B only.
	<li> Open both box A and B.
</ol>
The being put money in box B only if it predicted you will choose option (1).
The being put nothing in box B if it predicted you will do anything other than
choose option (1) (including choosing option (2), flipping a coin, etc.).

<p>
Assuming that you have never known the being to be wrong in predicting your
actions, which option should you choose to maximize the amount of money you
get?

<h2>prisoners</h2>
Three prisoners on death row are told that one of them has been chosen
at random for execution the next day, but the other two are to be
freed.  One privately begs the warden to at least tell him the name of
one other prisoner who will be freed.  The warden relents: 'Susie will
go free.'  Horrified, the first prisoner says that because he is now
one of only two remaining prisoners at risk, his chances of execution
have risen from one-third to one-half!  Should the warden have kept his
mouth shut?

<h2>red</h2>
I show you a shuffled deck of standard playing cards, one card at a
time.  At any point before I run out of cards, you must say "RED!".
If the next card I show is red (i.e. diamonds or hearts), you win.  We
assume I the "dealer" don't have any control over what the order of
cards is.

<p>
The question is, what's the best strategy, and what is your
probability of winning ?

<h2>rotating.table</h2>
Four glasses are placed in the four corners of a square rotating table,
each glass is either up or down.  You wish to turn them all in the same
direction, either all up or all down.  You may do so by grasping any two
glasses and, optionally, turning either over.  There are two catches:
you are blindfolded and the table is spun after each time you touch the
glasses.  Assuming that a bell rings when you have them all facing the 
same way, how do you do it?

<h2>stpetersburg</h2>
What should you be willing to pay to play a game in which the payoff is
calculated as follows:  a coin is flipped until it comes up heads on the
nth toss and the payoff is set at 2^n dollars?

<h2>truel</h2>
A, B, and C are to fight a three-cornered pistol duel.  All know that
A's chance of hitting his target is 0.3, C's is 0.5, and B never misses.
They are to fire at their choice of target in succession in the order
A, B, C, cyclically (but a hit man loses further turns and is no longer
shot at) until only one man is left.  What should A's strategy be?
