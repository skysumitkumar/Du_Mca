<h1>Solution to the /lateral/4 problem</h1>
<hr>
     The man had jumped from a plane but his parachute had failed to open.  
     It is the unopened package.
     
     <p>
     This is sometimes given with the following rather elegant clue - as he 
     approached the centre of the field he knew he was going to die.  This 
     is another of the top classics which is right up there with 'The Man 
     in the Bar'.  If the solver is thinking along the wrong lines (i.e. in 
     the two dimensions of the ground) then the lateral jump to the third 
     dimension can be tough to make.
