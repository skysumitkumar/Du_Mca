<h1>Solution to the /geometry/trigonometry/inequality problem</h1>
<hr>
The function f(x) = x^(1/sqrt(1-x^2)) is monotonically increasing for
0 &lt; x &lt; 1, easily verified by taking the derivative. 
Since 0 &lt; sin x &lt; cos x &lt; 1 for 0 &lt; x &lt; pi/4, f(sin x) &lt; f(cos x).
<p>
But f(sin x) = (sin x)^(1/cos x) and f(cos x) = (cos x)^(1/sin x).
Raising both sides to the power (cos x.sin x), we get the desired
result.
