<h1>Solution to the /competition/tests/analogies/long problem</h1>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>  Lyssophobia <br>

Cynophobia is the fear of dogs; lyssophobia is the fear of rabies.  As
Rodney Adams pointed out, a word meaning the fear of fleas would be
even better, but I've been unable to locate such a word (although
surely one must exists).

<li>  Homalocephalic <br>

Acrocephalic is having a pointed head; homalocephalic is having a flat
head.  Rodney Adamas suggested "planoccipital", but on checking this
apparently refers to having a flat back of the skull, so he only gets
partial credit.

<li>  Galeanthropist <br>

A philofelist is a cat-lover (also commonly called an ailurophile);
a galeanthropist is a person who believes they are a cat.

<li>  Blue Bird <br>

A Camp Fire Girl who is 4 is in the Bumblebee Club; a Campfire Girl
who is 6 in the Blue Bird Club.  I should have had "4 or 5" instead
of "4" to remove ambiguity (e.g. Mark Brader suggested "triplane").

<li>  Brigadier <br>

A 2-star general in the army is a major general; a 1-star general
in the army is a brigadier general.

<li>  Field Army <br>

Army groupings; there are 24 "groups" in a "field army".

<li>  Hemidemisemiquaver <br>

A crotchet is a quarter-note; a hemidemisemiquaver is a sixty-fourth
note.  Rodney Adams and Mark Brader both got this.

<li>  Prestissimo <br>

In music prestissimo means extremely fast; grave means very slow to
the point of solemnity.  This question was poorly worded (I received
both "womb" and "cradle" as answers).

<li>  Seraph <br>

In the ninefold hierarchy of angels, a throne ranks 7th and a seraph
9th (9th being most powerful).  Rodney Adams got this one.

<li>  Sonneillon <br>

In Father Sebastien Machaelis's (one of the more famous exorcists)
hierarchy of devils, Beelzebub is responsible for pride, Sonneillon
for hatred.

<li>  Roosevelt <br>

Grant is on the $50 bill; Roosevelt on the $50 savings bond.

<li>  10^14 <br>

Ek is 1 in Hindi; sankh is 10^14 (one hundred quadrillion).
