This is not another travelling salesman - it is merely finding the diameter of 
connected components of that graph.  The simple algorithm for this is to do 
one depth first search from each word, resulting in an O(n*m) worst case 
algorithm (where n is the number of words, and m is the number of arcs).  In 
practice, it is actually somewhat better, since the graph breaks down into 
many connected components.  However, the diameters (and solutions) depend on 
what dictionary is used.  Here are the results from various dictionaries:

From /usr/dict/words (restricted to words all lower case alphabetical) (19,694 
words): sixth - hubby (46 steps)

From the official scrabble players dictionary (94,276 words): effaces - 
cabaret (57 steps)

From the british official scrabble words (134,051 words): vainest - infulae 
(73 steps)

From webster's ninth new collegiate dictionary (abridged) (78, 167 words): 
griming - goblets (56 steps)

From all of the above, merged  (180,676 words): vainest - injects (58 steps)

To see the effect the dictionary has on paths, here are the lengths of the 
shortest paths these pairs, and for the ones mentioned in previous posts, for 
each dictionary (a - means that there is no path using only words from that 
dictionary):

                  UDW OSPD OSW  W9 ALL
    hit - ace      5    3   3   5   3
    pig - sty      -    5   4   5   4
   four - five     6    6   5   7   5
   play - game     8    7   7   8   7
  green - grass   13    4   4   7   4
  wheat - bread    6    6   6   6   6
  sixth - hubby   46    9   9   -   9
effaces - cabaret  -   57   -   -  33
vainest - infulae  -    -  73   -  52
griming - goblets  -   22  19  56  15
vainest - injects  -    -  72   -  58
