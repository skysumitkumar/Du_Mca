<h1>Solution to the /induction/handshake problem</h1>
<hr>
Assume there were 2n people (including host and hostess)
in the party.

<ol>
<li> When the host asked the question he must have got
   2n-1 responses (including from his wife).

<li> All of the responses were different.
</ol>
The responses have to be (0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 2n-2)
to satisfy the above requirements. As 2n-2 is the maximum
possible handshakes any person in this party could have made.

<pre>
/**   Below,
      P{x} - means a person who shook x hands.
      H    - means the host
 **/

H: &lt;--------&gt;2n-2   0
	   2n-3        1
          2n-4          2
	  2n-5          3
          .             .
           .           .
             .       .
	      n  n-1 n-2
</pre>
		(There are 2n-1 on the circle.)

<p>
P{2n-2} must have handshaked with H (because in the circle he
can handshake with only 2n-3. He has to exclude himself also.)

<p>
P{2n-3} must have handshaked with H (because in the circle he
can handshake with only 2n-4.)

<p>
P{2n-4} must have handshaked with H (because in the circle he
can handshake with only 2n-5.)

<p>
P{n} must have handshaked with H (because in the circle he
can handshake with only n-1.)

<p>
from P{n-1} to P{0} nobody  handshakes with H, because, for them
the handshake numbers are satisfied on the circle itself.

<p>
This leaves H with (n-1) handshakes.
<hr>

P{0} must be the spouse of P{2n-2} (since P{2n-2} handshakes with
everbody else.)<br>
.<br>
.<br>
.<br>
same logic till P{n-2}
<p>
leaving the Hostess to be P{n-1}.

<hr>
So,<br>
Host    - made (n-1) handshakes.<br>
Hostess - made (n-1) handshakes.

<p>
where n is the number of couple including
the host couple.
