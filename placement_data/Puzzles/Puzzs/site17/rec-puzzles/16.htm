<h1>Solution to the /lateral/16 problem</h1>

     The blind beggar was the sister of her brother who died.
     
     <p>
     This puzzle is one of a type that depends on the listener making 
     implicit assumptions about gender - in this case that a blind beggar 
     is a man.  Similar puzzles involve surgeons who refuse to operate on 
     their sons etc.  This is probably the best of the class because it is 
     very simply stated and yet which has the power to baffle those who 
     have not heard it before.
