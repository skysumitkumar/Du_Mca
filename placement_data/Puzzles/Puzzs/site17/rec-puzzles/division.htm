<h1>Solution to the /decision/division problem</h1>
<hr>
<h2>N-Person Fair Division</h2>

Number the people from 1 to N. Person 1 cuts off a piece of the pie.
Person 2 can either diminish the size of the cut off piece or pass.
The same for persons 3 through N. The last person to touch the piece
must take it and is removed from the process. Repeat this procedure
with the remaining N - 1 people, until everyone has a piece.

There is a cute result in combinatorics called the Marriage Theorem.
A village has n men and n women, such that for all 0 &lt; k &lt;= n and for any
set of k men there are at least k women, each of whom is in love with at least
one of the k men.  All of the men are in love with all of the women :-}.
The theorem asserts that there is a way to arrange the village into n
monogamous couplings.

<p>
The Marriage Theorem can be applied to the Fair Pie-Cutting Problem.

<p>
One player cuts the pie into n pieces.  Each of the players labels
some non-null subset of the pieces as acceptable to him.  For reasons
given below he should "accept" each piece of size &gt; 1/n, not just the
best piece(s).  The pie-cutter is required to "accept" all of the pieces.

<p>
Given a set S of players let S' denote the set of pie-pieces
acceptable to at least one player in S.  Let t be the size of the largest
set (T) of players satisfying  |T| &gt; |T'|.  If there is no such set, the
Marriage Theorem can be applied directly.  Since the pie-cutter accepts
every piece we know that  t &lt; n.

<p>
Choose  |T| - |T'|  pieces at random from outside T', glue them
together with the pieces in T' and let the players in T repeat the game
with this smaller (t/n)-size pie.  This is fair since they all rejected
the other n-t pieces, so they believe this pie is larger than t/n.

<p>
The remaining n-t players can each be assigned one of the remaining
n-t pie-pieces without further ado due to the Marriage Theorem.  (Otherwise
the set T above was not maximal.)

<p>
The problem of getting not just a fair solution, but an envy-free solution,
is not solved.  A reference to this problem:<br>
