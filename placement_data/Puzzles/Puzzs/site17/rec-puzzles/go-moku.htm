<h1>Solution to the /competition/games/go-moku problem</h1>
<hr>
Berlekamp, Conway, and Guy's _Winning_Ways_ reports proof that the
maximum k is between 4 and 7 inclusive, and it appears to be 5 or 6.
They report:

<ul>
<li> 4-in-a-row is a draw on a 5x5 board (C. Y. Lee), but not on a 4x30
    board (C. Lustenberger).

<li> N-in-a-row is shown to be a draw on a NxN board for N&gt;4, using a
    general pairing technique devised by A. W. Hales and R. I. Jewett.

<li> 9-in-a-row is a draw even on an infinite board, a 1954 result of H. O.
    Pollak and C. E. Shannon. 

<li> More recently, the pseudonymous group T. G. L. Zetters showed that
    8-in-a-row is a draw on an infinite board, and have made some
    progress on showing infinite 7-in-a-row to be a draw.
</ul>

Go-moku is 5-in-a-row played on a 19x19 go board.  It is apparently a
win for the first player, and so the Japanese have introduced several
'handicaps' for the first player (e.g., he must win with _exactly_
five: 6-in-a-row doesn't count), but apparently the game is still a win
for the first player.  None of these apparent results have been
proven.
