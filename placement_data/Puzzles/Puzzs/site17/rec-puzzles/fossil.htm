<h1>Solution to the /language/english/etymology/fossil problem</h1>
<hr>
<pre>
These are called fossil expresions -- words that have dropped out of
common use but hang around in idioms.  Not all of them are separate
words, some are part of other words or have prefixes or suffixes
attached.  There are also words which have current meaning, but the
meaning in the idiom is unrelated to it.
