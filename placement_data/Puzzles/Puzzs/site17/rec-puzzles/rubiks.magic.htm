<h1>Solution to the /competition/games/rubiks/rubiks.magic problem</h1>
<hr>
The solution is in a 3x3 grid with a corner missing.

<pre>
+---+---+---+          +---+---+---+---+
| 3 | 5 | 7 |          | 1 | 3 | 5 | 7 |
+---+---+---+          +---+---+---+---+
| 1 | 6 | 8 |          | 2 | 4 | 6 | 8 |
+---+---+---+          +---+---+---+---+
| 2 | 4 |              Original Shape
+---+---+
</pre>

To get the 2x4 "standard" shape into this shape, follow this:
<ol>
<li>  Lie it flat in front of you (4 going across).
<li>  Flip the pair (1,2) up and over on top of (3,4).
<li>  Flip the ONE square (2) up and over (1).
[Note:  if step 3 won't go, start over, but flip the entire original shape
        over (exposing the back).]
<li>  Flip the pair (2,4) up and over on top of (5,6).
<li>  Flip the pair (1,2) up and toward you on top of (blank,4).
<li>  Flip the ONE square (2) up and left on top of (1).
<li>  Flip the pair (2,4) up and toward you. 
</ol> 
Your puzzle won't be completely solved, but this is how to get the shape.
Notice that 3,5,6,7,8 don't move.
