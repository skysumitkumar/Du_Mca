<h1>Solution to the /arithmetic/clock/reversible problem</h1>
<hr>
Have 12 clocks C1, C2 ... C12 show 1:00, 2:00, ..., 12:00.  Have a
clock C0 show 12:00

<p>
Now turn C0 around 12 hours, simultaneously turning C1-C12 so their
hour hands always coincide with the minute hand of C0, i.e., as C0
spans 12 hours, C1-C12 will span 1 hour, but for each possible placing
of the hour hand, all 12 possible 'true' placings of the minute hand
will be represented by one of the 12 clocks.

<p>
Each time the hour hand of C0 coincides with the minute hand of a
C1-C12 clock we have a reversible valid time.  This happens regularly
12 times each C0 hour, but the first and last time is equal (12:00), so
the number of reversible true times is 12*12-1 = 143 spaced regularly
in the 12-hour interval, ie. each 5 min 2.0979+ sec
