<h1>Solution to the /analysis/rubberband problem</h1>
<hr>
Let w = speed of bug and N = ratio of car speed/bug speed = 100.  Paint N+1
equally spaced stripes on the rubberband.  When the bug is standing on one
stripe, the next stripe is moving away from him at a speed slightly &lt; w
(relative to him).  Since he is walking at w, clearly the bug can reach
the next stripe.  But once he reaches that stripe, the next one is only
receeding at &lt; w.  So he walks on down to the car, one stripe at a time.

<p>
The bug starts gaining on the car when he is at the next to last stripe.
