<h1>Solution to the /arithmetic/arithmetic.progression problem</h1>
<hr>
There is an arithmetic progression of 21 primes:
<pre>
    142072321123 + 1419763024680 i, 0 &lt;= i &lt; 21.
</pre>
It was discovered on 30 November 1990, by programs running in the background
on a network of Sun 3 workstations in the Department of Computer Science,
University of Queensland, Australia.
