<h2>balloon</h2>
<pre>A helium-filled balloon is tied to the floor of a car that makes a
sharp right turn.  Does the balloon tilt while the turn is made?
If so, which way?  The windows are closed so there is no connection
with the outside air.

At the other end hangs a monkey of equal weight.  What happens if
the monkey starts to ascend the rope?  Assume that the mass of the
rope and pulley are negligible, and the pulley is frictionless.

<h2>pole.in.barn</h2>
<pre>Accelerate a pole of length l to a constant speed of 90% of the speed of
light (.9c).  Move this pole towards an open barn of length .9l (90%
the length of the pole).  Then, as soon as the pole is fully inside the
barn, close the door.  What do you see and what actually happens?

of unit resistors in the shape of a
1. Square with all vertices connected,
2. Platonic solid,

<h2>sail</h2>
<pre>A sailor is in a sailboat on a river.  The current is 3 knots with respect
to the land.  The wind (air velocity) is zero, with respect to the
land.  The sailor wants to proceed downriver as quickly as possible,
maximizing his downstream speed with respect to the land.

Should he raise the sail, or not?
