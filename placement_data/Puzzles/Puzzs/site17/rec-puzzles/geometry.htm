course at all times. There is no wind, G does not have radio or radar,
there is enough space for maneuvering, etc.

<h2>tetrahedron</h2>
<pre>Suppose you have a sphere of radius R and you have four planes that are
all tangent to the sphere such that they form an arbitrary tetrahedron
(it can be irregular).  What is the ratio of the surface area of the
tetrahedron to its volume?
