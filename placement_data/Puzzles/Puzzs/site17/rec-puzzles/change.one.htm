<h1>Solution to the /arithmetic/digits/prime/change.one problem</h1>
<hr>
200.  Obviously, you would have to change the last digit, but 201, 203,
207, and 209 are all composite.  For any smaller number, you can change
the last digit, and get
2,11,23,31,41,53,61,71,83,97,101,113,127,131,149,151,163,173,181, or 191.

<p>
200+2310n gives an infinite family, because changing the last
digit to 1 or 7 gives a number divisible by 3; to 3, a number divisible
by 7; to 9, a number divisible by 11.
