<h1>Solution to the /arithmetic/consecutive.product problem</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Three consecutive numbers:</h2>
  If a and b are relatively prime, and ab is a square,
  then a and b are squares. (This is left as an exercise.)

<p>
  Suppose (n - 1)n(n + 1) = k^2, where n &gt; 1.  
  Then n(n^2 - 1) = k^2.  But n and (n^2 - 1) are relatively prime.
  Therefore n^2 - 1 is a perfect square, which is a contradiction.

<h2>Four consecutive numbers:</h2>
  n(n + 1)(n + 2)(n + 3) = (n^2 + 3n + 1)^2 - 1

<h2>Five consecutive numbers:</h2>
  Assume the product is a integer square, call it m.

<p>
  The prime factorization of m must have even numbers of each prime factor.

<p>
  For each prime factor, p, of m, p &gt;= 5, p^2k must divide one of the
consecutive naturals in the product.  (Otherwise, the difference between two
of the naturals in the product would be a positive multiple of a prime &gt;= 5.
But in this problem, the greatest difference is 4.) So we need only consider
the primes 2 and 3.

<p>
  Each of the consecutive naturals is one of:
<pre>
   1)	a perfect square
   2)	2 times a perfect square
   3)	3 times a perfect square
   4)	6 times a perfect square.
</pre>
  By the shoe box principle, two of the five consecutive numbers must fall into
the same category.

<p>
  If there are two perfect squares, then their difference being less than five
limits their values to be 1 and 4.  (0 is not a natural number, so 0 and 1
and 0 and 4 cannot be the perfect squares.)  But 1*2*3*4*5=120!=x*x where x
is an integer.

<p>
  If there are two numbers that are 2 times a perfect square, then their
difference being less than five implies that the perfect squares (which are
multiplied by 2) are less than 3 apart, and no two natural squares differ by
only 1 or 2.

<p>
  A similar argument holds for two numbers which are 3 times a perfect square.

<p>
  We cannot have the case that two of the 5 consecutive numbers are multiples
(much less square multiples) of 6, since their difference would be &gt;= 6, and
our span of five consecutive numbers is only 4.

<p>
  Therefore the assumption that m is a perfect square does not hold.

<p>
  QED.

<p>
In general the equation:

<pre>
y^2 = x(x+1)(x+2)...(x+n),    n &gt; 3
</pre>

has only the solution corresponding to y = 0.

<p>
This is a theorem of Rigge [O. Rigge, ``Uber ein diophantisches Problem'',
IX Skan. Math. Kong. Helsingfors (1938)] and Erdos [P. Erdos, ``Note on
products of consecutive integers,'' J. London Math. Soc. #14 (1939),
pages 194-198].

A proof can be found on page 276 of [L. Mordell, ``Diophantine
Equations'', Academic Press 1969].
