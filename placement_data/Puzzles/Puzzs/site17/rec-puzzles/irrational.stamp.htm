<h1>Solution to the /analysis/irrational.stamp problem</h1>
<hr>
Yes.  Center the stamp at (0,0), (1,0), and (0,pi).

<p>
Suppose there is a point (x,y) which is not covered.
Then there are rational numbers a,b,c satisfying the following equations:
<ol>
  <li><pre>   x^2   +   y^2     =  a</pre>
  <li><pre> (x-1)^2 +   y^2     =  b</pre>
  <li><pre>   x^2   + (y-pi)^2  =  c</pre>
</ol>
Subtract (2) from (1) and solve for x.  Thus x is rational.
From equation (2), y is algebraic.  But equation (3) implies
that y is transcendental, contradiction.
