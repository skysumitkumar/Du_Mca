<h1>Solution to the /geometry/trigonometry/euclidean.numbers problem</h1>
<hr>

Numbers generated by +, -, *, /, and sqrt from the integers are the
Euclidean numbers, so called because they are those for which line
segments can be constructed by use of straightedge and compass the
ratio of whose lengths has that value.

<p>
Using degrees, sin (360*M/N) (where (M,N)=1) is Euclidean if and only
if the regular polygon with N sides can be constructed by straightedge
and compass. This is true if (Gauss) and only if (easier) N is a power
of 2 times the product of different Fermat primes (3, 5, 17, 257, 65537
and probably no more). So sin (3/17) = sin (360/(2^3*3*5*17)) is
Euclidean, for example.

<p>
Some particular values:

<pre>
   sin(54) = (1 + sqrt(5))/4  
   sin(3) = sqrt(8 - sqrt(3) - sqrt(15) - sqrt(10 - 2*sqrt(5)))/4
</pre>
