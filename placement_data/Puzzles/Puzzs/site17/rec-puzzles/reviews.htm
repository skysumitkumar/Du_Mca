Presenting... the Game Bytes Issues Index!   (Issues 1-8)

<p>
Game Bytes has covered well over 100 games in the past several issues. 
Using this index, you can look up the particular games you're interested
in, find out what issues of Game Bytes cover them, and download those
issues.  Also included is a list of the interviews GB has done to date -
- the interviews from several issues ago still contain a lot of current
material.

<p>
The easiest way to use the games index is to employ the search command
of your favorite word processor to find a distinctive string, such as
"Ultima","Perfect", or "Lemmings".  The list is alphabetized; series
have been listed together rather than by individual subtitle.  

<p>
All issues of Game Bytes to date are available by anonymous FTP at
ftp.ulowell.edu in the <a href="javascript:if(confirm('ftp://ftp.ulowell.edu/msdos/Games/GameByte  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it did not meet the project\'s file type specifications.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='ftp://ftp.ulowell.edu/msdos/Games/GameByte'" tppabs="ftp://ftp.ulowell.edu/msdos/Games/GameByte">
/msdos/Games/GameByte</a> directory and are
