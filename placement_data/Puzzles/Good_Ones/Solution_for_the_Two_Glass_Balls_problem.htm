<CENTER>Two Glass Balls</A></CENTER></H3>
<P>I am in a 100-story building. I have with me two glass balls. I know that if 
I throw the ball out of the window it will never breaks if the floor number is 
less than X and it will always breaks if the floor number is equal or greater 
than X. Assuming that I can reuse the balls which didn't break, find X in a 
minimum number of throws. <BR>

<CENTER>Solution</A></CENTER></H3>
<P>Suppose we have a strategy with N trows. Then the floor is defined by two 
numbers: the trow, when the first ball breaks, and the trow, when the second 
ball breaks. The sum of those two numbers should be less or equal to N. Hence 
the number of floors we can distinguish is the number of different pairs of such 
numbers, which is equal to N(N+1)/2. This number should be more than 99. Hence, 
we need at least 14 trows. 
<P>Now we would like to build a strategy. To decide the floor for our first 
throw we observe that if the ball breaks we need to decide between the leftover 
floors in 13 steps. Which means to maximize our choices for the case when it 
doesn't break we need to use all the opportunities. That is we should throw the 
ball from the 14th floor first. If it breaks we use the second ball starting 
from the first floor up. 
<P>Second throw should be from the 14 + 13 = 27th floor. And so on. <BR>
