queues, lists, trees, sets and graphs; algorithm for tree and graphs traversals, 
connected component, spanning trees, shortest paths; hashing, sorting and searching 
algorithm design and analysis techniques, big 'oh' notation, solution of sample 
recurrence relations.

LANGUAGE PROCESSOR:

scope rules and parameter passing mechanism; compilers lexical analysis, parsing, 
syntax, directed translation, run time environment, machine code generation; 
interpreters.

OPERATING SYSTEM:

process synchoronization and concurrency, deadlocks, protection.

DATABASE SYSTEM: 

File organization techniques; indexing,B-trees, B-plus trees; relational and 
network datat models; normal forms; query language: SQL.
