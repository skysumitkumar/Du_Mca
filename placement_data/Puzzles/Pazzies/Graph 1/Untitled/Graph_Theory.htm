  A circuit is a path that starts and ends at the same point. An Euler path or

<p><b>            The Bridges of Konigsburg.  (1 Day)</b></p>
<p><b>            </b>One of the classic problems in Graph Theory is the Bridges 
  of Konigsburg.  Konigsburg is a city in Germany with seven bridges joining various 
  parts of the city across the Pregel River (see figure below).   </p>

        though, Königsburg is best known because of a puzzle associated with its 
        seven bridges, which were located roughly as illustrated on the right. 
        Its citizens pondered for a long time whether it was possible to walk 
        about the city in such a way that you cross all seven bridges (yellow 
        in diagram) exactly once. </span><span style='font-family:Arial;"Arial Unicode MS";color:#003300'></span></p>

<p>As mentioned above, on a pleasant afternoon, a favorite pastime of people in 
  Konigsburg was to try and walk a path across each bridge and return to their 
  starting point crossing each bridge exactly one time.  The great mathematician 
  Euler (pronounced “oiler”) realized that this task could be treated a problem 
  in Graph Theory by stripping it down to the bare essentials. The various parts 
  of the city separated by the river could be treated as points (called <i>vertices</i> 
  in Graph Theory) and the paths between them across the bridges as line segments 
  or arcs (called <i>edges</i>).  Below is this stripped down version of the seven 
  bridges problem.</p>
<p> <span style='position:
absolute;z-index:1;width:149px;height:167px'><img
width=149 height=167 src="image002.gif" tppabs="http://165.29.91.7/asms_teaching_units/Teaching_Units/Mathematics/Graph_Theory_files/image002.gif" v:shapes="_x0000_s1027"></span> 
  &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using this stripped down version of the problem, Euler was able to give an 
  argument that showed that such a circuit did not exist; that is, he proved that 
  it was impossible to make such a walk.  This idea has been extended to arbitrary 
  graphs and a path starting at a certain vertex and passing along each edge (across 
  each bridge) exactly one time ending at the original vertex is called an <i>Euler 
  Circuit</i> in honor of the man himself.   </p>
<p> 1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> At this point students should try to find an Euler Circuit for the Konigsburg 
  bridges.  </p>
<p> 2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> After many attempts, ask students if they believe it is possible and 
  why or why not.  Inform the students that there is no Euler Circuit but before 
  you explain why have them try and find Euler Circuits for the graphs A, B, C, 
  and D below.</p>

  be possible at this point for some students to come up with a argument similar 
  to the one Euler gave.  Euler realized that unless one is at the starting vertex, 
  for any Euler Circuit, every time the path goes into a vertex it must also come 
  out or else one would be stuck at that vertex since you are not allowed to retrace 
  any edge.  Hence, except for the starting vertex, each vertex must have an even 
  number of edges attached to it (such a vertex is said to have <i>even degree</i>).   
  As for the starting vertex it must also have even degree since you start out 
  from there and every time you come back to it (if any) you will go out until 
  you finish there.  Heuristically then it appears that ALL vertices must have 
  even degree.   Since NONE of the vertices in the Konigsburg bridge graph have 
  even degree, there certainly cannot be an Euler Circuit.  In fact, Euler gave 
  a rigorous proof of the following theorem on the existence of an Euler Circuit.</p>
<p>Theorem:  A graph has an Euler Circuit if and only if it is connected and all 
  its vertices are of odd degree.  </p>
<p>Note: C<i>onnected </i>means that every vertex is joined to at least one other 
  vertex.  </p>
<p>3) Have students use the theorem to check their answers about the graphs A,B,C, 
  and D above that have Euler Circuits.</p>
<p>Again, a path that begins and ends at the same vertex is called a circuit and 
  if it covers each edge exactly once, it is called Eulerian or an Euler Circuit.  
  Then, a<b> </b>sleight variation on the problem is to allow the path to end 
  at a different vertex than the starting one, that is, the Euler Path does not 
  have to be a circuit but does have to cover every edge exactly once.  In this 
  case, the above theorem requires a slight change.</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>4) Ask students how this will change the Theorem.  </p>
<p>5) To evaluate if the students have grasped these ideas, have them determine 
  which of the graphs above have Euler Paths.  Having explored these ideas, they 
  should also be able to find Euler Paths for those graphs.</p>
