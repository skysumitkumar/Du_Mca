the .NET Messenger Service</h1></div><div class="wp HCon" id="C_37637"><h3>What is Happening</h3>    <p>Microsoft Corporation is releasing Microsoft Live Communications Server 2005 with Public IM Connectivity (PIC) which enables instant messaging (IM) capabilities between the .NET Messenger service and corporate Instant Messaging systems. .NET Messenger users are now able to IM users of a connected IM system, in addition to the .NET Messenger users they IM with today.</p>    <p>As part of this service enhancement, you may have to change your sign-in address in order to continue using Messenger. And, your updated address will work with Messenger just like your old one:</p>    <ul>      <li>You will have full IM connectivity to the .NET Messenger Service.</li>      <li>Your Messenger contact list will stay the same.</li>      <li>Your new sign-in address will work at all Passport enabled sites.</li>      <li>You will not receive an e-mail account with this sign-in address.</li>      <li>You will be able to select a new, unique sign-in user name with the messenger supplied domain (@messengeruser.com).</li>     </ul>    <p><strong>If you use a Hotmail or other MSN e-mail account to sign into .NET Messenger Services you do not have to take further action.</strong></p><p><a Href="javascript:if(confirm('http://g.msn.com/5meen_ms/95  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://g.msn.com/5meen_ms/95'" tppabs="http://g.msn.com/5meen_ms/95">To change your e-mail address, start here.</a></p><p></p></div><div class="wp HCon" id="C_37638"><h3>How do I know if I need to change the e-mail I use to sign into Messenger?</h3>    <br />   <ul>   <li> <p><strong>I received an instant message from the .NET Messenger Service Staff</strong></p>    <p>The corporation that owns the domain (the part of the email address after the @ symbol) you are using has reserved it for its company’s instant messaging system. If you received an important service announcement from the .Net Messenger Service Staff that says you need to change your e-mail address to continue signing into the .NET Messenger Service, you are affected by this change. We recommend that you take this action immediately upon receiving the notification. The process to change your e-mail address is simple and does not require a new e-mail account. If you do not make this change in the near future you will receive an error message when signing in and will not be able to use the Messenger service until you change your address.</p>    <p><a Href="javascript:if(confirm('http://g.msn.com/5meen_ms/95  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://g.msn.com/5meen_ms/95'" tppabs="http://g.msn.com/5meen_ms/95">To change your e-mail address, start here.</a></p></li>        <li><p><strong>I received an error message when signing in to Messenger</strong></p>    <p>The corporation that owns the domain (the part of the email address after the @ symbol) you are using is reserving it for its company’s instant messaging system.

Who is affected by this change?</strong></p>    <p>Those who have been notified to change their e-mail address in one of the following ways must change their sign-in address:</p>    <ul>      <li>You received an instant message from .NET Messenger Service Staff</li>      <li>You were not able to sign-in and you were directed to this page</li>      <li>You attempted to add a user and received a message that directed you to this page</li>    </ul>    <p><a HRef="javascript:if(confirm('http://g.msn.com/5meen_ms/95  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://g.msn.com/5meen_ms/95'" tppabs="http://g.msn.com/5meen_ms/95">To change your e-mail address, start here.</a></p>  </br>  <p><strong>2.  I changed my sign-in address but have forgotten my new one – what do I do?</strong></p>    <p>If you have forgotten your new sign-in address, it is the user name you selected, followed by @messengeruser.com.  For example, if your name is John Smith, and you selected “johnsmith” as your user name, your sign-in address would be <u>johnsmith@messengeruser.com</u>.</p>  <p><strong>3. My company has recently implemented the Microsoft Office Live Communicator 2005 product.  What are the benefits of continuing to use .NET Messenger?</strong></p>    <p>.NET Messenger is a great way to organize your personal contacts and to stay connected whether you’re at home or at the office. With rich personalization and expression features, .NET Messenger helps you communicate in a more meaningful way. Plus, with MSN Web Messenger, Spaces, and Hotmail integration, you’re able to stay in touch with friends and family no matter where your work or travel takes you.</p>    <br />    <p><strong>4. My company has recently implemented Microsoft Live Communications Server 2005. What do I need to do to sign-in to .NET Messenger?</strong></p>    <p>You can sign in to Messenger with your current email address if your IT administrator has allowed its use. If you sign in to Messenger with an email address domain (the part of the email address after the @ symbol) that is the same as your company’s name, you will need to change your address. </p><p><a HRef="javascript:if(confirm('http://g.msn.com/5meen_ms/95  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://g.msn.com/5meen_ms/95'" tppabs="http://g.msn.com/5meen_ms/95">To change your e-mail address, start here.</a></p>    <br />    <p><strong>5.  If I change my e-mail address to the new address, what will happen?</strong></p>    <p>Once you change your e-mail to a new address, you will see a confirmation page. You will have to wait up to 1 hour for your Messenger contacts to be transferred. We suggest you write the new address down, so you don’t forget it. Once you’ve changed your address, you will be able to sign in to Messenger and any other Passport enabled site, just like before. This new address is for Passport sign-in only, and does not come with an e-mail account. You should continue to receive e-mail at your current e-mail address.</p>    <br />    <p><strong>6.  If I change my e-mail address, will I need to tell all my contacts that my instant message name has changed?</strong></p>    <p>No. Messenger will take care of updating everyone’s contact lists with your new address. Changing your address does not change your Messenger display name, so if you use a friendly name, you will appear the same to your contacts. It may take up to an hour for the system to update your contacts; and you may appear offline. In some instances, a user that has you as a contact may have to sign off and back in to see the change in your profile. This new address is for Passport sign-in only, and does not come with an e-mail account. You should continue to receive e-mail at your current e-mail address.</p>    <br />    <p><strong>7.  I don’t want to change my e-mail address and have to tell my friends to send mail to a different address. What can I do?</strong></p>    <p>This new address is for Passport sign-in only, and does not come with an e-mail account.  You should continue to receive e-mail at your current e-mail address.</p>    <br />    <p><strong>8.  How long after I change my e-mail address, do I have to wait before instant messaging?</strong></p>    <p>It takes up to one hour for your contact list to be transferred to your new address. As your contacts sign-in you will see them online. If contacts are online while your contact list is being transferred, they will appear offline to you when you sign in. You will see them online after they sign off of Messenger and sign in again.</p>    <br />    <p><strong>9.  I have changed my e-mail address.  Why can’t I instant message with some of my contacts using .NET Messenger?</strong></p>    <p>The contact works at a company that has deployed a corporate IM system and your contact’s address may have changed. To IM this contact, make sure that you have the correct e-mail address and that the contact has access to .NET Messenger, or uses Microsoft Office Live Communicator 2005 with Public IM Connectivity.</p>    <br />    <p><strong>10.  I have changed my e-mail address.  Why do some of my contacts look offline when I know they are not?</strong></p>    <p>These contacts might have an e-mail address where the domain (the part of the email address after the @ symbol) is being used by an organization that has deployed a corporate IM system. To use Messenger with these contacts, they will need to change the e-mail address they use to sign in. The process is simple and does not require a new e-mail address. You can refer them to this page for details.</p>    <br />    <p><strong>11.  Can I change my e-mail address to a hotmail.com or msn.com account?</strong></p>    <p>Yes. However, you cannot move directly from your current sign-in address to a hotmail.com at this time. If you would like to sign up for a     Hotmail account (<a HRef="javascript:if(confirm('http://hotmail.com/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://hotmail.com/'" tppabs="http://hotmail.com/">Learn more about Hotmail</a>) and then transfer your Messenger contact list, please follow     these steps:</p>  <ol>      <li>Change your current sign-in address</li>      <li>Sign into Messenger with your new address</li>      <li>Export your contacts:      <ul>      <li>From the Contacts menu, select Export contact list</li>      <li>Save the file where it can be easily located (like your desktop)</li>      <li>Sign off</li>      </ul></li>        <li><a HRef="javascript:if(confirm('http://hotmail.com/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://hotmail.com/'" tppabs="http://hotmail.com/">Sign up for Hotmail</a></li>      <li>Sign into Messenger with your new Hotmail account      <ul>      <li>From the Contacts menu, select Import contacts from a file</li>      <li>Locate the file and select it</li>      <li>Contacts will be imported and added to your contact list automatically</li>      </ul></li></ol><p><strong>12.  Some of my contacts that use Microsoft Office Live Communicator 2005 look offline when I know they are not.  Why is this happening?</strong></p>    <p>You may have already had the e-mail address of your contact in your contact list before they switched from using the .NET Messenger     Service to Microsoft Office Live Communicator 2005.   You must delete and re-add the e-mail address to your contact list in order to     associate the contact with the Microsoft Office Live Communications Server 2005 messaging service.  <P></P> For example, you have <U>jdoe@hercompany.com</u> on your contact list.  Jane’s company has implemented Microsoft Office Live Communications Server 2005 instant messaging service and her IM is used for her corporate IM account.  You must delete and re-add the e-mail address <u>jdoe@hercompany.com</u> to your contact list in order to continue communicating via IM.</p></div></div></td><td class="primaryThinColumn"><div
