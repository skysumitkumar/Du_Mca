		  technology that is designed to help verify that the product is
		  valid.<br><br><span class="weboutput">
<A CLASS="LINK" HREF="#1">General Questions</A>
					</span><br><br><span><a id="1b"></a></span><b>Which Microsoft products include MPA?</b><br><br> MPA is included in several versions of Microsoft
		  products, including Microsoft Office XP (and single programs such as Word
		  2002), Windows XP, Microsoft Visio 2002, Microsoft FrontPage 2002, and
		  Microsoft Project 2002. Product activation is required in retail packaged
		  products and in new computers that have been purchased from a computer
		  manufacturer. Product activation is not required for licenses that customers
		  acquire through one of the Microsoft volume licensing programs, such as Open
		  License or Select License. <br><br><span class="weboutput">
<A CLASS="LINK" HREF="#1">General Questions</A>
					</span><br><br><span><a id="1c"></a></span><b>Which customers have to activate?</b><br><br> All customers who purchase retail packaged products or
		  a new computer from an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) have to activate
		  the product. The products on a new computer that was purchased from an OEM may
		  be activated in the factory. Product activation is not required for licenses
		  that customers acquire through one of the Microsoft Volume Licensing programs,
		  such as Open License or Select License. Volume Licensing programs can be scaled
		  to even the smallest businesses, and customers can qualify for the Microsoft
		  Open License program by acquiring as few as five product licenses. For more
		  information, visit the following Microsoft Web site: <div class="indent"><span><a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.microsoft.com/licensing/default.asp  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.microsoft.com/licensing/default.asp'" tppabs="http://www.microsoft.com/licensing/default.asp">Microsoft Licensing</a></span></div><span class="weboutput">
<A CLASS="LINK" HREF="#1">General Questions</A>
					</span><br><br><span><a id="1d"></a></span><b>How does MPA work?</b><br><br> MPA validates that the product's Product Key, which is
		  required as part of product installation, has not been used on more computers
		  than the product's end-user license agreement (EULA) allows. Generally, Windows
		  XP can be installed on one computer, and Office XP can be installed on one
		  computer and that computer user's portable computer. For more information, see
		  the EULA for your product. <br><br> The Product Key information, which the
		  Product ID contains, is sent with a "hardware hash" (a number that the
		  computer's hardware configuration generates) to the Microsoft activation system
		  during activation. In Windows XP SP1, the Product Key is also sent. Activation
		  is completed either directly by using the Internet or by making a telephone
		  call to a customer service representative. If you install Windows XP on the
		  same computer by using the same Product Key, the number of activations is not
		  limited. MPA discourages piracy by limiting the number of times that a Product
		  Key can be activated on different computers. <br><br><span class="weboutput">
<A CLASS="LINK" HREF="#1">General Questions</A>
					</span><br><br><span><a id="1e"></a></span><b>Can a product (for example, Windows XP or Office XP) be turned off remotely by using MPA?</b><br><br> No, the product cannot be turned off remotely by using
		  MPA. <br><br><span class="weboutput">
<A CLASS="LINK" HREF="#1">General Questions</A>
					</span><br><br><span><a id="1f"></a></span><b>Why does Microsoft require customers to activate their products?</b><br><br> MPA was designed as a simple way to verify the product
		  license and to help reduce the spread of software piracy. People who use
		  pirated software contribute to a problem that can adversely affect job creation
		  locally and regionally in the software industry and related businesses.
		  Software piracy is an enormous drain on the global economy, according to the
		  2000 BSA Software Piracy Report. The report estimates that worldwide losses
		  from software piracy in 2000 were almost $12 billion. Software piracy also has
		  a significant effect on the high-tech industry, and the results are lost jobs,
		  reduced innovation, and increased costs to consumers. <br><br><span class="weboutput">
<A CLASS="LINK" HREF="#1">General Questions</A>
					</span><br><br><span><a id="1g"></a></span><b>How does MPA help reduce piracy?</b><br><br> MPA helps reduce casual copying by making sure that the
		  copy of the product that is being installed is valid and that it has been
		  installed on the computer in accordance with the product's EULA. Installations
		  that are not compliant with the EULA are not activated. <br><br><span class="weboutput">
<A CLASS="LINK" HREF="#1">General Questions</A>
					</span><br><br><span><a id="1h"></a></span><b>Have companies tried to implement anti-piracy technologies?</b><br><br> Anti-piracy technologies have been used in the past,
		  but they have not been easy for customers to use. These technologies were
		  generally not acceptable to customers or to the industry. For example, some
		  early computer products required specialized hardware components or disks that
		  were cumbersome for the user. MPA is a breakthrough technology because it makes
		  activation a part of installing the product and helps avoid the problems of
		  previous anti-piracy methods.<br><br><span class="weboutput">
<A CLASS="LINK" HREF="#1">General Questions</A>
					</span><br><br><span><a id="1i"></a></span><b>How does the customer benefit from this approach?</b><br><br> Over time, the result of reduced piracy is that the
		  software industry can invest more in product development, quality, and support.
		  This leads to better products and more innovation for customers. Ultimately,
		  customers benefit from the economic effect of reduced piracy through more jobs
		  and increased wages. Customers also receive the added value for their software
		  investment by receiving product updates and other product information. MPA also
		  helps prevent unsuspecting customers from purchasing counterfeit products.
		  Customers who purchase counterfeit products may find that they are missing key
		  elements, such as user manuals, Product Keys, certificates of authenticity, and
		  even software code. They may also find that the counterfeit product contains
		  viruses or does not work well.<br><br><span class="weboutput">
<A CLASS="LINK" HREF="#1">General Questions</A>
					</span><br><br><span><a id="1j"></a></span><b>Where has MPA been tested?</b><br><br> MPA was tested with Microsoft Office 2000 when it was
		  released in 1999 in six countries: Australia, Brazil, Canada, China (including
		  Hong Kong SAR), New Zealand, and the United States. This test resulted in over
		  7 million successful activation transactions. Microsoft received significant
		  feedback from customers who have used product activation. Microsoft has
		  incorporated the feedback in the latest version of MPA that is being used with
		  Windows XP, Office XP and Visio 2002. <br><br><span class="weboutput">
<A CLASS="LINK" HREF="#1">General Questions</A>
					</span><br><br><span><a id="1k"></a></span><b>What were some of the key lessons that Microsoft learned by testing MPA with Office 2000?</b><br><br> Customers generally found activation to be easy.
		  Telephone calls averaged two to three minutes in length, with hold times of two
		  to three minutes or less. On average, over 70 percent of the activation
		  requests were conducted over the Internet, and approximately 2 percent of the
		  activation requests occurred because of hardware changes or
		  reactivations.<br><br><span class="weboutput">

		  valid product licenses. Customers have the choice of activating over the
		  Internet or by using the telephone. Customers can also delay activation for
		  several uses of the product until a time that is convenient for them to
		  activate the product. Customers who obtain product copies that are not valid
		  will find that MPA makes their use of that product more difficult. Millions of
		  customers have used MPA to date with little or no difficulty. <br><br><span class="weboutput">
<A CLASS="LINK" HREF="#2">How MPA Works</A>
					</span><br><br><span><a id="2b"></a></span><b>Are customers notified that they have to activate?</b><br><br> Yes. Customers are notified of the activation
		  requirement on the box if they purchase a retail version of the product.
		  Additionally, for programs such as Word, customers are reminded to activate
		  every time that they use the program, up until the fiftieth use, which is the
		  maximum number of times that they can use the program before they have to
		  activate. For Windows, customers are reminded every time that they log on and
		  regularly up until the end of the activation grace period, which is 30 days. If
		  they have not activated the product in the specified time frame, they have to
		  do this to continue using the product.<br><br><span class="weboutput">
<A CLASS="LINK" HREF="#2">How MPA Works</A>
					</span><br><br><span><a id="2c"></a></span><b>Is there a grace period during which the product works without being activated?</b><br><br> Yes. Users can use a product for a while without
		  activating it. For the Office XP family of products, the grace period is the
		  first 50 uses. For Visio 2002, the grace period is 10 uses. For Windows, it is
		  30 days from the first installation or upgrade.<br><br><span class="weboutput">
<A CLASS="LINK" HREF="#2">How MPA Works</A>
					</span><br><br><span><a id="2d"></a></span><b>What is "reduced functionality mode" in Office XP and Office XP family products?</b><br><br> Programs go into reduced functionality mode if the user
		  does not activate before the end of the grace period, which is the fiftieth use
		  for Office XP and its family products and the tenth use for Visio 2002. In this
		  mode, users cannot save changes to documents or create new documents, and
		  additional functionality may be reduced. Existing files are not affected and
		  can be edited or saved with an activated installation of Office XP or Visio
		  2002. Users can regain full functionality of the product by
		  activating.<br><br><span class="weboutput">

<A CLASS="LINK" HREF="#2">How MPA Works</A>
					</span><br><br><span><a id="2f"></a></span><b>How does MPA connect over the Internet?</b><br><br> For Office XP family products, activation over the
		  Internet requires users to have their own Internet service provider (ISP)
		  connection. Users who do not have an ISP connection have to activate by
		  telephoning a customer service representative. For Windows XP, users who do not
		  have an ISP may use the Microsoft ISP network to activate. Users who do not
		  have an ISP and cannot use the Microsoft ISP network have to activate by
		  telephoning a customer service representative.<br><br><span class="weboutput">

					</span><br><br><span><a id="2h"></a></span><b>If I am outside the United States, how do I activate my installation by using the telephone?</b><br><br> Microsoft has regional and, in some locations, local
		  customer service centers to process activation requests. Telephone access
		  numbers to these customer service centers are toll-free where available. Some
		  countries can only be serviced with local toll numbers because of their
		  telephony infrastructure or other issues. For very few countries, users have to

					</span><br><br><span><a id="2i"></a></span><b>Why are the Installation and Confirmation IDs so long when I activate by telephoning a customer service representative?</b><br><br> Microsoft did usability testing of both numeric and
		  alphanumeric Installation and Confirmation IDs. Although the IDs might have
		  been made shorter by using alphabetical characters, Microsoft learned through
		  usability testing that users' interactions with the customer service
		  representatives were substantially more error-free when the IDs were all
		  numeric. There were fewer misunderstandings with numerals than with
		  alphabetical characters. Because the conversations were more error-free, the
		  calls were shorter and customer satisfaction with the telephone activation
		  process was improved. Additionally, all languages use numerals, whereas not all
		  languages use Latin-based script characters.<br><br><span class="weboutput">

		  MPA. MPA is anonymous, and no personally identifiable information is collected.
		  Activation is different from product registration. Customers can voluntarily
		  register their products by providing their names and contact information.
		  Registration is for those customers who want to receive future communications
		  on product updates, service releases, and other special offers. Any information
		  that is provided to Microsoft is treated securely, is kept private, and is used
		  only for the purposes that are specified by the customer. The hardware hash
		  that is used during activation is a combination of the hash values of various
		  computer components and cannot be used to determine the make or model of the
		  computer. It also cannot be backward-calculated to determine the raw computer
		  information.<br><br><span class="weboutput">
<A CLASS="LINK" HREF="#3">Privacy</A>
					</span><br><br><span><a id="3b"></a></span><b>Is there rechecking of the activation after initial activation? Is there any secret data transfer to Microsoft?</b><br><br> The product does check itself occasionally to see if it
		  is activated and if it is still installed on the same computer that it was
		  originally activated on. At no time is information transferred to Microsoft
		  because of MPA, except while the user is actually in the process of activating

		  will
		  then store the users'

		  have not changed. Microsoft EULAs have always specified the number of computers
		  where the product can be installed. MPA does not change that. For Office XP,
		  primary users can also install one copy of the product on a portable computer
		  for their exclusive use. To install Office XP on more than these two devices,
		  the user must acquire another license of the product. Licenses for copies of
		  Office XP that are preinstalled on new computers are single-computer licenses
		  that cannot be transferred or installed again on another computer. The
		  licensing terms have not been changed because of MPA. <br><br><span class="weboutput">
<A CLASS="LINK" HREF="#4">Activation and Product Licensing Policies</A>
					</span><br><br><span><a id="4b"></a></span><b>Does MPA allow customers to install products on a portable computer and on a desktop computer?</b><br><br> Consumers may use the terms of the product's EULA to
		  determine if this is allowed. Sometimes, the Microsoft EULA permits customers
		  who are the primary users of Microsoft programs, such as Office and Word, to
		  install one additional copy on their portable computers for their exclusive
		  use. This does not apply to product licenses that are acquired with the
		  purchase of a computer. These OEM licenses are single-use licenses that cannot
		  be transferred to another computer. Windows XP can only be installed on a
		  single computer. A new license is required if you install and activate the
		  product on a different computer.<br><br><span class="weboutput">
<A CLASS="LINK" HREF="#4">Activation and Product Licensing Policies</A>
					</span><br><br><span><a id="4c"></a></span><b>If I have to reinstall the product, do I have to purchase a new license?</b><br><br> Generally, if the same version of the product is
		  reinstalled on the same computer and it has not been installed on any other
		  computer, no new license is required. Additional licenses are generally
		  required for installations that are not permitted by the product's EULA.

<A CLASS="LINK" HREF="#4">Activation and Product Licensing Policies</A>
					</span><br><br><span><a id="4d"></a></span><b>If I have to reinstall the product, is reactivation required?</b><br><br> Reactivation is not always required when you reinstall
		  the product. If the same version of the product is reinstalled on the same
		  computer and the hard disk is not reformatted before the product is
		  reinstalled, the product remains activated. Reactivation is required if the
		  hard disk is reformatted and then the product is reinstalled. Reactivation is
		  required because the product's activation status is stored on the hard disk and
		  reformatting the hard disk removes that status.<br><br><span class="weboutput">
<A CLASS="LINK" HREF="#4">Activation and Product Licensing Policies</A>
					</span><br><br><span><a id="4e"></a></span><b>What happens if you try to install and activate a product on more computers than the EULA allows?</b><br><br> Installation of the product on more computers than the
		  EULA allows is a violation of the EULA. Technically, MPA does not limit the
		  number of computers where the product can be installed. For example, you could
		  install Windows XP on 100 computers, but activation would not be successful on
		  99 of those computers. If you installed Office XP on 100 computers, activation
		  would not be successful on 98 of those computers. This limits the usefulness of
		  the installations that are in violation of the EULA. Outside MPA, Microsoft
		  does not know how many computers have Windows XP or Office XP family products
		  installed. <br><br><span class="weboutput">
<A CLASS="LINK" HREF="#4">Activation and Product Licensing Policies</A>
					</span><br><br><span><a id="4f"></a></span><b>Can I transfer a license to another computer?</b><br><br> Consumers may use the terms of their license agreements
		  to determine if transferring a license to another computer is allowed. If a
		  transfer is permitted by the license agreement, the product has to be removed
		  from the computer where it was first installed. Users may have to complete the
		  activation on the new computer by phoning the Microsoft Activation
		  Center.<br><br><span class="weboutput">

					</span><br><br><span><a id="4g"></a></span><b>I do not want to activate. What can I do to turn this off?</b><br><br>Activation is required for continued use of the product.
		  Businesses and other customers who have to acquire multiple licenses for an
		  organization must contact their software reseller about their eligibility to
		  purchase licenses through one of the Microsoft Volume Licensing

					</span><br><br><span><a id="4h"></a></span><b>Does Microsoft use activation to require me to upgrade? Will Microsoft ever stop issuing activation codes for one or more of the products that require activation?</b><br><br> No. Microsoft does not use activation as a tool to
		  require people to upgrade. Activation is only an anti-piracy tool.<br><br>
		  Microsoft will also support the activation of Windows XP and will likely
		  provide an update that turns off activation at the end of the product's life

		  an Installation ID. For Office XP and Office XP family products, such as Visio
		  2002, the name of the country where the product is being installed is also
		  required. The Installation ID facilitates activation. It has two components:
		  the Product ID, which is generated by using the Product Key, and a hardware
		  hash value, which is generated by using your hardware configuration
		  information. For Windows XP SP1 and later, a third component, the Product Key,
		  is also used. <br><br> MPA uses a hash algorithm to generate the hardware
		  identifier but does not scan the customer's hard disk, detect any personal
		  information, or determine the make, model, or manufacturer of the computer or
		  of its components. For example, if the computer's color is used as part of the
		  Installation ID, the hardware hash would be the high four bits of the color.
		  That color would always produce the same high four bits, but those four high
		  bits cannot be used to determine the color. For users who activate over the
		  Internet, the Installation ID is sent electronically. For users who activate by
		  telephone, the Installation ID is converted to decimal format (versus digital
		  format) and is displayed in the product's user interface (UI). The user who
		  activates by using the telephone has to read the Installation ID to the
		  customer service representative.<br><br><span class="weboutput">
<A CLASS="LINK" HREF="#5">Technical Activation Details</A>
					</span><br><br><span><a id="5b"></a></span><b>What is an Installation ID?</b><br><br> The Installation ID is the data that is used to
		  activate a product. The Installation ID is a code that you provide to Microsoft
		  as part of activation, either electronically, if activation occurs over the
		  Internet, or by reading it to a customer service representative, if activation
		  occurs over the telephone. The Installation ID has two components: the Product
		  ID and a hardware hash value. For Windows XP SP1 installations, the Product Key
		  is also used. <br><br> The Product ID is unique to that installation, and it
		  is generated from the Product Key that is used during installation. The
		  hardware hash value is a representation of the computer where the product is
		  installed. It is named a hardware hash value because it has no direct
		  correlation to the computer and cannot be backward-calculated to the original
		  value. If the Installation ID is used for a telephone activation, it is a
		  50-digit code (54 digits for Windows XP SP1 activations) that has to be read to
		  the customer service representative.<br><br><span class="weboutput">
<A CLASS="LINK" HREF="#5">Technical Activation Details</A>
					</span><br><br><span><a id="5c"></a></span><b>Do Installation IDs differ for different computers?</b><br><br> Yes. The Installation IDs are different if they are
		  generated by different computers.<br><br><span class="weboutput">
<A CLASS="LINK" HREF="#5">Technical Activation Details</A>
					</span><br><br><span><a id="5d"></a></span><b>How does MPA identify the computer's hardware?</b><br><br> MPA detects the hardware configuration for the computer
		  where the product is being installed, and then MPA creates a hardware hash
		  value for that configuration. A hash is a value that is mathematically derived
		  from another value. In this case, the hash is derived from the hardware
		  configuration values. MPA does not scan the customer's hard disk, detect any
		  personal information, or determine the make, model, or manufacturer of the
		  computer or of its components. MPA uses hash values because of respect for
		  users' privacy. A hash value cannot be backward-calculated to determine the
		  original value. Additionally, Microsoft only uses a part of the original hash
		  values. These hash values are combined to form the hardware
		  hash.<br><br><span class="weboutput">
<A CLASS="LINK" HREF="#5">Technical Activation Details</A>
					</span><br><br><span><a id="5e"></a></span><b>Can I change or upgrade my hardware components?</b><br><br> MPA can tolerate some change in hardware components by
		  allowing a degree of difference between the current hash value and the hash
		  value that was originally activated. Users can change hardware components
		  without having to reactivate the product. If users make substantial changes to
		  their hardware components, even over long periods of time, they may have to
		  reactivate the product. In that case, users may have to contact a Microsoft
		  customer service representative by telephone to reactivate.<br><br><span class="weboutput">
<A CLASS="LINK" HREF="#5">Technical Activation Details</A>
					</span><br><br><span><a id="5f"></a></span><b>How does MPA determine tolerance? How many components of the computer can I change before I have to reactivate?</b><br><br> Common changes to hardware, such as upgrading a video
		  card, adding a second hard disk, adding RAM, or upgrading a CD-ROM or DVD-ROM
		  drive, do not require reactivation.<br><br> Specifically, MPA determines
		  tolerance by using a point system. Ten hardware characteristics are used to
		  create the hardware hash. Each characteristic is equal to one point, except the
		  network card, which is equal to three points. Tolerance is determined by what
		  has not changed, instead of what has changed. If the current hardware hash is
		  compared to the original hardware hash, there have to be seven or more matching
		  points for the two hardware hashes to be considered in tolerance. For example,
		  if the network card, which is equal to three points, remains the same, only
		  four additional points have to match. If the network card has been changed, a
		  total of seven points have to match. If the device is a portable computer
		  (specifically a dockable device), additional tolerance is allotted and only
		  four matching points are required. Therefore, if the device is dockable and the
		  network card has not changed, only one additional point has to be the same, for
		  a total of four points. If the device is dockable and the network card has
		  changed, a total of four points have to match. <br><br><span class="weboutput">

					</span><br><br><span><a id="5l"></a></span><b>Does MPA really help reduce piracy?</b><br><br> MPA is not the end of global piracy. However, MPA is
		  significantly more sophisticated than past methods and is not easy for would-be
		  pirates to circumvent. At the same time, it is an easy process for customers
		  who have valid software. It helps deter casual copying of software, which is by
		  far the single most prevalent type of software piracy. It also helps deter some
		  hard disk cloning and counterfeiting. It is not designed to target
		  sophisticated and organized criminal counterfeiters.<br><br><span class="weboutput">

					</span><br><br><span><a id="5m"></a></span><b>Product activation has been cracked before and it will be cracked again. What's the use?</b><br><br> Product activation is significantly harder to crack
		  than most people think. The measure of success is not completely stopping
		  software piracy. Completely stopping piracy is not an attainable goal. Success
		  is better measured as increased awareness of the terms of the license agreement
		  and increased license compliance.<br><br><span class="weboutput">

		  customers can now encrypt their Volume License Keys (VLKs) during unattended
		  installations. <br><br> Licensed customers are not affected by these changes.

		  you install Windows XP SP1, it will still have to be activated after you
		  install Windows XP SP1. If you activate Windows XP after you install Windows XP

		  Nothing happens to your underlying installation of Windows XP. Microsoft offers

					</span><br><br><span><a id="6g"></a></span><b>Does Microsoft Windows Update verify that the Product Key is valid? How does MPA use the Product Key after I install Windows XP SP1?</b><br><br> Yes. Windows Update verifies the Product Key and

		  and Product ID are verified, they are discarded; neither the Product Key nor
		  the Product ID is stored after the validation check. <br><br> For activation
		  after you have installed Windows XP SP1, Microsoft uses the Product Key as part
		  of the Installation ID to determine if it is valid. If it is not valid, the
		  activation request is denied. In the Product Key is not valid, the Product Key
		  and the Installation ID are kept as part of the error record. Remember that no

		  provide a time period for customers to activate if they make a hardware change.
		  Previously, a significant hardware change would require an immediate
		  reactivation. With Windows XP SP1, a significant hardware change requires
		  reactivation in three days.<br><br><span class="weboutput">
