<font color="blue">Question:</font><br>
Napoleon and Josephine are lying dead on the floor in a pool of water. The only other thing
                           noticeable in the room is that the French doors are wide open and the curtains are flapping.
                           How did they die?

Napoleon and Josephine are goldfish. There was a storm that blew their fishbowl over.
