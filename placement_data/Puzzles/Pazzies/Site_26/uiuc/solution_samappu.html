<font color="blue">Question:</font><br>
Sam and Appu are the greatest mathematicians ever born. Both of them have two prime numbers on their foreheads
                         and are told that any three of them form the sides of a triangle with prime perimeter. They take turns stating whether
                         they can deduce the numbers on their own foreheads. Sam sees 13 and 17 on Appu's forehead and each of them has
                         stated "Don't know" on each of their first two turns. It is now Sam's third turn. What are the numbers on Sam's
                         forehead? 

<p>
<font color="blue">Answer:</font><br>
The answer is 13 and 17.

The logic is as follows:
Corresponding to 13 and 17 (pair on Appu's head)there are
just 3 combinations which satisfy prime perimeter triangle
condition:
<p>
a) 7,17<br>
b) 11,13<br>
c) 13,17<br>
<p>

If Sam had 7 and 17, Appu would have guessed
13 and 17 in his first guess as that is the only possible
solution.
<p>

If Sam had 11 and 13, Appu had one of the 2 choices to make
a)5,13 b)13,17 but Appu being an intelligent mathematician would
never had chosen 5,13 coz if that was the case, his counterpart
would have guessed 11 and 13 in his first guess. But since
Sam passed on his first attempt, Apu knows it cannot be 5 and 13
Incidentally Appu is not able to guess it in the second turn also
so even 11, 13 as an option is ruled out.
<p>
The last option is 13 and 17 which like before has 3 possibilities.
Since both pass first two times only that option remains and Sam
guesses it right in his third attempt.
