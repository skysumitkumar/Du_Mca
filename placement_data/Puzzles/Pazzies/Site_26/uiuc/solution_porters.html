<font color="blue">Question:</font><br>
An explorer named Marco wants to cross an Australian desert on foot. The
track will begin in the outback at the aboriginal village of Kwazi and
takes six days. However, one man can only take enough food to last him
four days. Fortunately, Marco can hire porters from Kwazi to assist him.
Each porter costs $100 per day that he is away from the village. What is
the least possible cost to Marco of hiring enough porters so that he can
cross the desert and the porters can return home safely? Explain your
answer.
<p>
<font color="blue">Answer:</font><br>
$600<p>

Day 0: Marco leaves with 2 porters<br>
Day 1: Porter 1 goes back home  and gives Porter 2 and Marco 1 pack each<br>
Day 2: Porter 2 goes back home and gives Marco 1 pack<br>
Day 3: Marco has 4 packs, and 4 days to go!
