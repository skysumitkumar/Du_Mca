<font color="blue">Question:</font><br>
What is the probability that at least two people in the world have the same number of friends?
                Assume that friendship is mutual. Explain your answer.

<font color="blue">Answer:</font><br>
The probability is 1.<p>
Thanks to <font color="blue">John Tripp</font> for this explanation!<p>
Let us assume that is possible for everyone in the world to have a
different number of friends.
<p>

W = World Population.
<p>

Since the maximum number of friendships for anyone is W-1,
We can enumerate the population F = 0 to W-1, where F will equal the number
of friendships Individual member of the population has.
<p>

So for individual 1, n=0  No Friendships
<p>

Now the individual with no friendships by definition can not have any
friends.  But individual W will need w-1 friends.  But the available
population is only w-2, after removing individual 1(0 Friends) and of
course individaul W.  So assumption can not be true.  Individual W MUST
have the same number of friends as someone else.
<p>

Of course, the situation becomes critical much sooner that at individual W.
 But this is sufficient to prove probability of 1.
