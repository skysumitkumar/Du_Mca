  <li> <b> Triangles</b> <i><font color="green">(Intermediate)</font></i><p>
Using six matchsticks of equal length, construct at least 4
equilateral triangles in two dimensions.
Note - you cannot break the matchsticks! Also, you can assume that the
matchsticks are thin enough, so that if they overlap, they are still
in "two dimensions". Solutions with more than 4 triangles will be given
extra credit!

  <li><b>Birthday Candles</b> <i><font color="green">(Expert)</font></i><p>
  Your daughter just turned 10, and she wants her 10 candles arranged in her
  birthday cake in 5 rows of 4 each. She won't have it any other way! Is this possible? If so, how? (Some people suggested breaking the candles in half. This is not allowed!)

  <li><b>To Switch or Not to Switch...</b> <i><font color="green">(Master)</font></i><p>
I have three envelopes. Two of them are empty and one of them has a $100
                  bill. These are pretty good envelopes and you can't cheat by seeing
                  through them. :) You then pick one envelope. I peek into the other two
                  envelopes. Obviously at least one of these envelopes in empty.
 I throw
                  away one of these empty envelopes (if only one was empty, I throw that one
                  away, if both are empty I pick one at random and then throw it
 away). Now
                  I ask you to rethink your choice, giving you the option to choose the
                  other envelope instead. Should you stick to your choice, or should you
                  switch your choice to the other envelope? Or does it not make
any
                  difference? Remember, you really want the $100 bill, so you are trying to
                  maximize your chances!

<li><b>Beatles On a Bridge</b> <i><font color="green">(Intermediate)</font></i><p>
The Beatles have to be at a concert across the river in 17 minutes. The
problem is that the bridge across the river is very weak and is strong
enough to hold only two people at a time (only two people can cross at a
time). They have only one flashlight and anybody crossing the river must
have the flashlight at all times. John can cross the bridge in 1 minute,
Paul needs 2 minutes, George needs 5 minutes and Ringo needs 10. can they
make it to the concert in time? If so, how?
<p>
(This was apparently a Microsoft interview question.)

  <li><b>Heaven's Gate</b> <i><font color="green">(Intermediate)</font></i><p>
 You die and find yourself confronted by two guards at the gates of heaven and hell. You know that one of the guards always tells the truth, and the other always lies. You don't know which is which, and by asking one, and only one, question you need to figure out which one is the gate to Heaven (or hell, if you're adventurous). What will you ask? (Note: You can't combine two questions by using an
'and'...of course)

  <li><a name="100switches"><b>One Hundred Switches</b></a> <i><font color="green">(Master)</font></i><p>
 There are 100 switches numbered 1 to 100.
There are 100 people numbered 1 to 100
   Person x comes and toggles all switches that are multiples of x
   i.e., person 1 toggles 1,2,3,..., then 2 toggles 2,4,6,..., then 3 toggles 3,
6,9,..., etc. and at the end,
   person 100 toggles the 100th switch
   All switches are initially off. How many switches are ON at the end?

  <li> <a name="fly"><b>The Fly</b></a> <i><font color="green">(Expert)</font></i><p>
There are two cars facing each other and are 10 miles apart (bumper to bumper). There is a fly sitting on one of the car's bumpers. The two cars start moving towards each other at 5 miles/hour. The fly simultaneously starts flying (with an average speed of 15 miles/hour) towards the other car's bumper. When it reaches the other car's bumper, it instantaneously changes direction and starts flying towards the other car's bumper. The fly repeats this and keeps flying from bumper to bumper until the two cars collide, and the fly meets an untimely death. Calculate the total distance that the fly flies.

  <li> <b>Spurious Tablets</b> <i><font color="green">(Expert)</font></i><p>
In a chemical plant, there are 10 machines that produce tablets. All but 1 machine (the defective one!) produce 10 gram tablets. The defective machine produces 9 gram tablets. You are allowed to take as many tablets from all or any of the machines once and only once. You are allowed only one weighing on an electronic weighing scale (i.e., it will tell you the exact weight in grams). After this weighing you should be able to point out the defective machine. How would you do it? (Note: you have no estimation skills and simply rely on the weighing machine)
