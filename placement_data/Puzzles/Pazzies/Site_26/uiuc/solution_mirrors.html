You are inside a perfectly cubical room where each wall, the ceiling and the flo or are mirrors. There is nothing else in the room. Assuming that you can still breathe, how many reflections can you see if you're facing one direction, and can look up, down, left and right?

<font color="blue">Answer:</font><br>
0 reflections. There is no light source in the room!
