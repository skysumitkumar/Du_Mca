<font color="blue">Question:</font><br>
Imagine that there is a highway along the equator of the Earth. Two identical cars (with identical drivers) set off
                      in opposite directions on this highway - one eastwards, and the other, westwards. Which car will wear its tires
                      off first? Why? 
<p>

                      Note: The cars move in identical patterns. For simplicity you can assume that they both travel at the same
                      constant speed.

The car traveling westwards will wear its tires off first. 
<p>
This puzzle deals with physics. For an object that travels uniformly in a circular manner (uniform circular motion), it will experience a centrifugal force radially outwards. This force increases with the speed of the circular motion.<p>
Hence the faster a body travels, the lesser it will weight (weight = gravitational contribution - centrifugal contribution). <p>
The earth rotates from west to east. Hence the car moving eastwards, will be moving faster (relative motion around the center of the earth) than the car westwards. This will make the car traveling eastwards lighter, and the car traveling westwards heavier. Since friction is proportional to the normal reaction (weight), the car traveling westwards will wear its tires off first.
