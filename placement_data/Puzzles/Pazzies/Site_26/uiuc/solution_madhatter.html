<font color="blue">Question:</font><br>

The March Hare and the Mad Hatter were sipping their eggnog
     and watching the crowd when Alice happened to glance in the
     Hare's direction and ask, "Why are you giving me such an
     angry look?"
<br>
     "I'm not *giving* it to you, I'm giving it *back*," replied
     the Hare.
<br>
     "I didn't look crossly at you."
<br>
     "Well, *somebody* did," the Hare said, turning to glare at
     the Hatter.
<br>
     Just then, someone came up from behind and put his hands
     over the Hatter's eyes.
<br>
     "Guess who!" said the newcomer in a thin, flat voice.
<br>
     The Hatter froze for a moment and declared, rather coldly,
     "I have no use for practical jokers."
<br>
     "Ha! Neither have I," retorted the stranger, still keeping
     his hands over the Hatter's eyes.
<br>
     At that, the Hatter seemed to accept the challenge of the
     game and started asking a series of questions in a manner
     that mingled hope with care.
<p>
     Question: "Ahem. Would you, by chance, be in a black suit
     this evening?"<br>
     Answer: "I would, but not by chance, by design."
<p>
     Q: "I presume you're a member of all the posh clubs?"<br>
     A: "Afraid not. Never even been invited."
<p>
     Q: "Surely you're better than average?" <br>
     A: "Yes, indeed!"
<p>
     Q: "Not spotted, I hope?"<br>
     A: "Knock wood."
<p>
     Q: "Married?"<br>
     A: "No, happy."
<p>
     Who is behind the Mad Hatter?
<br>


<p>
<font color="blue">Answer:</font><br>
The Jack of Spades
<p>
This puzzle was devised by John F Collins and appeared in the August 1968
issue of "Word Ways"
<p>
The mystery guest was speaking in a "thin flat" voice, implying one member
of the playing cards. The joker is eliminated by using the statements
about not being a "practical joker". Since he's wearing a black suit, and
not a member of the clubs, he must be a member of spades. He isn't married,
so that rules out the King and the Queen. The Jack is better than average
and the only one who is not spotted. The mystery guest was the Jack of
Spades.
