<font color="blue">Question:</font><br>
Four cannibalistic spiders are placed one in each corner of a square room. The length of each side is 10
                      feet. They are released simultaneously and each spider starts moving directly towards the neighbour on its
                      right at the same constant speed. How far will each spider move before they all meet in the middle of the
                      room? Explain your answer.

10 feet <p>
Thanks to <font color="blue">Michael Wais</font> for the explanation!<p>
Since each spider is heading towards the one on its right, they will all be
traveling perpendicular to each other.  As they spiral in towards the center,
each spider adjusts its angle to remain headed directly toward the next -
hence always traveling at a 90 degree angle from each other.  So while each spider
is always moving, the movement of any one spider does not increase it's
distance from its pursuer.  As a result, the total distance traveled for
each will be 10 feet - the original distance.
