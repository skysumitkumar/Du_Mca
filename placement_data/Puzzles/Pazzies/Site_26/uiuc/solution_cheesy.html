<font color="blue">Question:</font><br>
A cube of cheese is divided into 27 sub-cubes. A mouse starts at one
        corner and eats each sub-cube, one at a time. Can it finish in the center
        of the cube? Note that the mouse can only go from a sub-cube to another
        one that has a common face with it

<p>

Thanks to John Tripp for the following explanation:<p>
<pre>
The mouse can not finish at the middle cube.
To understand why:

Number the sub-cubes as follows

Layer 1 (Top)
  1   2   3
  4   5   6
  7   8   9

Layer 2 (Middle)
10 11 12
13 14 15
16 17 18

Layer 3 (Bottom)
19 20 21
22 23 24
25 26 27

Notice, for the mouse to make a "legal" move, it must move to an even
numbered sub-cube from an odd numbered sub-cube, and, move to an odd
numbered sub-cube from an even numbered sub-cube.

These means that the, if the mouse begins on a corner sub-cube, the mouse
will progress in the series - O E O E O E ....... , and the last sub-cube
must be an odd numbered one.  However, the center cube is even numbered,
and therefore can not be the last sub-cube visited.

Another view might be easier for some to understand,  You could color the
sub-cubes, in a checkerboard pattern.

Layer 1 (Top)
  B  W  B
  W  B  W
  B  W  B

Layer 2 (Middle)
  W  B  W
  B  W  B
  W  B  W

Layer 3 (Bottom)
  B  W  B
  W  B  W
  B  W  B

In this case, for the mouse to make a "legal" move, it must move to a Black
sub-cube from a White sub-cube, and, move to a White sub-cube from a Black
sub-cube.

These means that the, if the mouse begins on a corner sub-cube, the mouse
will progress in the series - B  W  B  W  B  W ....... , and the last
sub-cube must be a Black one.  However, the center cube is White, and thus
can not be the last sub-cube visited.
