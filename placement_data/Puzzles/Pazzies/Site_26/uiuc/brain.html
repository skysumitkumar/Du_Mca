  <li> <b>Dreamy Women</b> <i><font color="green">(Expert)</font></i><p>
 In a fantasy world, women were bestowed with an exceptional power: every
 night, they could dream about all the men, other than their own husband, in the country who were thieves. For
 example, if some woman dreamt about 5 men, she could not be sure about how many men were really thieves: it could be 5 or 6 (because
 she did not know anything about her husband). However, they could
not discuss their dreams with each other because that was considered a
taboo subject.
 One day, the queen of the country declared: "I know a number of men in the
 country are thieves. I want their wives to kill them."
<p>
 Now the situation was as such: the women could not talk to each other
 about their dreams. However, if some woman killed her husband, it
was proclaimed throughout the country.
<p>
 Nothing happened after the declaration of the queen before the sixteenth day,
 when a number of women killed their husbands on the same morning.
<p>

 How many husbands were killed? You must include an explanation of your
answer.

  <li><b>Two Clocks</b> <i><font color="green">(Intermediate)</font></i><p>
<p>
This is a <font color="blue">Raymond Smullyan</font> puzzle.<p>
Two friends, whom we will call Arthur and Robert, were curators at the
Museum of American History. Both were born in the month of May, one in
1932 and the other a year later.
<p>

Each was in charge of a beautiful antique clock. Both of the clocks worked
pretty well, considering their ages, but one of them lost ten seconds an
hour and the other gained ten seconds an hour.
<p>

On one bright day in January, the two friends set both clocks right at
exactly 12 noon.
<p>

``You realize,'' said Arthur, ``that the clocks will start drifting apart,
and they won't be together again until---let's see---why, on the very day
you will be 47 years old. Am I right?''
<p>

Robert then made a short calculation. ``That's right!'' he said.
<p>

Who is older, Arthur or Robert?

  <li> <a name="caliban"><b>Caliban's Will</b></a> <i><font color="green">(Master)</font></i><p>
This is an original creation by <font color="blue">M.H. Newman</font>
<p>
When Caliban's will was opened it was found to contain the following
clause:
<p>

"I leave ten of my books to each of Low, Y.Y., and 'Critic,' who are
to choose in a certain order.
<p>

No person who has seen me in a green tie is to choose before Low.
<p>

If Y.Y. was not in Oxford in 1920 the first chooser never lent me
an umbrella.
<p>

If Y.Y. or 'Critic' has second choice, 'Critic' comes before the one
who first fell in love."
<p>

Unfortunately Low, Y.Y., and 'Critic' could not remember any of the
relevant facts; but the family solicitor pointed out that, assuming the
problem to be properly constructed (i.e. assuming it to contain no
statement superfluous to its solution) the relevant data and order
could be inferred.
<p>

What was the prescribed order of choosing; and who lent Caliban an
umbrella?

  <li><b>Amazing Maze</b> <i><font color="green">(Intermediate)</font></i><p>
This is a maze.  The object is to start at the upper left hand corner, (1)
and to make it to the lower right hand corner.  A number says how far
you <b>must</b> move to get to the next spot.  You may move any direction,
vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.  A number that specifies movement
off the board is a "dead end".
<pre>
1   5   3   4   3   6   7   1   1   6

4   4   3   4   2   6   2   6   2   5

1   3   9   4   5   2   4   2   9   5

9   2   3   6   5   6   2   2   2   EXIT
</pre>
Solutions must be specified as a sequence of directions e.g. e, se, w, n,
e ... The number of steps to be taken in a particular direction is
determined by the value of that particular position in the maze. Thus for
the given sequence we start by going one step east from the top left
corner, then 5 steps south-east, then 5 steps west, and so on.

<b>The Harvest Journey</b> <i><font color="green">(Master)</font></i><p>

  In a remote area, several villages are located, such that there is only

Meeting Place where members of the villages meet to exchange goods, ideas,
goodwill, etc.

  The highlight of the year is the Harvest Journey.  After the harvest,
all able bodied members of the villages travel to The Meeting Place for a
great celebration.  After the meeting, some will return to their own
villages, while others will travel to one of the other villages to spend
the winter.
<p>

  What is the maximum number of villages and the distance from The Meeting
Place to each village?, if:
<ol>
  <li>   A journey is the total number of halongs(The unit of distance used
by the villagers.) from the Starting Village to The Meeting Place to the
Ending Village. (Therefore, If there are 3 villages A,B,C, there would be
six possible journeys - AA,AB,AC,BB,BC, and CC)
 <li>   Every possible journey is an integer number of halongs.
  <li>   No possible journey, from start to end, is the same distance as
any other possible journey.
  <li>   No village is more than 100 halongs from The Meeting Place.
  <li>   A journey may begin and end at the same village.
   <li>  Each village is located as close to The Meeting Place as possible,
consistent with conditions 1-5.
