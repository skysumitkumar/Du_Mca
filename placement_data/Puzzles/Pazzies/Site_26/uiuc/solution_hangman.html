<font color="blue">Question:</font><br>
A victim is given a choice for his probable form of punishment. He is asked to state a sentence and if the
                             statement is true he will be shot and if it is false he will be hanged. And he states something about himself which makes him
                             ineligible for both forms of punishment. What does he say? 

<p>
<font color="blue">Answer:</font><br>
"I am going to be hanged"
