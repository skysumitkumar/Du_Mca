<font color="blue">Question:</font><br>
In a chemical plant, there are 10 machines that produce tablets. All but 1 machine (the defective one!) produce 10 gram tablets. The defective machine produces 9 gram tablets. You are allowed to take as many tablets from all or any of the machines once and only once. You are allowed only one weighing on an electronic weighing scale (i.e., it will tell you the exact weight in grams). After this weighing you should be able to point out the defective machine. How would you do it? (Note: you have no estimation skills and simply rely on the weighing machine) 
<p>
<font color="blue">Answer (there are other solutions using the same concept):</font><br>
 Take n tablets from machine n for a total of 55 tablets. Place all
55 on the scale. Subtract the total weight in grams from 550. The result
is the number of the defective machine.
