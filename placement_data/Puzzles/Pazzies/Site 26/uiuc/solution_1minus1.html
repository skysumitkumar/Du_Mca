<pre>
-1 = -1

This can be represented as
1 / (-1) = (-1) / 1

Take square roots of both sides
sqrt(1 / (-1)) = sqrt((-1) / 1)

This is the same as saying
sqrt(1) / sqrt(-1) = sqrt(-1) / sqrt(1)

Multiply both sides by sqrt(-1) * sqrt(1)
sqrt(1) * sqrt(1) = sqrt(-1) * sqrt(-1)

i.e.
1 = -1

</pre>
What is the problem with this proof?<p>

Thanks to <font color="blue">Siddhartha Mathur</font> for this explanation:<p>
 when you square root you have to put in a +- sign there,
because 
 sqrt(36) = sqrt (36) does not imply
 6 = -6 ! the rest of the steps are just trying to confuse the issue
