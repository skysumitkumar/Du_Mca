<font color="blue">Question:</font><br>
 In a fantasy world, women were bestowed with an exceptional power: every
 night, they could dream about all the men, other than their own husband, in the
 country who were thieves. For
 example, if some woman dreamt about 5 men, she could not be sure about how many
 men were really thieves: it could be 5 or 6 (because
 she did not know anything about her husband). However, they could
not discuss their dreams with each other because that was considered a
taboo subject.
 One day, the queen of the country declared: "I know a number of men in the
 country are thieves. I want their wives to kill them."
<p> 
 Now the situation was as such: the women could not talk to each other
 about their dreams. However, if some woman killed her husband, it
was proclaimed throughout the country. 
<p> 
 Nothing happened after the declaration of the queen before the sixteenth day,
 when a number of women killed their husbands on the same morning.
<p> 
 
 How many husbands were killed? You must include an explanation of your
answer.

<p>
<font color="blue">Answer:</font><br>
The number of husbands killed was 16. 
<p>
Suppose that there was only one thief. Then, his wife would not dream of
any thieves on the first night. However, since the queen has stated that
there is at least one thief in the land, she (the wife) would realize that
her husband is a thief, and would kill him the next day. Thus, if there
was only one thief, he would get killed on the first day following the
proclamation.
<p>
Similarly, if there were only two thieves, their wives would dream of only
thief. So they would wait one day, and since nobody would get killed on
the first day, they would realize that there has to be more than one
thief, and so their own husband must be a thief. Thus, if there are two
thieves, they would both be killed on the second day following the
proclamation.
<p>
Continuing in this manner, we see that 16 men would be killed on the 16th
day.
