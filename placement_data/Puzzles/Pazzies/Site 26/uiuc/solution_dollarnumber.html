<font color="blue">Question:</font><br>
Call a number n &gt 0 a "dollar number" if there is a way to make exactly
one US dollar with exactly "n" US coins (denominations $.01, $.05, $.10,
$.25, $.50, and $1.00).  What is the smallest n &gt 0 that is not a dollar
number?
<p>
To make things clearer, for example, 4 is not a dollar number since 4 quarters make a dollar. 5 isn't a dollar
number either because you can have .50 + 0.25 + 0.10 + 0.10 + 0.05 = 1.00.

77 <p>
<pre>
For n = 1 to 4 there are obvious combinations of 1.00, .50, and .25.
For n = 5 and 6, use 1.00 = .50 + .25 + .10 + .10 + .05, then .50 = 2*.25.
For n = 7 to 9, use 1.00 = 2*.25 + 5*.10, then apply .10 = 2*.05 twice.
For n = 10 to 19, use 1.00 = 10*.10 and apply .10 = 2*.05 nine times.
For n = 20 to 76, vary the breakdown of the first 30 cents from 3 to 6
        coins using .30 = 3*.10 = 2*.10 + 2*.05 = .10 + 4*.05 = 6*.05;
        the remaining 70 cents starts out as nickels which you convert
        to pennies one at a time, raising the count by 4 each time.
        Thus you get from 20 nickels to 70 pennies and 6 nickels.

To get 77 coins, suppose these include 5k pennies (must have a
multiple of 5 because every other coin is congruent to 0 mod 5 cents).
Then the remaining 100 - 5k cents must consist of 77 - 5k coins.
Since each remaining coin is worth at least 5 cents, the non-penny
value in cents is at least 5 times the non-penny coin count:

   100 - 5k  >=  5 * (77 - 5k)

By algebra:

   20 - k  >=  77 - 5k
   4k  >=  57
   k  >=  57/4 = 14.25

Since k is an integer, k >= 15, i.e. we must have at least 5*15 = 75
pennies.  We can't have more because 5*16 = 80 is already greater than
77.  But then we must find exactly two coins to add up to the
remaining 25 cents.  By exhaustive search we show there is no such
combination.  We can't make 1.00 in 77 coins.
