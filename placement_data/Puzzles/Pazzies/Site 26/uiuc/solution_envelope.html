<font color="blue">Question:</font><br>
I have three envelopes. Two of them are empty and one of them has a $100 bill. 
These are pretty good envelopes and you can't cheat by seeing through them. :) 
You then pick one envelope. I peek into the other two envelopes. Obviously at 
least one of these envelopes in empty. I throw away one of these empty envelopes 
(if only one was empty, I throw that one away, if both are empty I pick one at 
random and then throw it away). Now I ask you to rethink your choice, giving you 
the option to choose the other envelope instead. Should you stick to your 
choice, or should you switch your choice to the other envelope? Or does it not 
make any difference? Remember, you really want the $100 bill, so you are trying 
to maximize your chances!

You should switch. This could get confusing, but simply think of it this way:
When you first pick the envelope, you have a 33.33% chance of being right. That is, I have a 66.67% chance of having the envelope with the money. Even after throwing one envelope away, the probability that I still have the envelope with the money still remains as 66.67%. So you should switch.
<p>
It might also help to think of an exaggerated case in which we're playing with 1000 envelopes, and if I threw 998 away. Would you switch? Of course! You started with a chance of 1 in 1000, so it's almost guaranteed (99.9% guarantee, :)) that the other envelope is the one with the money! 
<p>Not satisfied yet? Well actually there is a lot of controversy about this problem. It's also known as the Monty Hall problem. Here are some interesting links:
