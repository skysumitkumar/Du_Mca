<font color="blue">Question:</font><br>
A prisoner is given 2 bowls, 100 red balls, and 100 white balls. He is
told to put the balls into the bowls any way he wishes, as long as there
is at least one ball in each bowl. He cannot leave any balls out. The
Executioner will come in and reach into a random bowl and draw out a ball.
If it is red, the prisoner dies. If it is white, he goes free. How should
the prisoner arrange the 200 balls so that he has the greatest possibility
of going free?
<p>
<font color="blue">Answer:</font><br>
Put one white ball in one bowl, and all the other balls in the other bowl. The probability that the prisoner will go free is = 50 + 50*100*(99/199), approximately 75%.

Alternate solution by Jacqueline:<br> 
Scrape the paint off the red balls, and you'll be left with all white balls. :-)
