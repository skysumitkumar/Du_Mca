<font color="blue">Question:</font><br>
Construct a regular pentagon by using only a compass and a straight edge. Send us a description of your construction along with a proof (or an adequate explanation) showing that your construction is correct.

<p>
<font color="blue">Answer:</font><br>

Thanks to <font color="blue">Glenn</font> for these three points:
<p>
Note 1: a straight edge does *not* contain a scale.  Measuring
 distances by using a scale is not an allowed operation in
 classical compass/straightedge constructions.
<p>
 Note 2: There is no solution to the regular heptagon nor the
 regular nonagon.  A regular n-gon is constructible using only
 a straightedge and a compass if and only if n is 3, 5, 17, 257,
 or 65537 (due to Gauss I believe).  These values can be obtained
 from the formula 2^2^k + 1 where k is an integer from 0 through 4.
 These values are known as the Fermat primes (k=5 does not yield
 a prime).
<p>
Note 3: They are called Fermat primes after Pierre Fermat (the
"t" is silent) who in the 17th century conjectured that all
numbers of the form 2^2^k are prime. The conjecture was shown
to be false when the value for k=5 was factored in the first
half of the 20'th century.

</FONT><P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
<P>The problem is to construct a regular pentagon (all five sides and angles equal) using only a pencil, compass and straight edge.  I would expect this is very difficult unless you have seen it before somewhere, so even if you forgot how to do it, you could try a few things and rediscover it.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">SOLUTION</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
<P>Convention:  A line connecting point &quot;A&quot; with point &quot;B&quot; is referred to as &quot;line AB&quot;, and its length is &quot;AB&quot;.  Also the distance between point &quot;A&quot; and point &quot;B&quot; is &quot;AB&quot; whether or not there is a line.  An arc is referred to as &quot;arc AB&quot;, meaning the shorter of the two possible arcs connecting &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, where &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are point on a circle or part of a circle.</P>

<P>1.  Draw a circle somewhere on your paper of the size that will circumscribe the pentagon. Label the center &quot;O&quot;.</P>

<P>2.  Draw a diameter approximately vertical, obviously passing through &quot;O&quot;.</P>

<P>3.  Using the compass and straight edge, draw a diameter perpendicular to the first diameter.</P>

<P>4.  Label the points where the diameters intersect the circle &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, and &quot;D&quot;, starting with &quot;A&quot; at the top and going clockwise.</P>

<P>5.  Using the compass and straight edge, bisect line &quot;OB&quot;, and label the point &quot;E&quot;.</P>

<P>6.  With the compass, use &quot;E&quot; as the center and distance &quot;AE&quot; as the radius, draw an arc intersecting line &quot;DO&quot;.  Label the point &quot;F&quot;.</P>

<P>7.  With the compass, use &quot;A&quot; as the center and distance &quot;AF&quot; as the radius, draw an arc intersecting arc &quot;AB&quot; and arc &quot;AD&quot;.  Label the points &quot;G&quot; and &quot;H&quot;.</P>

<P>8.  Using the straightedge, draw a line connect points &quot;A&quot; and &quot;G&quot; and points &quot;A&quot; and &quot;H&quot;.  These lines are two sides of the pentagon.</P>

<P>9. With the compass, use &quot;G&quot; as the center and &quot;AG&quot; as the radius (i.e., don’t change the adjustment on the compass), draw an arc intersecting arc &quot;CD&quot;, and label the point &quot;I&quot;.</P>

<P>10.  Move the center to &quot;H&quot;, and use &quot;AH&quot; as the radius to draw an arc intersecting arc &quot;BC&quot;.  Label the point &quot;J&quot;.</P>

<P>11.  Connect points &quot;G&quot; and &quot;I&quot;, &quot;I&quot; and &quot;J&quot;, and &quot;J&quot; and &quot;H&quot;.  This completes the polygon.</P>

<P>Considering that you have to use finite-sized lines, arcs, and points, errors could accumulate so that if you use &quot;I&quot; as a center and swing an arc through arc &quot;BC&quot;, it may miss point &quot;J&quot; by a few line widths.  However, it can be proven that the construction is exact.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">PROOF</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
<P>There may be more elegant solutions, but a brute force solution is presented below. </P>

<P>1.  Use the figure and point labels as drawn to construct the polygon, and assume the radius, &quot;AO&quot;, equals one is some system of units.</P>

<P>2.  &quot;OE&quot; =  ½ and&quot;AO&quot; = 1, are the sides of a right triangle.</P>

<P>3. The hypotenuse, &quot;AE&quot; = (1<SUP>2</SUP> + (½)<SUP>2</SUP>)<SUP>½</SUP> = (5/4)<SUP>½</SUP> = 5 <SUP>½</SUP>/2.</P>

<P>4.  As &quot;EF&quot; = &quot;AE&quot;, &quot;OF&quot; = &quot;EF&quot; - &quot;OE&quot; = &quot;AE&quot; -&quot;OE&quot; = 5 <SUP>½</SUP>/2 -1/2 = ½(5 <SUP>½</SUP>-1).</P>

<P>5.  &quot;AO&quot; and &quot;OF&quot; are sides of a right triangle with hypotenuse &quot;AF&quot;.  Thus, &quot;AF&quot; can be calculated as follows: &quot;AF&quot; = (1<SUP>2</SUP> + (½(5 <SUP>½</SUP>-1))<SUP>2</SUP>)<SUP>½</SUP> = (1 + 1/4(5 - 2x5 <SUP>½</SUP> + 1))<SUP>½</SUP> = (1 + ½(3 - 5 <SUP>½</SUP>))<SUP>½</P>
</SUP><P>= (5/2 - 5 <SUP>½</SUP>/2)<SUP>½</SUP>.</P>

<P>6.  AS &quot;AF&quot; = &quot;AG&quot;, &quot;AG&quot; = (5/2 - 5 <SUP>½</SUP>/2)<SUP>½</SUP>, which we allege is the length of each of the sides of the pentagon.</P>

<P>7.  We draw line &quot;OG&quot;, and note that &quot;AG&quot; plus &quot;AO&quot; and &quot;OG&quot; form a triangle with sides 1, 1, and (5/2 - 5 <SUP>½</SUP>/2)<SUP>½</SUP>.  We name the angle &quot;AOG&quot; formed at the center of the circle by lines &quot;AO&quot; and &quot;OG&quot;.</P>

<P>8. Bisect line &quot;AG&quot; and label the point &quot;K&quot;.  Since sides &quot;AO&quot;, &quot;AK&quot;, and &quot;KO&quot; form a triangle whose sides equal the sides of another triangle, &quot;GO&quot;, &quot;GK&quot;, and &quot;KO&quot; , The two angles at point &quot;K&quot; are equal and sum to 180<SUP>o</SUP>, they are 90<SUP>o</SUP> angles. &quot;AK&quot; = ½ of &quot;AG&quot; or ½ (5/2 - 5 <SUP>½</SUP>/2)<SUP>½</SUP>, and from AK<SUP>2 </SUP>+ KO<SUP>2</SUP> = 1, KO<SUP>2</SUP> = 1 - 1/4(5/2 - 5 <SUP>½</SUP>/2) = (3 + 5 <SUP>½</SUP>)/8, and KO = ((3 + 5 <SUP>½</SUP>)/8)<SUP>½</SUP>.</P>

<P>Sin AOK = ½ (5/2 - 5 <SUP>½</SUP>/2)<SUP>½</SUP>  = ((5 - 5 <SUP>½</SUP>)/8)<SUP>½</SUP> and cos AOK = ((3 + 5 <SUP>½</SUP>)/8)<SUP>½</SUP>.</P>

<P>Sin AOG = sin 2AOK = 2sin AOK cos AOK = 2 ((5 - 5 <SUP>½</SUP>)/8)<SUP>½</SUP>((3 + 5 <SUP>½</SUP>)/8)<SUP>½</SUP> = ((5 + 5 <SUP>½</SUP>)/8)<SUP>½</SUP>.</P>

<P>If it a regular pentagon, AOG = 72<SUP>o</SUP>, which can be checked easily enough with a calculator, but a calculator isn’t exact due to the limitation on the number of significant figures.  So we continue by looking up the formula for sin 5AOG:</P>

<P>Sin 5AOG = 5 sin AOG - 20 sin<SUP>3</SUP>AOG +16 sin<SUP>5</SUP>AOG.</P>

<P>For convenience, we write down sin<SUP>2</SUP>AOG = (5 + 5 <SUP>½</SUP>)/8, then</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>sin<SUP>3</SUP>AOG = (5 + 5 <SUP>½</SUP>)/8((5 + 5 <SUP>½</SUP>)/8)<SUP>½</SUP>, and sin<SUP>5</SUP>AOG = ((5 + 5 <SUP>½</SUP>)/8)<SUP>2</SUP>((5 + 5 <SUP>½</SUP>)/8)<SUP>½</SUP>, and</P>

<P>sin 5AOG = 5((5 + 5 <SUP>½</SUP>)/8)<SUP>½</SUP> - 20(5 + 5 <SUP>½</SUP>)/8((5 + 5 <SUP>½</SUP>)/8)<SUP>½</SUP> +16 ((5 + 5 <SUP>½</SUP>)/8)<SUP>2</SUP>((5 + 5 <SUP>½</SUP>)/8)<SUP>½</SUP>.</P>

<P>Factor out ((5 + 5 <SUP>½</SUP>)/8)<SUP>½</SUP> to get</P>

<P>sin 5AOG =((5 + 5 <SUP>½</SUP>)/8)<SUP>½</SUP> (5- 20(5 + 5 <SUP>½</SUP>)/8 +16 ((5 + 5 <SUP>½</SUP>)/8)<SUP>2</SUP>).</P>

<P>Evaluate the expression (5- 20(5 + 5 <SUP>½</SUP>)/8 +16 ((5 + 5 <SUP>½</SUP>)/8)<SUP>2</SUP>) to get &quot;0", so</P>

<P>sin 5AOG =((5 + 5 <SUP>½</SUP>)/8)<SUP>½</SUP>(0) = 0, and therefore 5AOG = 0<SUP>o</SUP> or 360<SUP>o</SUP> and knowing from the construction that AOG is something less than 90<SUP>o</SUP>, 5AOG can only be 360<SUP>o</SUP>, so the solution is exact.</P>
