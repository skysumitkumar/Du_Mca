<font color="blue">Question:</font><br>
There is a room with three lightbulbs. The three switches to these lightbulbs are
                outside the room, and the door is closed. You are outside the room and cannot see
                anything inside the room since the door is closed. You are allowed to enter the
                room only once, and once you are inside the room you need to determine which
                lightbulb corresponds to which switch! Remember, once you open the door, you
                must enter the room! Is this possible? If so, how?

Thanks to Rick Deschenes for the explanation!<p>

Turn on switch one and leave on for 5 minutes.<br>
Turn off switch one and turn on switch two.<br>
Enter room. Feel the bulbs that are off. The cool one is switch three,<br>
the warm one is
switch one and of course the lit bulb is switch two.
