Give a 10 digit number that has all the digits from 0 to 9 in it. The number is such that the first digit is divisible by 1.
                             First 2 digits divisible by 2, first 3 by 3, first 4 by 4, so on and finally the ten digit number is divisible by 10. Explain
                             your answer.

<pre>
 The number is 3816547290

a)  The even digits have to be placed in even places (divisibility by
    2)   and hence odd digits in odd places.
b) The 10th digit has to be 0 and fifth hence has to be 5.
c) Sum of first 3 digits have to be divisible by 3 and sum of 4th,
   5th and 6th have to be divisible by 3 as 3 and 6 both have 3 as a
   factor and divisibility test for 3.
d) Number obtained from 6th, 7th and 8th digit in our case 472 has to
   be divisible by 8 , divisibility test for 8.
e) 4th digit has to be either 2 or 6 as 3rd digit is odd and by
   divisibility test for 4.
