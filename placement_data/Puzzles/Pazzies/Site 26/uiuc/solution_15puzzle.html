<font color="blue">Question:</font><br>
Let the initial configuration of a 15 puzzle be, for example:
<pre>
1  3  4  15
*  2  5  11
6  7  12 9
10 13 14 8
</pre>
* denotes an empty position.

Can it be rearranged to the following final arrangement?
<pre>
1  2  3  4
5  6  7  8
9  10 11 12
13 14 15 *
</pre>
Please do not send us the sequence of moves.
We just want a yes/no answer, and a general explanation which could be used to test any <i>15 Puzzle</i> problem. The final configuration will always be the same.

<p>
<font color="blue">Answer:</font><br>
The answer is no. 
<p>
The general rule is: <p>
Let less(i) = num(j), such that j &lt i, and pos(j) &gt pos(i)
(consider the blank tile to be '16')
<p>
Here less(11) = 5, since 5 numbers less than 11 appear after 11 in
initial configuration. (numbering in row major order - left to right)

Also, for an initial configuration of the form<br>
*#*#<br>
#*#*<br>
*#*#<br>
#*#*<br>
x = 1, if the blank position is in # position above, i.e., in our initial
config, x = 1. Otherwise x = 0.
<p>
The rule is: goal state is reachable iff sum(i = 1 to 15) less(i) + x is
even.
<p>Here is an alternative solution by <font color="blue">John Tripp</font>:<br>
<pre>
Use some kind of markers (cards, tags, etc) and place them to represent the
layout
         1       3       4       15
         *       2       5       11
         6       7       12      9
         10      13      14      8

Step 1)  "Normalize the position" Slide markers so that empty cell is at
bottom right corner.
         There are many ways to do this.  It doesn't matter how you achieve
the position!  For example:
         1       3       4       15
         6       2       5       11
         10      7       12      9
         13      14      8       *

Step 2)  Begin at final position 1.  If the number in the position is
correct, do nothing Otherwise, switch the marker with the marker representing the correct position.  In this case, marker 1 is already in correct position, so no switch is made.

tep 3) Repeat step 2 for positions 2-15.  Keep track of number of switches
made as a result of step 2.
         Example  {n} indicates markers to switch
Switch 1
         1       {3}     4       15
         6       {2}     5       11
         10      7       12      9
         13      14      8       *
Switch 2
         1       2       {4}     15
         6       {3}     5       11
         10      7       12      9
         13      14      8       *
Switch 3
         1       2       3       {15}
         6       {4}     5       11
         10      7       12      9
         13      14      8       *
Switch 4
         1       2       3       4
         {6}     15      {5}     11
         10      7       12      9
         13      14      8       *
Switch 5
         1       2       3       4
         5       {15}    {6}     11
         10      7       12      9
         13      14      8       *
Switch 6
         1       2       3       4
         5       6       {15}    11
         10      {7}     12      9
         13      14      8       *
Switch 7
         1       2       3       4
         5       6       7       {11}
         10      15      12      9
         13      14      {8}     *
Switch 8
         1       2       3       4
         5       6       7       8
         {10}    15      12      {9}
         13      14      11      *
Switch 9
         1       2       3       4
         5       6       7       8
         9       {15}    12      {10}
         13      14      11      *
Switch 10
         1       2       3       4
         5       6       7       8
         9       10      {12}    15
         13      14      {11}    *
Switch 11
         1       2       3       4
         5       6       7       8
         9       10      11      {15}
         13      14      {12}    *
Done after 11 switches
         1       2       3       4
         5       6       7       8
         9       10      11      12
         13      14      15      *
Of course, one could be much more efficient in selecting the switches to make.
In any event, if the number of switches is odd (as in this case) we can not
solve to position in the slide puzzle
         If the number of switches is even the slide puzzle position can be
solved.
