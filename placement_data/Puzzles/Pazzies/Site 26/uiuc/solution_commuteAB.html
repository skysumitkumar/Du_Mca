<font color="blue">Question:</font><br>
The Mayor of a city C couldn't help but notice that a large population traveled from point A to point B and back
                   everyday. Moreover, there was no straightforward route, and the commute was long and winding. The Mayor thought it
                   would be a great idea to build an expressway from point A to point B. This would drastically reduce the time for the
                   commute. To the Mayor's surprise, after the expressway was opened, none of these people traveled from point A to B
                   any more. 
<p>
                   What was the reason?

People were actually going to point B to see the city's famous Snowy Owl
preserve.  The noise of building the expressway, however, combined with the
removal of several trees to make room for the route (amidst much protest by
the local wildlife community), frightened off the owls, thus removing the
desire to travel to point B.

There was a strip mine at B, and many people living at A worked there.
About the time the Mayor completed his road the ore ran out, and
nobody wanted to go to an abandoned strip-mine.

Before the expressway was built, the mail, because of the length of the
journey from A to B, although it was actually in the same city, took
several days, so instead of using the postal service, many people
delivered their own mail, or hired couriers to travel the route for
them.  After the expressway was built, the postal service started using
a route which utilized the expressway, and so the couriers and personal
deliveries were no longer needed.

After the expressway was made they were able to go from A to C instead
of A to B to C.<br>
<b>Comment:</b> This is an interesting solution, however the Mayor would have noticed that the people
were traveling from A to C.

    The business located at point 'B' was aware that it was a long
 winding commute from 'A' to 'B', and would allow the time for the
 commute to be part of an employee's 'paid' workday, as well as
 compensating for gas and millage.  With the new expressway, the business
 no longer compensated the employees.  Without the extra comp, the
 employees decided to find other employment.
