<font color="blue">Question:</font><br>
There are two bars of iron. One bar is magnetized along its length, while the other is not magnetized. Using
                           just the two bars, without any other items, how can you tell which bar is magnetized and which is not? 

<p>
<font color="blue">Answer:</font><br>
Place the two magnets in the form of a T. Let A be the vertical magnet in the "T", and B be the horizontal magnet in the "T". Since a bar magnet has no magnetic effect at the middle, if B is the magnet, then A and B would not attract each other in this configuration. If A was the magnet, then it's magnetic effect would be the strongest at the end and it would attract B.
