<font color="blue">Question:</font><br>
What is the lowest number which, when written out in words, requires that the five vowels appear exactly <i>once each</i>, in its spelling? 


<p>
<font color="blue">Answer:</font><br>
Two Hundred and Six

<p>
A lot of people answered Five Thousand without realizing that 'and' is also a valid part of the name. Andrea Wiggins came up with a terrific solution: five thousandths. This is in fact smaller than 206!
<p>
So we conclude that the smallest natural number would be 206, but the smallest number is actually five thousandths.

But then again, we just heard from Andy Bouwman, who pointed out that "six ten-thousandths" is smaller than "five thousandths." Should we ask the linguists who is correct? Well, as long as we keep receiving creative solutions, we'll put them up here...
