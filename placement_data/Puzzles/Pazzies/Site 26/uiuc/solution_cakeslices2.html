<font color="blue">Question:</font><br>
You probably solved the previous puzzle using trial and error, now can you generalize the solution for n straight lines? What is the solution for 21 straight lines?


<p>
<font color="blue">Answer:</font><br>

By giving the number as small as 8, it becomes a trial and error logic 
puzzle, and by giving a high number for example 21-22 it becomes
an intermediate/expert level math puzzle.
<p>
By observation,
<pre>
no. of straight lines(x)    no. of regions(y)
   1                         2
   2                         4
   3                         7
   4                         11
</pre>

This is the value when x=1,2,3,4...<br>
If you see the sequence y=f(x) has second difference constant<br>
first difference 4-2=2,  7-4=3  11-7=4<br>
second difference = 3-2=1, 4-3=1<p>

  Since second difference is constant y is a second order equation
in x.<br>
let y= ax^2 + bx + c<br>
Solving this at x=1,y=2 ,  x=2,y=4, and x=3,y=7<br>
you get 3 equations in a,b,c which are very easily solvable<p>

Finally y =0.5 x^2 + 0.5 x + 1<br>
  When x=4, y=11<br>
   when x=8, y=37<br>
   when x=21, y=232.<br>
