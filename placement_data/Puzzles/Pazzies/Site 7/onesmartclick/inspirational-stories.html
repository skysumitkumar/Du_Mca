<center>Generously Supported <b> by Aditi (Mamta) Mhatre</b></center><br>
 

<p>The longer I live, the more I realize the impact of
attitude on life. Attitude to me is more important
than facts. It is more important than the past, than
education, than failures than successes than what
other people think or say or do. It is more important
than appearance, giftedness or skills. It will break a
company … a church … a home.</p>

<p>The remarkable thing is we have a choice everyday
regarding the attitude we will embrace for that day we
cannot change our past we cannot change the fact that
people will act in certain way we cannot change
inevitable. The only thing we can do is play on one
string we have and that is out attitude.</p>

<p>I am convinced that life is 10% what happens to me and
90% how I react to it. And so it is with you… we are
in charge of out attitude.</p>

<center><b>The Cleaning Lady</b></center><br>
 

During my second month of nursing school, our professor gave us a pop quiz. 
I was a conscientious student and had breezed through the questions, 
until I read the last one: <br><br>
"What is the first name of the woman who cleans the school?" Surely 
this was some kind of joke. I had seen the cleaning woman several times. 
She was tall, dark-haired and in her 50s, but how would I know her name?  
I handed in my paper, leaving the last question blank. Before class 
ended, one student asked if the last question would count toward our 
quiz grade.  "Absolutely," said the professor. "In your careers you 
will meet many people. All are significant.  
They deserve your attention and care, even if all you do is smile 
and say  'Hello'."<br><br>

I've never forgotten that lesson.  I also learned her name was Dorothy.

<center><b>A Little Boys Temper</b></center><br>
 

<p>There once was a little boy who had a bad temper. His father gave 
him a bag of nails and told him that every time he lost his temper, 
he must hammer a nail into the fence.</p>
 
<p>The first day the boy had driven 37 nails into the fence. Over the 
next few weeks as he learned to control his anger, the number of nails 
hammered daily, gradually dwindled down. He discovered it was easier to
hold his temper than to drive those nails into the fence. 
Finally the day came when the boy didn't lose his temper at 
all. He told his father about it and the father suggested that 
the boy now pull out one nail for each day that he was able to 
hold his temper.</p>
 
<p>The days passed and the young boy was finally able to tell his 
father that all the nails were gone. The father took his son by 
the hand and led him to the fence. He said "you have done well,
my son, but look at the holes in the fence. The fence will never 
be the same. When you say things in anger, they leave a scar just 
like this one."</p>
 
<p>You can put a knife in a man and draw it out. It won't matter 
how many times you say I'm sorry, the wound is still there.</p>
 
<p>Make sure you control your temper the next time you are tempted 
to say something you will regret later.</p>

<p>"The child whispered, 'God, speak to me'
And a meadow lark sang.
The child did not hear.
</p>
 
<p>So the child yelled, 'God, speak to me!'
And the thunder rolled across the sky
But the child did not listen.
</p>
 
<p>The child looked around and said,
'God let me see you' and a star shone brightly
But the child did not notice.
</p>
 
<p>And the child shouted,
'God show me a miracle!'
And a life was born but the child did not know.</p>
 
<p>So the child cried out in despair,
'Touch me God, and let me know you are here!'
Whereupon God reached down
And touched the child.
</p>
 
<p>
But the child brushed the butterfly away
And walked away unknowingly."

<center><b>Perspectives</b></center><br>
 

<p>One day a father and his rich family took his young son on a trip to the country with the firm purpose to show him how poor people can be.  They  spent a day and a night in the farm of a very poor family.  When they got back from their trip the father asked his son, "How was the trip?"

Very good, Dad!"

"Did you see how poor people can be?" the father asked.

"Yeah!"  "And what did you learn?"
</p>
 
<p>The son answered, "I saw that we have a dog at home, and they have four.  We have a pool that reaches to the middle of the garden, they have a creek that has no end.  We have imported lamps in the garden, they have the stars.  Our patio reaches to the front yard, they have a whole horizon.

When the little boy was finishing, his father was speechless.
</p>
 
<p>His son added, "Thanks, Dad, for showing me how poor we are!" Isn't it true that it all depends on the way you look at things?  If you have love, friends, family, health, good humor and a positive attitude toward life, you've got everything!</p>
 
<p>You can't buy any of these things.  You can have all the material possessions you can imagine, provisions for the future, etc., but if you are poor of spirit, you have nothing!

<center><b>Blurred Vision</b></center><br>
 

<p>A businessman was highly critical of his competitors' storefront windows. "Why, they are the dirtiest windows in town," he claimed. Fellow business people grew tired of the man's continual criticism and nitpicking comments about the windows. One day over coffee, the businessman carried the subject just too far. Before leaving, a fellow store owner suggested the man get his own windows washed. He followed the advice, and the next day at coffee, he exclaimed, "I can't believe it. As soon as I washed my windows, my competitor must have cleaned his too. You should see them shine."</p>

<p>A friend asked a gentleman how it is that he never married ?

Replied the gentleman, "Well, I guess I just never met the right woman ... I guess I've been looking for the perfect girl."

"Oh, come on now," said the friend, "Surely you have met at least on girl that you wanted to marry."
</p>
 
<p>"Yes, there was one girl .. once. I guess she was the one perfect girl .. the only perfect girl I really ever met. She was just the right everything .. I really mean that she was the perfect girl for me."

"Well, why didn't you marry her," asked the friend.

"She was looking for the perfect man," he said.

<center><b>Let Go...</b></center><br>
 

<p>The following is a very meaningful story which is called "Let Go", and written by Dr. Billy Graham.</p>
 
<p>A little child was playing one day with a very valuable vase. He put his hand into it and could not withdraw it. His father too, tried his best, but all in vain. They were thinking of breaking the vase when the father said, "Now, my son, make one more try. Open your hand and hold your fingers out straight as you see me doing, and then pull."
</p>

<p>
To their astonishment the little fellow said, "O no, father. I couldn't put my fingers out like that, because if I did I would drop my penny."</p>

<p>
Smile, if you will--but thousands of us are like that little boy, so busy holding on to the world's worthless penny that we cannot accept liberation. I beg you to drop the trifle in your heart. Surrender! Let go, and let God have His way in your life.
