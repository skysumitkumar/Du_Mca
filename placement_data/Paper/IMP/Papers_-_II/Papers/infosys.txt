        The names of the inhabitants of Walkie Talkie Land sound strange to the
	visitors, and they find it difficult to pronounce them, due to their
	length and a few vowel sounds they contain. The Walkie Talkie guide is
	discussing the names of four inhabitants - A,B,C and D. Their names
	each contain upto eight syllables, although none of the four names
	contain the same number. Two of the names contain no vowel sounds; one
	contains one vowel sound; and one contains two vowel sounds.

	From the Guide's statements below, determine the number of syllables
	and vowel sounds in each of the four Walkie Talkie names :

	i)  The one whose name contains two vowel sounds is not A.
	ii) C's name does not contain more than one vowel sound or fewer than
	    seven syllables.
	iii)The name with seven syllables does not contain exactly one vowel
	    sound.
	iv) B and C do not have names with the same number of vowel sounds.
	v)  Neither the name with five syllables nor the name with seven syllables
	    contains more than one vowel sound.
	vi) Neither the name with six syllables, nor the B's name, contains
	    two vowel sounds.

  *********************************************************************


This is the infosys paper given at IITMadras on 21.8.98
The no.s may not be correct.So try to get similar puzzles and workout.
This is informal version. So I will be explaining a bit here and
there;dont get confused.)
PROBLEM 1
Escalator problem. 
An escalator is descending at constant velocity. A walks down the
escalator and takes 50 steps to come down. B runs down and takes 75 to do
so.B can take 3 steps in the time taken by A to take 1 step.Find the
number of steps visible when the escalator is static.

PROBLEM 2
{no=number;This problem' English may be slightly confusing}
There are 1000 couples in a colony. Onethird of the husbands who are
taller than their wives are also heavier than their wives.Twothird of the
husbands who are heavier than their wives are also taller.If the no of
husbands who are neither heavier nor taller is 812 , find the no of
husbands who are both taller and heavier.

PROBLEM 3
There are two trainlines from a station,M(main)line & H(harbour)line.
Mainline trains come every 10 minutes .The first M train is at 5:00.
H trains also come every 10 minutes but the first H train is at 5:02.
If a man reaches the station at a random time, what is the probability
that he gets a M train?
VARA: Ans is 0.8

PROBLEM 4

strokes is observed to be 30 seconds. What will it be when the clock
strikes twelve?

       -------etc


THE REMAINING PROBLEMS, I COULD NOT REMEMBER PROPERLY. BUT I WILL EXPLAIN
WHAT EACH OF THEM IS ABOUT. TRY TO GET SIMILAR TYPES AND WORKOUT.

PROBLEM 6
In a bank there are 5 people.
Their names are given: Miss Brown, Miss Clara, Miss ---- , Mr Davis and
Mr #####
Each of them has a job inthe bank. The problem is to match them to
their jobs.
the jobs are :Manager,Clerk,Teller,floorwalker, *****.
Five conditions are given as clues.They look like:
1. Clerk and manager were roommates in college
2. Davis is going to be bestman for the wedding of X & Y
3. Floorwalker is a bachelor.
4. %%%%'wife complained that manager is not giving a raise in salary.
5. @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

(Clues from vara to you : Bestman means a bachelor.Roommates means they
are of same sex.Look for Miss and Mrs differences to know if they are
married.)

PROBLEM 7
Two families: Guptas & Sinhas. There are two sons in each family.
The four sons are @@@@,%%%%,^^^^ and ****.
Conditions with their ages are given. Problem is to find which fool is 
in which family and the correct ages.

PROBLEM 8
Football teams. This is a real lengthy problem.Around 8 conditions are
given with matches played, goals scored, etc.
You have to complete the table of scores. It looks like this:
TEAM Mplayed Mwon Mdrawn Mlost Goals

ETC
(I AM VERY SORRY THAT I COULDNOT REMAMBER ALL DETAILS. THE PROBLEM
HAD MANY MANY DETAILS.) 


PROBLEM 9
Two airports: Madras and Timbaktu(inAlexandria).Timbaktu has
TmbaktuStandardTime(TST) like IST.Two airplane services are
given in the time table.It is assumed that airplane takes same time
to travel from A to B and B to A.One space in timetable is empty 
You have to fill it.

Airport  Plane1           Plane2
Madras  dep 12:30IST    dep  18.00IST  (THE NO.S IN THIS PROBLEM ARE ALL
T       arr  1.45TST    arr  2.05 TST   WRONG.I COOKED THEM UP SINCE I 
M       dep 23.00IST    dep  3.55 ISI  WANTED TO EMPHASISE THE QUESTIONMK)
T       arr 22.00 TST    dep ?  TST     
CLUE FROM VARA:Assume 1 IST  =1+x TST

PROBLEM 10
This is a real cool problem. It looks like a monster and has 8 marks but
rather simple&timetaking.
Three tribes A, B & C are there in a community.
Three conditions like
 girl of A cannot marry a boy of B
 boy  of C cannot marry a girl of 
etc
No children are born of wedlock. Boy assumes father's tribetitle and
girl her mother's.
VARA: So, If a girl from B married a boy from C, and if a son is
born he will be of C tribe, if a girl is born she wii be of B tribe.

Some 15 statements are given. You have to write TRUE or FALSE.
Work out with a cool mind.This has 16% weightage.

ONCE AGAIN SORRY FOR NOT REMEMBERING FULLY.THEY WERE SO DETAILED TO
REMEMBER.

ALL THE BEST.
