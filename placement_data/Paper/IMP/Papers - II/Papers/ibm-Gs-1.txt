1.5% more than inflation rate which is of 6.5%  a year , then what wil be the
cost of a kg of paper after 2 years?
a)29.12 (b) 29.72 (c) 30.12 (d) 32.65 (e) none of these

2. In A,B,C are having some marbles with each of them. A has giben B and C the
s
ame number of marbles they already have to each of them. then, B gave C and A
the same no. of marbles they have, then C gave A and B the same no. of marbles
they have. At the
end A,B,and C have equal no. of marbles.
        (i) If x,y,z are the marbles initially with A,B,C respectively. then th
e no of
marbles B have at the end
        (a) 2(x-y-z) (b) 4(x-y-z)   etc.

        
        (ii)If the total no. of marbles are 72, then the no. of marbles with A
at the
starting
        a. 20 b. 30 c. 32

3. If a car starts from A towards B with some velocity due to some problem in
the engine after travelling 30km.If  the car goes with 4/5 th of its actuval
velocity the car reaches B 45min later to the actual time. If the car engine
fails ofter travelling
45km, the car reaches the destination B 36min late to the  actual time , what i
s
the initial velocity of car and what is the distance between A and B in km
 ans) 20 & 130.

4. A person has Rs 100/- in his pocket, he can as 25 pencils or 15books. He kep
t
15% of the money for travelling expenses and purchased 5 pencils.So how many
books he can purchase with the remaining money.

5. ten questions on analogies.
  ex: hammer : carpenter ::
                knife : butcher.

6. The values of shares A,B and C from january to june are as follows.

month           A       B       C

JAN             30      60      80
FEB             35      65      85

JUNE            50      75      80

i) During this period which share has undergone max fluctuation?

ii) In which month it is possible to buy B and C selling A?

iii) In which month the share values are very low?

iv) By purchasing one share of A and 4 each of B and C in the beginning of the
period , to get max profit when this shares should be sold?
v)  ?

7. In a computer institute 9 languages can taught. The module is of 6 months d
uration and only six languages  each of one month can be taught. In addition to
that BASIC is always there and should be in first month itself
 # word perfect is to be taught in the preceeding week of word star.
 # FORTRAN can not be taught until COBAL is coarsed prior to that
 # BINO, FIFO never be taught in single module
  languages are BASIC, WORD STAR, WORD PERFECT, FORTRAN, COBAL, BINO, FIFO,
LOTUS, C

 i. Of the following which module is possible based on above conditions.

ii) If word star is in 3rd month , what could be in 6th month.

iii) If COBAL is in the 2nd month and BINO in 6th month are there in addition t
o
the above condition, FORTRAN will be in which month.


8. In a class , except 18 all are above 50 years. 15 are below 50 years of age.

the size of the plate i.e. side

 a.17 b.14 c.13

10. In a square , all the mid points are joined. the inner square is shaded. If
the area of the square is A, what is the shaded area?

11. two questions on basic angles i.e given a circle, a few chords or diameter
is drawn etc.

12. @(a,b)= (a+b)/2
    /(a,b)= a.b
    *(a,b)= ab , if a=1, b=2 find
        i) /(a,(@(a,b),*(a,b)))

        ii)

13. (x#y) = x+y-xy
    (x*y) = (x+y)/2
  i) (x#y)#(x*y) < (x#y), which of the below values of x, y will satisfy this
equation

 ii) (a*b)#(b*c)< (a#b)*(b*c) , what values of a,b,c satisfy the above.

14. By using the data given below answer the following questions.

                        B.tech  M.sc    M.A

 male                   20
female                                  80

total                   60
         some thing similar to that question.
