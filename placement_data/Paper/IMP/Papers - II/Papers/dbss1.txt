officer D - daughter in law  ie. wife of B

using this you have to solve five questions. that is very easy
if you confirm the above.

ie.  don't confuse with the sentance who learns music. he clearly
mension that daughter in law is offcier. he also mension that A is
brother in law of officer. And C is a doctor.
