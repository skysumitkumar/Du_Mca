Iam really sorry for responding so late.
I wanted to sit with your work but I could not ( because of some problems )
I remember very little about the Dharma test pattern.
There was an Apptitude test. Quantitative and Analytical.
The Quantitative is very easy. You should prepare from GRE or any  CAT
Material.
The Analytical part is mostly from Barrons Guide. I remember two questions .
they are from Barron's guide. It is something about a village called "kaya-kaya
" where half the people speak truth and half lies. There was one more about set
of houses of itallian,germans,romman etc in a row whose chimmney colours were
given, their favoritr drinks were given. I hope you will find these questions
in Barron's guide. I did not get a Barron's guide to search them for you. The
interview was mostly about C , C++ . They are mostly working on C++. That will
help if you know. They are working on their own SQL. You should brush up your
fundas in DBMS. In interview there are questions in UNIX Internals also. Hope
this info is of some use to you. Good Luck. Keep me informed on the proceedings
of the campus.

                  VSAT Overview

                  Why Use VSATs?

                  VSAT networks provide rapid, reliable satellite 
transmission of data, voice, and video to an unlimited number of geographically dispersed
                  sites or from these sites to headquarters.

                  What Equipment Do I Need for My VSAT Network?

                  Each site is equipped with a VSAT terminal consisting 
of an antenna, outdoor electronics mounted on the antenna for signal
                  reception/transmission, and indoor electronics 
for connection to customer computer, telephone, and video equipment.

                             Cost-effective real-time communications 
across town, or across the country.

                             Shared hub services from Hughes Network 
Systems: Making Satellite Technology work for your business.

                             Today, businesses in a wide variety 
of industries are relying on VSAT (very small aperture terminal) 
satellite networks to help them
                             communicate with their remote locations 
no matter where they are  across town, or across the country.

                             Even for businesses with relatively 
small numbers of remote sites, satellite networks can be one of the most
                             cost-effective ways to obtain efficient, on-line communications.

                             The central  the heart of your network.

                             VSAT networks rely on a central hub 
station to serve as the transfer point between the remote locations, the
                             satellite, and company headquarters 
or data center. The hub contains the necessary uplink/downlink equipment to
                             transmit signals to and from the satellite.

                             For many companies, it is not desirable 
or feasible to own and operate their own dedicated hub. The solution: shared hub services from
                             Hughes.Shared Hub Services from Hughes 
give you the efficiency of on-line communications at a cost that agrees with your bottom
                             line.

                             Hughes Network Systems owns and operates 
four full-service satellite hubs located across the country. The hubs operate seven days a
                             week, 24 hours a day. For a reasonable 
monthly fee, you have all the advantages of on-line satellite communications:

                                 Data transmission 
                                 Real-time video 
                                 Audio transmission 
                                 Disaster recovery 
                                 Pilot programs for new networks or applications 

                             Using shared hub services means you 
avoid the expense of building your own hub and maintaining a technical
                             staff to run it. You contract for only 
the amount of satellite bandwidth that you need on satellites built by the
                             world's largest satellite manufacturer. 
And when your network needs to grow or change, you can count on
                             Hughes to reconfigure the network quickly with a minimum of expense.

                             Disaster recovery: being ready for the unexpected.

                             No one likes to think that a disaster 
 either natural or  could hit the network. But in the event of a hub
                             failure, whether it's a shared hub 
or a hub dedicated to one company's operation, Hughes is ready to put you back
                             in business.

                             The Germantown hub provides complete 
backup service in the event of disaster. Hughes can bring your network
                             back up rapidly and will keep it operating 
while hub repairs are underway. As soon as the hub is repaired, we
                             switch you back to normal operation.

                             Let us show you how Hughes Shared Hub 
Services can help you advance the way your business communicates.
