~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Paper -1 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This year COSL has changed the
pattern altogether. Too many questions in just 30 minutes later on they
increased time by 10 min.

              I have generated some of the questions :

It  contains Group A and group B.

group B is pshychometry and try to attempt it only after completing the
group A. unless group A is completed don't try to go for group B since it
will have very less weightage.

In group A again u will have sections like

1.quantitative 

2.Arrange the sentance properly and find the fifth word

3. Figures (visible test)

4. some cartoons will be there. u have to arrange them in proper order so
that u will generate one story.

5. synonoms



group A:

If you attempt them without solving you can solve the other questions so
dont look at these questions there and just mark them blindly.
