Hi
 
Find enclosed question papers of nagarro... there are many questions and some are very tough...  YOU ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO THEM ALL.... AND YOU ARE NOT EXPECTED TO KNOW ALL... all these are off campus papers and level of on campus exam is easier than off campus...
 
this is just to give u an idea of pattern of the question paper.... please do not attempt all questions... and dont get worked up / nervous by looking at them... try some to gain confidence... 31 may is the latest off campus...
 
i dnt have mathematical and reasoning section part... revise trigonometry; mensuration; circles; similar triangles formulae...
 
reasoning is easy... they will give u some facts... and u have to find inferences... some concentration and its done...
 
in interview they will ask u to justify and optimize ur code...
 
tech interview covers C++ (virtuual func; constructor destructors; templates ; polymorphism)
 
dbms : some concepts
 
baaki sab mei deep mei nahi jaatey.... 
 
algo : sorting seraching trees... (sorting and searching mei they will say that solve this in O(n); O(nlgn)...
 
projects : whatever projects u have done.... they wil ask u to explian ur fav... give them a flow diagram on how u did it... then they wil ask u how u implemented a particualr functions... y did u use a particular DS... couldd there be a better DS u cud have used.... 
 
in interview form they ask u to rate on c/c++ : i suggest dont rate urself more than 3.5... rather stick to 3... even if u r confident of ur concepts... u cn always show ur knowledge in the interview... otherwise chances are that they will grill u...
 
ALL THE BEST
 
best things come to those who wait.... so dont loose hope... :)
 
thanks and regards 
Vandita Kapila

Q.1  Given a matrix; u hv to print elements on spiral form

eg.  1 2 3 4
    5 6 7 8
    9 10 11 12
    13 14 15 16

output : 1 2 3 4 8 12 16 15 14 13 9 5 6 7 11 10

Q.2. Print maximum sum subarray of an array which has both positive and negative numbers.

q.3. An list contains n numbers. If a particular number occurs >= n/2 times in the list print the number. else print no such number.

q.4. We were given a grid. If user entered a particular position in the grid function should return the value at that position

the grid was something like

0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 3 6 10 15 21 28 36 45 55
1 . ....
1 .
1 .
1 .
1 .
1
1
1

I dnt remember the entire grid but there was some logic for each element/ row. Using which we had to return the element

hiii

yaar sabse pehle written tha, it was ok.. Aptitude , data analysis, os, data structures, c/c++ , reading comprehension,
and e-mail writing....
c/c++ ke ques to kaafi "test your c skills" and "test ur c++ skills" mein se the.
Reading passage thoda tough tha par ho jayega, apti was fine, thoda set etc aana chahiye.....

Now cuming to tech interview...

enter karte hi, first of all he asked me tell about myself, I started with telling about my schooling, grad and then mca,
hobbies, strenghths.......
then he asked whether i am comfortable with c/c++ , pointers...
i said i am ok with them..
he asked me to allocate some memory and then assign some value to it and then free it
I wrote
int *i ;
i = (int*) malloc(4) ;
*i = 10 ;
free(i) ;

he said it is fine now optimize it
i then used calloc but it was no better.
He asked me why i used free, i said because it allocated from heap...

Then he asked about data structures
delete last node from linked list...

phir came to networks, layers of Tcp/ip
why transport layer is above network layer.

phir asked whether i ahve mobile phone, i said yes, then he asked about mobile communication , i.e. its working..

then operating systems, he asked me to tell everyting i know about os, i started with its definition , then its main
functions, he then asked in detail about process management... i told swapping, schedulars, jo bhi mujhe aata tha,
sab bol diya, various stages of process...

phir he asked whether i am comfortable with software eng, i said i like the sub, then he asked about software development
life cycle...

he asked me to implement free, on which i said that i dont know this, on which he repleied that i have to answer something,
work cant go like this, so i answered something, which i thing was ok , because he appreciated my answer, even though i
knew nothing about it.

in sub ques ke beech mein wo mujhse hr ke bhi ques pooch raha tha,
which was the last movie u saw, when was the last table tennis match u played...

finally he askeed me to implement queue using two stacks....


Now naggaro ques.

Offcampus diya tha
first round was tech wriiten, 4 code karne the
1. to find in a given string letter which has maximum occurance
2. To implement 8 queen problem
3. To check the status of sudoku,at any stage during the game
4. Permutation of a word

second round was apti wriiten

bahaut sare trigo aur geomety ke ques the, aur data analysis ke ques the

phir third round was interview

first ques was tell about yourself
phir he asked abt object oriented concepts
inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, abstraction, data hiding

phir came to virtual functions, friend functions, friend classes, which operators cant be overloaded...
order in which constructors are called, order in which destructors are called...
then some ques related to c++

then came to ds

1.what are  BST
 2. code to merge 2 bst,
3.  then to find the position where two linked list merge,
4. to delete a node having two children from bst,
5.  then what is graph
6. kruskal algo
7. prim
8. safe edges
9. dfs and bfs

then he came to dbms

concurrent queries, nested queries, he gave a query to write, outer join....

then os, context switch..

main thing is that u must answer everything with confidance ang dont get nervous...  try to give ur best....

All the best...
