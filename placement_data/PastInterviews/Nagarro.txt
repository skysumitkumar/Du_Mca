Hi
 
Find enclosed question papers of nagarro... there are many questions and some are very tough...  YOU ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO THEM ALL.... AND YOU ARE NOT EXPECTED TO KNOW ALL... all these are off campus papers and level of on campus exam is easier than off campus...
 
this is just to give u an idea of pattern of the question paper.... please do not attempt all questions... and dont get worked up / nervous by looking at them... try some to gain confidence... 31 may is the latest off campus...
 
i dnt have mathematical and reasoning section part... revise trigonometry; mensuration; circles; similar triangles formulae...
 
reasoning is easy... they will give u some facts... and u have to find inferences... some concentration and its done...
 
in interview they will ask u to justify and optimize ur code...
 
tech interview covers C++ (virtuual func; constructor destructors; templates ; polymorphism)
 
dbms : some concepts
 
baaki sab mei deep mei nahi jaatey.... 
 
algo : sorting seraching trees... (sorting and searching mei they will say that solve this in O(n); O(nlgn)...
 
projects : whatever projects u have done.... they wil ask u to explian ur fav... give them a flow diagram on how u did it... then they wil ask u how u implemented a particualr functions... y did u use a particular DS... couldd there be a better DS u cud have used.... 
 
in interview form they ask u to rate on c/c++ : i suggest dont rate urself more than 3.5... rather stick to 3... even if u r confident of ur concepts... u cn always show ur knowledge in the interview... otherwise chances are that they will grill u...
 
ALL THE BEST
 
best things come to those who wait.... so dont loose hope... :)
 
thanks and regards
