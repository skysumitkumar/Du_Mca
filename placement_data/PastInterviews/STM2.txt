All of this paper had different no of questions...

I had given paper of embedded software so I am giving its details .Paper  had two part:

1. 1 marks questions (10 questions of aptitude and 10 questions on OS, Microprocessor and DS)

2.2 marks questions on C(15 questions)

 

 

Part 1: 1 marks questions were like...(Aptitude was quite easy)

 3 questions on H/w ..that I could not solve…. 
1 question on Boolean expression(a simple one)
 

         2 marks questions…

   1 #define xyz abc*cd 

          #define abc  10

         #define cd 10

        Main()

     {

           Int k;

           K=20-xyz;

            K==?

      }

           Ans:  -80

 

2.  Static variables don't change their value as they are stored in

a) stack   b)  data segment   c)  heap  d) none

 

3. #pragma  pack(1)

Int a:4;

Int b:45;

Char c;

}

 What is the size of struct if int is of four bytes .

Ans is   5 

4. a question on bitwise  operator 

 5.int i=90;

Char *p;

P=(char *)&i ;

P++;

   Pointer is I ncremented  by  2,1,4  or none of these

 

6.#define scanf "%s is string"

Main()

{

Printf(scanf,scanf);

 

Ans;   %s is string is string

 

 

7 char str={"neha");

printf("hello \n" %s" \n",str);

 

output  :  ?

 

 

8 One question on page table. we had to find page size

         (3*4096 + 16*1024+ 3)

11.    1  question  on recursion

 int i=89;

      Int *p;

Char *t;

P=&I;

T=(char *)&I;

If( *p==*t)

Printf("yes");

Else 

Printf("no");

Tell the  o/p.

 

12. Again 2 question to find output of a c program
