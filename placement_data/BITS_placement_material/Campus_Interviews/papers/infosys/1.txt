  this type see in the new edition rs agerwal a box is their in the ans
  so try for qus in rs agerwal
  see rs agerwal for statements and assumptions qus.
  cut off will be around 30 out of 105 Bso place only the known problems
  so
  place only correct problems.
  the above 35 qus are enough to qualify
