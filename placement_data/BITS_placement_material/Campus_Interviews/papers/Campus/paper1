PART 1

1). A beggr collects cigarette stubs and makes one ful  cigarette

can he smoke totally.
                     Ans. 8
2). A soldiar looses his way in a thick jungle  at  random  walks 
from his camp but  mathematically  in  an  interestingg  fashion.  
First he walks one mile east then half mile to north.   Then  1/4 
mile to west, then 1/8 mile to south and so  on  making  a  loop. 
Finally hoe far he is from his camp and in which direction.
ans: in north and south directions 
   1/2 - 1/8 + 1/32 - 1/128 + 1/512 - and so on 
                = 1/2/((1-(-1/4))
      similarly in east and west directions
     1- 1/4 + 1/16 - 1/64 + 1/256 -    and so on 
             = 1/(( 1- ( - 1/4))
   add both the answers
3). hoe 1000000000 can be written as a  product  of  two  factors 
neither of them containing zeros

4). Conversation between two mathematcians:
  first : I have three childern. Thew pproduct of their ages is  36 
.  If you sum their ages . it is exactly same as  my  neighbour's 
door number on my left. The  sacond  mathematiciaan  verfies  the 
door number and says that the not sufficient  .  Then  the  first 
says " o.k one more clue is that my youngest is the youngest"
Immmediately the second mathematician answers . Can  you  aanswer 
the questoion asked by the first mathematician?

red balls and others contain only blue . One sales man  sold  one 
box out of them and then he says " I have the same number of  red 
balls left out  as that of blue ". Which box is the one he  solds 
out  ?
Ans : total no of balls  =  89 and (89-29 /2 = 60/2 = 30 
     and also 14 + 16 = 5 + 7 + 18 = 30

1) There are two balls touching each other circumferencically.
The radius of the big ball is 4 times the diameter of the small
ball.The outer small ball rotates in anticlockwise direction
circumferencically over the bigger one at the rate of 16 rev/sec.
The bigger wheel also rotates anticlockwise at Nrev/sec. what is
'N' for the horizontal line from the centre of small wheel always
is horizontal.

 Q)  Strike off any digit from each number in seven rows (need not
 be at same place) and combine the same operations with 3 digit numbers
 to get the same addition. After this strike off another digit from all
 and add all the No.s to get the same 2 digit No. perform the same
 process again with 1 digit No.s. Give the ' no.s in 7 rows at
 each stage.

3) there is a safe with a 5 digit No. The 4th digit is 4 greater than
second digit, while 3rd digit is 3 less than 2nd digit. The 1st digit
is thrice the last digit. There are 3 pairs whose sum is 11. Find
the number.  Ans) 65292.

4) there are 2 guards Bal and Pal walking on the side of a wall of a
wearhouse(12m X 11m) in opposite directions. They meet at a point and
Bal says to Pal " See you again in the other side". After a few moments
of walking Bal decides to go back for a smoke but he changes his 
direction again to his previous one after 10 minutes of walking in
the other(opposite) direction remembering that Pal will be waiting
for to meet.If Bal and Pal walk 8 and 11 feet respectively, how
much distance they would have travelled before meeting again.

        *********************************************
                   NOVEL  NETWORK PAPER
        *********************************************

The paper consists os three sections.
1. aptitude 15 questions 20 min.
2. system concepts 20 questions 20 min.
3. 'c'   15 questions 20 min.

NOTE:::::

I'm sendin the questions, somany have no answers. U do check the
answers  for all the given questions also.

All questions are MULTIPLE CHOICES ONLY.

U do try to cover the related topics to get some understanding.
In interview They are asking C C++ Operating system concepts
and Networks.
They will ask about Ur interesting subjects, U try to have good
grip on those intresting subjects.

They selected 11 out of 55 students.
 They asked about c c++ project work and OS,NETWORKS.
But they selected only 2 , one from CS and another is BTech ECE.


SECTION 1 is main factor selection to the interview


--------------------------------------------------------------
In the interveiw you should be very active .And should be frank to say 
no also.One CS student said that he don't know NETWORK and he hasn't 
taken NETWORKS subject.But he has selected.
      OK  BEST OF LUCK.


section 1::::;

*. GRE book test paper 3 section 5
question no. 8 to 12     (ships WXYZ starting on dec. 23rd..........)


* 5 programs are sheduled from monday to saterday, monday is not holiday,
PQRST are the programs. The day before P is holiday, and some other clues are
given, we have to find the sequence (4 questions)

ANS: tuesday is the holiday
     P comes on wednesday ,
     U can do the remaining very easily.
* Suppose U R the presoner, There are two guards Who will tell truth or
one will tell truth. There is a gate for liberty and another foe hell.

Some questions are given, like
    i. are U tell truth?
    ii. another tell truth or not??
    iii. both of U R telling truth??
    iV. both of U lieing??
    V. --------------


    they gave  a. b. c. d. and asking about which sequencing is sufficient to
    find the gate for liberty??
    ( I can't give exact thing)
 
* There are WIFE and HUSBAND at one side of river. They have one child,
They want to cross the river. The child can't be lonly. The boat boy won't
permit morethan one to cross the river, what is the correct way to
cross the river??

* There are 7  targets, A B and C has to shoot them. All should be shooted 
consicutively.
    1. The no. of chances for A and B are not less thn 2,
    2. for C there is only one chance.
    3. A can't shot 3 times consicutively.
    4. B is permited to shoot in even chances only.

    They have given some 3or 4 questions on this

* 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
section 3::

1.Max value of SIGNED int 
    a. b. c. d.
2.One questin is given, long one, to find the answer U should be 
femiliar
 with the operation as follows

 int *num={10,1,5,22,90};
 main()
 {
 int *p,*q;
  int i;
  p=num;
  q=num+2;
  i=*p++;
  print the value of i, and q-p, and some other operations are there.
  }
  how the values will change??
3. One pointer diff is given like this:
  int *(*p[10])(char *, char*)
  asked to find the    meaning.
4. char *a[4]={"jaya","mahe","chandra","buchi"};
   what is the value of    sizeof(a)/sizeof(char *)
   a. 4 b.bytes for char c-- d.--
( we don't know the answer)

5. void fn(int *a, int *b)
   {
    int *t;
    t=a;
    a=b;
    b=t;
    }
    main()
    {
     int a=2;
     int b=3;
     fn(&a,&b);
     print the values os a and b;
     }
     what is the output--- out put won't swap, the same values remain.

     a. error at runtime
     b. compilation error
     c.2 3
     d. 3 2
6. 
#define scanf "%s is a string"
main()
{
 printf(scanf,scanf);
 }
 what is the output.

 ANS : %s is string is string

7. i=2+3,4>3,1;
   printf("%d"i);

   ans is 5 only.
8. char *p="abc";
   char *q="abc123";

   while(*p=*q)
   {
    print("%c %c",*p,*q);
    }

    a. aabbcc
    b. aabbcc123
    c. abcabc123
    d. infinate loop ( this may be correct)
9. printf("%u",-1)
what is the value?
a. -1 b. 1 c. 65336 d.  --


(maxint value-1   I think, check for the answer)

10. #define void int
    int i=300;
   void  main(void)
    {
     int i=200;
     {
      int i=100;
      print the value of i;
      }
      print the value of i
      }
      what is the output?


      may be 100 200
11.

   int x=2;
   x=x<<2;
   printf("%d ",x);


   ANS=8;
12.
     
int a[]={0,0X4,4,9};     /*some values are given*/

int i=2;

printf("%d %d",a[i],i[a]);

 what is the value???   (may be error)

 13.
     some other program is given , I can't remember it
     U can get it afterwads,

     the answer is 3 3, so U can check this in the exam. itself.

     I'll send the remaining two afterwars whenever I get them. OK !
