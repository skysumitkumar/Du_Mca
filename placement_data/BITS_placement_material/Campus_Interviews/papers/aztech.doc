\par Questions on C++ are asked here
\par 
\par {\*\bkmkstart OLE_LINK1}Base class has some virtual method and derived 
\par class has a method with the same name. If we initialize the base class pointer with derived 
\par object,.calling of that virtual method will result in which method being called? 
\par a. Base method 
\par b. Derived method..
\par }{\cf12 Ans. b}{
\par Almost all questions are of this kind. Go through virtual functions concepts in C++ and how the pointers to functions would be handled.
