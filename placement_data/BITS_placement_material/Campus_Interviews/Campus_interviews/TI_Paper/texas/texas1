texas instruments paper .
in this paper there was 20 questions as follows in 60
minutes .
second part consists of 36 que. in 30 minutes all
questions are
diagramatical.(figurs).. 
1. if a 5-stage pipe-line is flushed and then we have
to execute 5 and 12
instructions respectively then no. of  cycles will
bea. 5 and 12b. 6 and 13
c. 9 and 16d.none 2. k-mapab----------c	1   x  0  0	1 
 x  0  xsolve it a. A.B
B. ~AC. ~BD. A+B3.CHAR  A[10][15] AND INT B[10][15] IS
DEFINED
WHAT'S THE ADDRESS OF A[3][4] AND B[3][4]
IF ADDRESS OD A IS OX1000 AND B IS 0X2000A. 0X1030 AND
0X20C3
B. OX1031 AND OX20C4AND SOME OTHERS..4. int f(int *a){
int b=5;a=&b;}main(){
int i;printf("\n %d",i);f(&i);printf("\n
%d",i);}what's the output .1.10,5
2,10,10c.5,5d. none5. main(){int
i;fork();fork();fork();printf("----");}
how many times the printf will be executed .a.3 b.
6c.5d. 86. void f(int i){
int j;for (j=0;j<16;j++){if (i &
(0x8000>>j))printf("1");elseprintf("0");}}
what's the purpose of the program a. its output is hex
representation of ib. bcd
c. binaryd. decimal 7.#define f(a,b) a+b#define g(a,b)
a*bmain(){int m;
m=2*f(3,g(4,5));printf("\n m is %d",m);}what's the
value of ma.70b.50c.26d. 698.
main(){char a[10];strcpy(a,"\0");if
(a==NULL)printf("\a is null");else
printf("\n a is not null");}what happens with it .a.
compile time error.
b. run-time error.c. a is  nulld. a is not  null.9.
char a[5]="hello"
a. in array we can't do the operation .b. size of a is
too large
c. size of a is too smalld. nothing wrong with it .
10. local variables can be store by compilera. in
register or heap
b. in register or stackc .in stack or heap .d. global
memory.
11. average and worst time complexity in a sorted
binary tree is
12. a tree is given and ask to find its meaning
(parse-tree)  (expression tree)
ans. ((a+b)-(c*d))  ( not confirmed)13. convert
40.xxxx into binary .
14. global variable conflicts due to multiple file
occurance is resolved during 
a. compile-timeb. run-time c. link-timed. load-time15.

two program is given of factorial.
one  with  recursion and one without recursion .
question was which program won't run for very big no.
input because of
stack overfow .a. i only  (ans.)b. ii onlyc. i& ii
both .c. none 16. struct a{
int a;char b;int c;}union b{char a;int b;int c;};which
is correct .
a. size of a is always diff. form size of b.(ans.)
b. size of a is always same  form size of b.
c. we can't say anything because of not-homogeneous
(not in ordered)
d. size of a can be same if ...
