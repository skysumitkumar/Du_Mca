<P>Technical Questions in the second round --</P>
<P>---------------------------------------</P>

<P>[1] What are the current trends and areas of focus in IT.</P>
<P>My Ans. Talked about emerging trends of S/W Engg and ISO 9000 stuff</P>
<P>(gave vague ideas about them as I don't know much nor do I care </P>
<P>about these topics myself ;-)). Then mentioned the proliferation of O-O</P>
<P>methodologies and their usefulness in speeding up development process,</P>
<P>code re-usability, ease of maintenance, ease of bug-fixing.</P>
<P>Thirdly, mentioned the work going on in High-Speed N/w - FDDI, ATM,</P>
<P>Fast-Ethernet(100Mbps). Told whatever little I knew about ATM in</P>
<P>response to another question.</P>

<P>[2] What is a Micro-Kernel architecture.</P>
<P>My Ans. This is a developing area in OSs where  instead of building the</P>
<P>kernel as a single monolithic structure starting from scratch, it is</P>
<P>built as a set of layers. The micro-kernel provides only the bare-bones</P>
<P>like Device-drivers, rudimentary filesystem support etc. on which,</P>
<P>depending on the intended area of application of the OS, it can be</P>
<P>customized to provide various higher level OS features like</P>
<P>Multiprocessing, IPC, etc. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>  a) Describe the memory management policies in Unix. How is paging</P>
<P>      implemented? How page faults are handled? </P>
<P>      Seems to be a favorite question for these chaps ---- Maurice Bach. </P>
<P>   </P>
<P>   b) Write a macro in C for swapping two nibbles in a byte.</P>
<P>      -Use the shift operators and be careful while defining temporary </P>
<P>      variables( if you do so) as you have to write a macro. Otherwise</P>
<P>      it is pretty simple.</P>

<P>   c) What is the CPU-scheduling policy in Unix? - Round robin scheduling</P>
<P>      with multilevel queues.</P>

<P>   d) Diffrence between short term, long term and medium term scheduler.</P>
<P>      -First two should be peaceful. The last one is also known as </P>
<P>       swapper. (See Taenenbaum and/or Peterson)</P>

<P>   e) Name various page-replacement policies. Which can be implemented</P>
<P>      both with and without pre-emption? - see Peterson.</P>

<P>   f) Describe the Sliding window protocol. What is it's advantage</P>
<P>      over stop-and-wait? - Saves bandwidth. (Taenenbaum please)</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>   2ND INTERVIEW (Both personal and technical interleaved)</P>
<P>   a) Tell us something about yourself.</P>
<P>   b) Aren't you going for higher studies abroad? Why?</P>
<P>   c) Rank and CGPA. MSites do not have ranks but still they wanted to</P>
<P>      know my approx position in my batch. </P>
<P>      - Shady question. It is your job to convince them that for</P>
<P>      MS, grades do not hold any meaning.</P>

<P>   d) What is re-entrant code? --- Non-self modifying code. Can be </P>
<P>      shared by many processes simultaneously. Gave e.g. of text-editors</P>
<P>      like 'vi'.</P>
<P>      Counter Q: But then no code modifies itself. What does 'non-self </P>
<P>      modifying' mean? ---- I don't know for sure.</P>

<P>   e) Diff between compilers and interpreters. Some fundaes about</P>
<P>      how to link code in  different files. </P>

<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;a)question</P>
<P>&#9;my weakness, kinds of friendship, family details</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;b) response</P>
<P>&#9;They are impressed if one presents papers.</P>
<P>&#9; I have presented conference papers</P>
<P>&#9;in the national level.</P>

<P>Generally most of the companies asks about the project.</P>
<P>Regarding other technical questions, they put questions</P>
<P>on the courses I did.</P>

<P>B) Personal</P>
<P>-----------</P>

<P>i) Tell us something about yourself. (This has to be there)</P>
<P>ii) Strengths and weaknesses (This question also disguised in various </P>
<P>   forms is always asked).</P>
<P>iii) Why should we hire you?</P>
<P>iv) Can you describe your project in short?</P>
<P>v) Why did you take 2-1/2 years to complete (My case!)</P>
<P>vi) If given the job when can you join. (Caution: Don't think that if </P>
<P>    you give some unreal early deadlines they will offer you the job.</P>
<P>    Always play safe and give a deadline by which time you are sure to </P>
<P>    complete and join. Asking for extensions is the worst scenario). </P>

<P>Tips: Be confident, frank (But need not give away information which may weigh</P>
<P>      against your case), free (use first names while addresing them, so be</P>
<P>      alert when they introduce themselves) and cheerful (attend an interview</P>
<P>      with a positive frame of mind). Remember you are IITians and you always</P>
<P>      have an edge. That may sound arrogant, but its true. </P>
