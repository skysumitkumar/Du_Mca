<P>     HONEYWELL </P>

<P>Honeywell conducted a test in IIT and Interview was in their</P>
<P>office at B'lore.</P>

<P>Test contained 100 multiple choice questions divided into</P>

<P>Still a lot of questions from software engineering .</P>
<P>Which are the different phases in Software life cycle (asked again)</P>
<P>Why is analysis and testing phases very important ?</P>
<P>Which methodologies are U familiar with ?</P>

<P>Have U worked in windows ? (Yes)</P>
<P>What is the difference U have seen from a Dos environment ?</P>
<P>I said it event driven .</P>
<P>So what do U mean by event driven ?</P>
<P>How do WinMain look like ?</P>
<P>How the messages are processed in Windows ?</P>
<P>(Queue of events)</P>
<P>What are parameters needed to distinguish an event ?</P>

<P>Have U done any network programming ?</P>
<P>Why networks are layered ?</P>
<P>What is the advantage of that ?</P>

<P>Which one is costly - ethernet of ring networks ?</P>

<P>Some questions form OOSD and Digital signal processing.</P>
<P>What is inheritance, encapsulation etc.</P>

<P>How do  U interact with friends ?</P>
<P>How do adjust to a new environemnt ?</P>
<P>Suppose U solve a problem and after that U are getting an almost same</P>
<P>problem with high complexity ( and lower complexity). How will U</P>
<P>approach to the next problem. </P>
<P>What is U'r approach towards a new subject ?</P>
<P>How do U prepare for exams ?</P>
<P>Suppose in a project meeting, somebody fires U, how will U react ?</P>
<P>Are U patient enought to wait in long queues ?</P>
<P>Still some more which I don't rememebr.....</P>

<P>VERIFONE</P>

<P>Verifone test Questions :</P>

<P>There are two parts :</P>
<P>Note: The Answers given here are what i wrote, May not be correct.</P>

<P>1. Aptitute test &#9;:  15 Minutes, 20 Questions</P>

<P>&#9;Towards the middle questions are easy than from the front.</P>

<P>&#9;eg.  Product of three consecutive nos. 210.  What is the sum</P>
<P>&#9;   &#9;of two least numbers?</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;ans.: 5 * 6 * 7 = 210 , sum = 11 is answer</P>

<P>&#9;eg.  If the area of the sqaure is increased by 69 % how</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;much the length of the side will increase?</P>

<P>&#9;&#9;  ans.: 13 (i think)</P>
<P>&#9;eg.  if the sum of five consecutive nos. 35? how many prime nos</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;are there :</P>
<P>&#9;&#9; </P>
<P>&#9;&#9;ans: 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 35  so two primes</P>

<P>&#9;eg.  if the length of the rectangle is reduced by 20% and breath</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;is increased by 20 % what is the net change ?</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;ans.: 4 % decrease</P>

<P>2. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>i. Electrical &amp; Electronics  &#9;: 15 Questions</P>
<P>&#9;and,nand...circuit realted stuff,  ..........</P>

<P>ii.Data Structures, Algo., &amp; Complexity theory : 5 questions</P>

<P>a. if W is a sequence of strings without a and W' is its reversal</P>
<P>&#9;then WaW' is generated by:</P>

<P>&#9;&#9;ans. i think Context Free Grammmars</P>

<P>b. Whether all recusive pgm can be writtten iteratively?</P>

<P>c. What data structes you will use if you want to go to first record from</P>
<P>the last and vice versa?  </P>
<P>&#9;ans.: doubly linked circular list</P>

<P>d. Given 10000 nos. and 48MB Memory.  What is the complexity of the </P>
<P>efficient sorting algo.? (the algo. is not mentioned)</P>

<P>e.  Given a  C code and ask what it does?</P>
<P>&#9;I think the code was something similar to Bubble sort and that</P>
<P>particular code does the sorting in Desending order and the complexity</P>
<P>is O(n^2)(which is the next question).</P>

<P>iii. OS : 5 questions</P>

<P>a. If there are too many page faults what is the problem?</P>

<P>b. To ensure one pgm. doesnt corrupt other pgm. in a Multi-pgm. enviornment</P>
<P>&#9;what you should do?</P>

<P>c. Which one you will use  to implement critical section?</P>
<P>&#9;Binary Semaphore</P>

<P>d. Which one is not needed for Multi-pgm. enviornment?</P>
<P>&#9;options are: virtual memory,security,time sharing,none of the</P>
<P>     &#9;&#9;&#9;above.&#9;</P>
<P>&#9;</P>

<P>iv. Networks and Hardware:  5 questions</P>

<P>a. Which one is not done by Data link layer ?</P>
<P>&#9;bit stuffing, LRC,CRC,parity check </P>
<P>&#9;</P>
<P>b. Which one is not related to Data link layer?</P>

<P>c. Which one is not suitable for client-server application?</P>
<P>&#9;tcp/ip,message passing,rpc,none of the above.</P>

<P>d.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>v. Databases and Misc.: 5 questions</P>

<P>a. What SQL .................. (not the expansion)</P>

<P>b. Indexing in databases give you ............</P>

<P>c.  </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>vi. C Pgm. : 5 questions</P>

<P>1. int a=1,b=2,c=3;</P>
<P>   printf("%d,%d",a,b,c);</P>
<P>&#9;What is the output?</P>

<P>2. for(i=0; i&lt;=10;i++,printf("%d",i); +-   (+- is there in the questions)</P>

<P>3. Scope of Static Variable ............</P>

<P>4. Given a C code and what is the output?</P>
