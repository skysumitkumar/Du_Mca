<p align="left"><strong>This is only a sample paper. We are not providing you with all the
questions - just some questions to give you a general idea of the test pattern.</strong></p>

<p align="left"><br>
<strong>SECTION I </strong>- <em>8 questions based on series.</em><br>
<br>
1. These questions involve interchange of letters in a word at particular locations and
also interchanging letters adjacent to those particular locations.Certain other conditions
may also be given<br>
For eg.<br>
Let the word be ABBAABA<br>
If we apply 25 on this, it means we have to interchange the letters at positions 2 and 5,
also we have to change the letters adjacent to positions 2 and 5 i.e.from A to B and B to
A. <br>
A B B A A B after Step 1 i.e interchange of 2 and 5 becomes AABABB<br>
Now change adjacent elements of 2 and 5...finally answer becomes<br>
Ans: B A A B B A<br>
<br>
<em>Questions 1-5 are based on the pattern with changed numbers as described above</em></p>

<p align="left"><em>Questions 6-8 are of the following type</em></p>

<p align="left">To get AAABBD from BBBAAA what number should be applied:-<br>
a) 25 <br>
b) 34 <br>
c) 25 &amp; 34 <br>
d) none</p>

<p align="left"><br>
<strong>SECTION II<br>
</strong><br>
1. Given the following functions<br>
(1) f(n a b c ) = ac if n=1<br>
(2) f(n a b c) = f( n-1 a c b) + f( 1 a b c) + f( n-1 b a c ) if n &gt; 1<br>
&nbsp; <br>
Then what is the value&nbsp;&nbsp; f( 2 a b c ) = ?<br>
<br>
<font color="#800000">Ans: f( 2 a c b ) = ab + ac + bc</font>.</p>

<p align="left"><br>
2. Similar question on functions.</p>

<p align="left"><br>
3. <em>[ Based on the function in the first question]</em> For the function f( 4 a b c )
the number of terms is...?<br>
<em>Hint</em> f( 4 a b c ) = f( 3 a c b ) + f( 1 a b c ) + f( 3 b a c ) etc.<br>
<br>
<br>
4. What is the value of the function&nbsp; f( 5 a b c ) = ?</p>

<p align="left"><br>
<strong>SECTION III</strong><br>
<br>
Permutations and Combinations.<br>
8 Questions.<br>
<br>
1. r = number of flags;n = number of poles;<br>
Any number of flags can be accommodated on any single pole.<br>
<br>
1) r=5,n=5 The no. of ways the flags can be arranged ?<br>
<br>
Questions 2-5 are based on the above pattern</p>

<p align="left"><br>
6. r = 5 n = 3 . If first pole has 2 flags, third pole has 1 flag<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How many ways can the remaining be arranged?<br>
<br>
Questions 7.&amp; 8. are similar to Question 6.</p>

<p align="left"><br>
<strong>SECTION IV</strong><br>
<em>Question consisting of figures - Pattern-matching type.</em></p>

<p align="left">Refer R.S Agarwal's book on Analytical Reasoning &amp; TMHs Quantitative
ability book by Edgar Thorpe.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>SECTION V</strong><br>

from the choice given:<br>
