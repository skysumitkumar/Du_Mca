In these devices, the power 		source is usually a lightweight battery, and the need to fit into a pocket or 		briefcase dictates limits on size. Although these power constraints are more 		rigorous than for a system that relies on power from a wall plug, the power is 		still relatively plentiful. After all, users can recharge that iPod or cell 		phone every night.</p>     <p>What if users could never recharge&#8212;or even replace&#8212;the 		system battery? This scenario faces designers of systems deployed in a remote 		field installation where replenishing the battery is not an option. A 		wireless-sensor network, often called a smart-sensor, or dust, network, is one 		such application: The average current consumption of each independent node is 		around 1 &#181;A.</p>     <BR>Less exotic consumer applications can 
also face severe power constraints. One example is the common home thermostat. 
Designing it so that users can replace the battery adds both a layer of 
complexity to the homeowner's instruction manual and the expense of the added 
ruggedness and access ports on the case, so thermostats are often sealed units. 
Juan Alvarez, Texas Instruments' MSP430 marketing manager, explains the 
straightforward calculation of a thermostat's energy budget: "A small 
lithium-ion battery has about 220 mA-hours. If you achieve an average system 
current consumption of 2.5 &#181;A, that works out to about 10 years of battery 
life." At the end of 10 years, the homeowner replaces the thermostat rather than 
replacing the battery.<BR>     <p><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0" align="right" valign="top" id="boombox" style="background-color:#DDE6ED;padding:19px;">

The prime characteristic of a system that can operate on the order of 1 		&#181;A of average current is low duty cycle. Such systems are asleep for 		more than 99% of their life with brief intervals of activity when they wake up, 		poll their sensors, process and communicate sensor measurements, and then 		return to a sleep state. When designing for such low-duty-cycle, ultralow-power 		systems, designers have two main areas with decidedly different characteristics 		in which to conserve power: digital communication and processing and 		sensor-amplifier and interface circuitry.</p>     <p>Communication takes a significant amount of the power budget for a 		wireless-sensor network. Developers designed most popular wireless protocols 		for systems having relatively unlimited power. For example, a protocol such as 		802.11, with its always-on listening mode, is impractical for a low-duty-cycle 		network. Sokwoo Rhee, chief technology officer at wireless-sensor-network 		designer Millennial Net, says that the company considered other 		wireless-network protocols, such as Zigbee, but found that the communication 		required too much power. Millennial Net instead created its own protocol for 		wireless-sensor networks. Says Rhee, "We had to minimize the number of control 		packets sent back and forth to keep track of the topology. A wireless-sensor 		network needs to minimize overhead and be really efficient at discovering and 		rediscovering the network. You're saving power because you're not running a 		microprocessor for all this [inefficient-network] overhead." </p>     <p>It was worth the effort to create a new protocol, because a ripple 		effect occurs beyond just the savings of microprocessor time and attendant 		power. According to Rhee, the company tried to keep the code footprint small. 		Protocols such as Zigbee have footprints that are more than double the size of 		Millennial Net's proprietary footprint. The protocol fits into a small memory 		space, so it uses a smaller microprocessor, which draws less power and allows 		the company to meet its power-conservation goals. The company selected 		Microchip's PIC16/8LF controller chip for its power efficiency. Future 		processors in low-duty-cycle, ultralow-power designs may take advantage of 		low-threshold-design techniques (see <strong><A href="#Subthresholddesignholdslow-powerpromise">sidebar</A></strong> 		"Subthreshold design holds low-power promise").</p>     <a name="Tripped up?"><strong>Tripped up?</strong></a>     <p>Surprisingly, it's sometimes unnecessary to select a power-optimized 		system processor for low-power designs. Eli Weinstein, chief technology officer 		of AvalonRF, another wireless-sensor-network manufacturer, also points to the 		low duty cycle as being key in allowing ultralow-power requirements. But 		AvalonRF's system processor must be powerful enough to handle capturing, 		processing, and transmitting a snapshot that a node takes. A sample application 		for the device is monitoring secure but remote installations, such as a 		reservoir or a power station. The system must be able to function for as long 		as 10 years, running off a primary lithium battery. If a sensor trips, the 		device wakes up, captures, processes, and transmits an image to a 		decision-maker who determines what triggered the event.</p>     <p>Weinstein says that, although Analog Devices' 32-bit Blackfin 		microcontroller is not what most would classify as a low-power processor, 		AvalonRF designers use a Blackfin ADF 7020 operating with a duty cycle so low 		that the average current drain can be less than 1 &#181;A. "If you turn off 		the clock on the Blackfin, it's very low-power," says Weinstein. It's important 		for low-duty-cycle operation that the processor can stop the clock in 		power-saving mode and then instantly respond; some processors must go through a 		lengthy, power-consuming restart procedure.</p>     <p>The sensor-to-processor circuitry for these ultralow-power, 		low-duty-cycle systems must likewise be low-power. The goal is to select an 		amplifier that has just enough performance to meet the system's 		signal-processing needs and requires the lowest power for that level of 		performance. The op-amp parameters that especially influence power consumption 		are noise performance, slew rate, and output-current drive. In addition, 		although less critical, bias current and supply-voltage droop also have an 		impact.</p>     <p>Unfortunately, low-power-consumption amplifiers have higher noise 		specifications than standard op amps. Tim Regan, signal-processing-applications 		manager for Linear Technology, explains how design constraints exacerbate the 		devices' noise problem: "When you starve all the amplifier's transistors for 		current, you usually have to include very large [internal] resistors on the 		order of 2 to 3 M&#937;. Designers of ultralow-power systems have to 		accommodate that. Large resistors mean significant thermal noise."</p>     <p>For example, a standard op amp might have a noise voltage 
of 10 nV/<IMG

drawing in the milliamp range. Compare this figure with the LT1494/5/6

src="HZ_sqroot.gif" tppabs="http://a330.g.akamai.net/7/330/2540/20050523192945/www.edn.com/articles/images/EDN/20050526/HZ_sqroot.gif">             		             		           		        , significantly 		higher.</p>     <p>To accommodate the inescapably higher noise of low-power op amps, system 		designers must often add filtering. When designing for normal power 		consumption, designers usually try to avoid filtering because of the added 		delay, but in ultralow-power designs, time effectively slows down: A by-product 		of running the amplifier at such low current is that there isn't much current 		available to charge the amplifier's internal capacitances; only nanoamps are 		available to move an op amp's internal nodes. Thus, low-power op amps have low 		slew rates, measured in millivolts per second rather than volts per second. "As 		a low-duty-cycle-system designer," says Regan, "the one attribute you have to 		have is patience, because everything is moving slowly. But, on the other hand, 		this allows you the time to filter because you're not going to get much 		bandwidth out of your system anyway. So go ahead and filter out that noise. It 		kind of eases the pain of the higher noise design." </p>     <p>The need to amplify the sensor signal depends on its voltage level. Says 		Eric Nolan, product-marketing manager for Analog Devices, "Typically, if you're 		in the hundreds-of-millivolts-to-volts range at the sensor you might need only 		to buffer the signal before it goes into a converter. To minimize power 		consumption you want to use higher value resistors so that you eliminate 		additional dc current paths." Plus, he adds, "If you're just doing buffering, 		you can probably get away with using a noninverting-unity-gain configuration; 		you tie the output feedback directly to the inverting-amplifier pin. In that 		case, you're not driving any resistive loads with the amplifier, other than 		what comes off the output that you're driving."</p>     <p>If the sensor-output voltage is in the low-millivolts-to-microvolts 		range, it requires some amplification. The best way to amplify the signal, 		suggests Linear Technology's Regan, is to do the gain in multiple stages and do 		all the filtering in the first stage (<strong><A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.edn.com/contents/images/601827f1.pdf  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.edn.com/contents/images/601827f1.pdf'" tppabs="http://www.edn.com/contents/images/601827f1.pdf">Figure  1</A></strong>). "When you add filter capacitors, if you have large voltage-swing 		changes, you have to charge and discharge those external capacitors that are 		doing your filtering. So, if you can put the filtering in the first stage when 		... just a few microvolts are coming in, you're not going to waste current in 		charging and discharging filter capacitors. You can follow that filter stage 		with conventional resistive-gain stages."</p>     <p>In these low-duty-cycle systems, the op amps spend most of their time 		doing nothing, so it's worthwhile to minimize their doing-nothing current 		drain. For many standard op amps, you can find out their no-load current in 		their quiescent-current specification, which is the current the device requires 		when it isn't under load. However, op amps targeted for low-duty-cycle 		operation can have a shutdown pin, which forces the op amp into an even lower 		current mode. The savings in current is significant: A typical specification 		for quiescent current is 1 &#181;A, whereas shutdown current is about 0.01 		&#181;A. </p>     <a name="Shutdown options exist"><strong>Shutdown options exist</strong></a>     <p>TI's Alvarez suggests considering op amps with this feature (<strong><A  href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.edn.com/contents/images/601827f2.pdf  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.edn.com/contents/images/601827f2.pdf'" tppabs="http://www.edn.com/contents/images/601827f2.pdf">Figure 2</A></strong>). "At the price of the additional pin, you save 		almost an order of magnitude [of current]. With shutdown, you actually force 		the device to go inactive and wake it up to turn fully on." </p>     <p>Shutdown pins are not panaceas, however. Nolan of ADI, cautions, 		"Amplifiers take a certain amount of time to bias up into proper operation, 		and, typically, the lower the normal power consumption, the longer it takes it 		to turn on, especially if you use the really low-power amplifiers to begin 		with." Plus, shutdown affects only the op amp itself; the sensor circuitry is 		still dissipating power. Nolan says that designers often prefer to use an 		external switch and turn off power to both the amplifier and the sensor 		circuitry (<strong><A  href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.edn.com/contents/images/601827f3.pdf  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.edn.com/contents/images/601827f3.pdf'" tppabs="http://www.edn.com/contents/images/601827f3.pdf">Figure 3</A></strong> and <strong><A href="#ref">references 1</strong> <STRONG>and</STRONG>  <strong>2</A></strong>).</p>     <p>Linear Technology's Regan agrees with this caveat regarding the 		"spin-up" time of a shutdown op amp, pointing out that most shutdown turn-on 		and -off times are not guaranteed: Manufacturers specify only typical times. 		Long turn-on and -off times, he says, "affect the on time of a low-duty-cycle 		system, resulting in a reduction in total lifetime of the battery. Instead of 		lasting 10 years, it might last only five." Regan suggests that you make sure 		that your design can live with the turn-on and -off times.</p>     <p>The third factor in designing with op amps for low-power, low-duty-cycle 		systems is drive current. A standard op amp might have a short-circuit current 		of 20 mA compared with a low-power op amp's 500 &#181;A to 1 mA. Drive 		current goes even lower with systems requiring less than 3V. A standard op amp 		with a 5V supply can typically provide 10 mA of current, but in an 		ultralow-power system operating from a single power cell at, say, 1.8V, it can 		provide only 1 mA. Says Regan, "The device doesn't have the voltage headroom to 		fully bias the current source to provide the base current to the output 		transistor. These low-power devices can't source and sink as much current."</p>     <p>Battery-output voltage over time also affects drive current. Small coin 		batteries, such as a lithium primary cell, start out fully charged at about 3V 		and continue to emit current even when the voltage drops down as low as 1.5V. 		System designers need to select devices that are tolerant not only of a low 		supply voltage, but also a voltage range that can start out high and fall as 		the battery drains. In ultra-low-power systems, low currents eliminate the need 		for power-conditioning parts, such as regulators, so that the system can run 		directly off the battery.</p>     <p>Regan suggests a source for general low-voltage analog-design 		techniques: Read fellow Linear Technology engineer (and popular 		<i>EDN</i> contributing author) Jim Williams' 		application note, "Micropower Circuits for Signal Conditioning," available 		online (<strong><A href="#ref">Reference 3</A></strong>). Although Williams wrote 		it in 1987, the principles it covers are still relevant today.

However, 		  that's not the case for Alice Wang, PhD, who examines the trade-off between 		  energy and speed for an FFT processor (<strong><A href="#sideref">Reference 		  A</A></strong>). The application for the processor is powering a node in a 		  wireless-sensor network that harvests its system energy from the environment. 		  Due to the requirements for energy scavenging, the key metric is minimizing 		  energy dissipation rather than processor speed. Wang's research focuses on the 		  use of subthreshold design, which runs circuits at a voltage supply that is 		  lower than the threshold voltage of the device.</p>     <p>Wang's processor runs as low as 180 mV compared with a typical 		  processor threshold range of 1 to 1.2V. The relationship between voltage and 		  speed is exponential: A system running at 1 GHz at 1.2V would be running in the 		  kilohertz range. Because of the trade-off of power for speed, subthreshold 		  design is a candidate for future low-duty-cycle systems. </p>     <p>Wang's processor architecture also employs other energy-saving 		  characteristics, such as variable bit precision, which allows the processing 		  precision to degrade based on the immediate needs of the processing function. 		  Wang says that lowering the voltage to the subthreshold level is the biggest 		  factor in achieving the least energy. Although Wang's research uses a custom 		  processor, her findings apply to off-the-shelf parts, as well. Look to see more 		  designers applying subthreshold approaches in the future as ultralow-power 		  devices, which must harvest energy from their environment, become increasingly 		  common.</p>     <p>         <strong><a name="#sideref">Reference</strong>     </p>     <ol>         <li>A.
