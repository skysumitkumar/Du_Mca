<h1>PCI Express and ASI: avoiding chaos at 2 Gbps</h1>

What's more, elements of PCIe, particularly the physical layer, may become even 		more pervasive as part of ASI (Advanced Switching Interconnect), an ambitious 		protocol targeting applications that require performance higher than that of 		typical desktop and laptop PCs. The ASI SIG (Special Interest Group) names 		communications, storage, servers, and embedded systems as target markets but 		does not limit ASI's potential to those markets.</p>     <p>ASI appears to bring many benefits to high-speed data-transmission. For 		example, unlike the host-centric PCIe, ASI enables peer-to-peer communication 		among a system's peripheral devices&#8212;or among CPUs in systems that 		incorporate multiple CPUs. Because it allows multiple conversations to take 		place simultaneously among these devices, the peer-to-peer feature can greatly 		speed information flow in complex systems. Other ASI features that PCIe doesn't 		support include QOS (quality of service); protocol tunneling, which enables 		ASI-based systems to support multiple protocols; and the fabric switching that 		is at the heart of ASI.</p>     <p>Nevertheless, according to its detractors, ASI faces stiff competition 		from older protocols, such as RIO (RapidIO)&#8212;especially with the new 		RapidFabric extensions, InfiniBand, FibreChannel, and a sizable list of 		proprietary protocols that have established substantial bases of users, most of 		whom allegedly see no particular advantage in changing horses for the 		foreseeable future. Many in the industry regard Ethernet as a key competitor, 		but the ASI SIG's position is that that long-lived protocol complements and 		does not compete with ASI.</p>     <p>Current single-lane PCIe implementations transmit data at a maximum rate 		of 2 Gbps in each direction. The raw data rate is 25% higher&#8212;2.5 		Gbps&#8212;because PCIe, like most high-speed-serial protocols, uses 8B/10B 		(8-bit/10-bit) coding to embed the clock within the data stream. However, both 		PCIe and ASI allow the use of multiple lanes, which can increase data-transfer 		rates by factors as large as 32. Already, advanced video subsystems in some 		premium-priced desktop PCs that target video gaming are using unidirectional 		16-lane-wide versions of PCIe to transmit data at 32 Gbps&#8212;equivalent to 		4 Gbytes/sec. Despite such mind-numbing speed, these desktop systems don't 		require ASI's advanced features, so a unidirectional version of PCIe is the 		appropriate choice.</p>     <a name="Rapid deployment"><strong>Rapid deployment</strong></a>     <p><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0" align="right" valign="top" id="boombox" style="background-color:#DDE6ED;padding:19px;">

Manufacturers of PCs and peripherals are deploying PCIe at a rate that, 		figuratively speaking, rivals the rates at which data travels on the bus 		(<strong><A href="#ref">Reference 1</A></strong>). And these manufacturers seem 
undeterred by difficulties in obtaining from the PCI SIG certain detailed 
information that could come in handy to engineers creating new equipment 
designs. A key reason that gaps in the information that the SIG has so far 
provided have not hindered adoption of PCIe is the voluminous information 
available from the PICMG (PCI Industrial Computer Manufacturers' Group). PICMG's 
role complements the roles of protocol-specific industry groups, such as the PCI 
SIG and the ASI SIG. Although PICMG defines no communication protocols, it does 
publish system-physical-architecture specifications that enable designers to 
successfully implement protocols that other groups have defined. Moreover, PICMG 
member companies provide the hardware for these implementations. Recently, PICMG 
completed what it calls the largest spec-writing effort in its 11-year history. 
The result is a group of specifications collectively describing the modular ATCA 
(Advanced Telecommunications Computing Architecture) (<STRONG><A 
href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.edn.com/contents/images/601851f1.pdf  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.edn.com/contents/images/601851f1.pdf'" tppabs="http://www.edn.com/contents/images/601851f1.pdf">Picture</A></STRONG>).</p>     <p>Among many others, the PCI SIG's PCIe specs and the ASI SIG's ASI specs 		complement the ATCA specs&#8212;although PICMG prefers to call the protocol 		specs subsidiary to ATCA. Versions of the ATCA spec define how to implement the 		architecture with different communication protocols. One spec covers both the 		ASI and the PCIe versions. This commonality should come as no surprise because 		the two protocols share both their physical and data-link layers, although 		ASI's switch fabric will almost certainly require module-resident hardware that 		PCIe doesn't use. What may come as a surprise, though, is that PICMG has so far 		found that one card-cage design, one backplane design, and one module format 		are sufficient to implement versions of ATCA that support at least half a dozen 		communication protocols.</p>     <p>Module manufacturers have even developed prototype plug-in ATCA-format 		line-card modules that they can adapt to any of several communication protocols 		simply by loading the appropriate software. However, according to Gilles 		Garcia, director of marketing for switched-fabric products at AMCC (Applied 		MicroCircuits Corp), line cards built around network processors need more than 		software to adapt to ASI or RIO/RapidFabric. These protocols require additional 		glue logic implemented in FPGAs. Garcia sees no motivation to develop new 		network processors that subsume this external logic because the marketplace 		isn't yet demanding line cards that support ASI or RapidFabric.</p>     <a name="Promising implications"><strong>Promising implications</strong></a>     <p>Nevertheless, ATCA's implications appear promising indeed: In telecom 		central-office equipment, the architecture appears poised to become a unifying 		force that will enable competing companies to produce physically similar 		hardware. This unification will bring about component-level economies of scale 		that help to control costs and drive product differentiation to the 		system-software level, at which many believe it belongs. Indeed, ATCA 		visionaries see the architecture's transcending the telecom market space and 		invading such computing areas as clustered servers, producing further economies 		of scale.</p>     <p>While it was busily at work on ATCA, PICMG scarcely ignored less complex 		systems. Always mindful of its roots in the older, parallel versions of PCI, 		the organization has focused on updating architectures that it pioneered for 		smaller systems. The best known of these is CompactPCI. PICMG is nearly ready 		to announce a specification for a PCIe-based version of this architecture. The 		group expects the old and new CompactPCI architectures to coexist for many 		years as the PCIe-based architecture gradually supplants the parallel version 		in new equipment designs. PICMG is also specifying a 95&#215;125-mm PCIe-based 		mezzanine-card format that not only can supplant earlier mezzanine cards, but 		also may replace PC-104 boards in some embedded-system applications.</p>     <p>Many people think of PCIe as merely a bus for interconnects on and 		between pc boards within a system enclosure. Also, despite the multilane 		configuration that high-end video subsystems use, most applications use a 		single-lane, bidirectional configuration comprising two signal pairs.</p>     <p>Still, needs exist to run PCIe through cables and to place multilane 		versions in backplanes. For the backplane application, which will be common in 		ASI-based systems, designers have a choice of connectors that are mechanically 		and electrically acceptable. Prices vary, but some of these parts deserve to be 		called downright inexpensive when you consider their amazing electrical 		performance. At press time, however, the PCI SIG had not named one design as 		the "official" PCIe backplane connector, although PICMG's ATCA specs call for 		the ZD series, currently available from Tyco/Amp and ERNI. Though ATCA does not 		reference them, other backplane connectors, including Teradyne Connection 		Systems' GbX series, are electrically suitable.</p>     <p>And, although rumors exist that the PCI SIG has made an internal choice 		of a cable connector, no official announcement has emerged, and the vendor 		whose design the SIG is rumored to have selected refuses to make any 		comment&#8212;or even to provide information about the design. Purportedly, 		the need to resolve licensing issues has caused the announcement delay. 		Nevertheless, Rajeev Kumar of Intel, chairman of the ASI SIG, says that he has 		observed good results with routing of PCIe signals over cables as long as 7m 		that were designed for other standards. He mentions Molex cables that were 		designed for SAS (serial-attached SCSI) and Gore CX4 cables that were designed 		for 10-Gbps Ethernet. He adds that, in some cases, you can obtain electrically 		and mechanically equivalent cables from several sources.</p>     <a name="A bit easier than you may think"><strong>A bit easier than you may think</strong></a>     <p>Just the idea of transmitting data error-free at 2 Gbps and more can be 		intimidating. Nevertheless, the task, though far from trivial and not to be 		approached lightly, may be easier than many people suspect. Not too many years 		ago, the only engineers who would even consider dealing with such high 		frequencies were microwave engineers. However, whereas the frequencies in PCIe 		data streams and microwave circuits are comparable, the technologies have less 		in common than you might think.</p>     <p>The reason is that the serial buses carry information in digital form, 		whereas classical microwave designs are traditionally analog. Despite the 		millivolt signal levels in the differential pairs that carry information on 		buses such as PCIe, you generally need to know the voltage levels with only 		about 20% accuracy; the voltage differences between the one and the zero levels 		are usually greater than the absolute voltage on either line of the 		differential pair. In other words, the buses work because they were designed to 		tolerate errors.</p>     <p>As a result, a reasonable amount of ringing after a one-to-zero or 		zero-to-one transition is not usually fatal. Still, discontinuities and 		reflections in transmission paths can and do cause errors, so you must design 		pc boards, connectors, backplanes, and cables to minimize crosstalk and to 		maintain a constant-impedance environment with minimal discontinuities, and you 		must also minimize delay differences that cause skew between signals that are 		supposed to reach receivers simultaneously.</p>     <p>In addition, when you work with signals at several gigahertz, the 		dielectric losses in pc substrates and cables become appreciable, attenuating 		signal swings and slowing (lowpass-filtering) signal edges. In all probability, 		without the introduction of pre-emphasis into the circuits that drive 		high-speed serial buses, the design problem would be orders of magnitude more 		complicated, and data reliability that designers now take for granted would be 		unachievable.</p>     <a name="Adaptive equalization"><strong>Adaptive equalization</strong></a>     <p>The object of pre-emphasis is to shape the edges of signals that leave 		the driver so that the distortion (lowpass-filtering) introduced by the 		dielectric losses produces nearly ideal waveforms at the receiver input. But, 		because the amount of distortion depends on material properties and the length 		of signal paths, the tuning problem could be intractable were it not for 		<i>adaptive</i> equalization. You can find adaptive 		equalization in some IP (intellectual-property) cores for ultrahigh-speed 		serial buses. At 2.5 Gbps, the current generation of PCIe is too slow to 		require the technique, but if the data rate reaches 5 Gbps, future generations 		may.</p>     <p>Adaptive equalization simplifies the task of designing pc boards, 		backplanes, and cables that work reliably at multigigabit-per-second data 		rates. And it can do so without requiring tedious manual tuning or the use of 		pc substrates and cable dielectrics made of low-loss materials whose costs 		greatly exceed those of familiar materials. However, even with the use of 		adaptive equalization, ultrahigh-speed designs still require extreme care. For 		example, unless the component-level circuit models accurately describe the 		component behavior, no simulation of a multigigahertz design can accurately 		predict the performance of the complete circuit. In the area of how best to 		characterize and model components such as connectors, backplanes, and cables, 		the industry's signal-integrity experts seem to be embroiled in a controversy (see <strong><A href="#sidebar">sidebar</strong></A> "Don't let fixture performance invalidate connector measurements").</p>     <p>To quickly and economically get new designs to market, designers need 		rules that they can apply easily and without a lot of thought. To this end, the 		PCI SIG and its member companies have gone to unprecedented lengths and great 		expense to provide component characterization and design-rule information that 		engineers must consider in their designs.</p>     <p>Nevertheless, some signal-integrity consultants, such as Edward P Sayre, 		PhD, president of NESA (North East Systems Associates Inc), say they are 		concerned that a few designers may interpret the SIG's approach as, "We've done 		all the thinking and encapsulated the results in rules; all designers need to 		do is follow the rules without thinking." Says Sayre, "That's not what the SIG 		intends, but if that's what some engineers believe, the ones who haven't given 		their designs adequate consideration are going to wish that they had taken a 		little more time to understand why their circuits and layouts behave as they 		do." Sayre describes the SIG's work as impressive, but he says that years in 		the field have taught him that, although design rules are invaluable, they 		can't replace an understanding of the underlying circuit behavior.

This document describes the methodology for measuring the performance of 
            PCI Express connectors to 10 GHz, using a custom test fixture and a 
            four-port VNA (vector-network analyzer). You can also use a more 
            accurate and flexible probe-based methodology for such high-speed 
            serial-interconnect measurements.</P>
            <P>Fixture-based validation of connector designs is desirable for 
            several reasons. First, the drive for industry standards works best 
            when all interested parties avoid correlation problems by using 
            consistent test hardware. In addition, using SMA connectors 
            simplifies implementation of the fixturing interface (<STRONG><A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.edn.com/contents/images/601851fA.pdf  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.edn.com/contents/images/601851fA.pdf'" tppabs="http://www.edn.com/contents/images/601851fA.pdf">Figure A</A></STRONG>) because SMAs are the de facto standard connections 
            for high-frequency measurements.</P>     <p>Unfortunately, in many cases, connectors and traces on high-speed test 		  fixtures can make the fixtures' performance inferior to that of the devices the 		  fixtures are supposed to help characterize. Often, a fixture exhibits signal 		  loss greater than that of the device under test. If the device is inherently a 		  two-port element&#8212;that is, a device that has one input and one 		  output&#8212;with little crosstalk between the ports, you can use T-matrix 		  manipulation to subtract the fixture contribution. On the other hand, if the 		  device under test has four ports that suffer from fixture-level crosstalk, 		  de-embedding the fixture contribution becomes difficult. To overcome these 		  fixture limitations, you must usually move the measurement reference plane as 		  close to the device under test as possible. You can achieve this close spacing 		  by using microwave probes (<strong><A              href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.edn.com/contents/images/601851fB.pdf  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.edn.com/contents/images/601851fB.pdf'" tppabs="http://www.edn.com/contents/images/601851fB.pdf">Figure B</A></strong>).</p>     <p>By using a calibration substrate (<strong><A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.edn.com/contents/images/601851fC.pdf  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.edn.com/contents/images/601851fC.pdf'" tppabs="http://www.edn.com/contents/images/601851fC.pdf">Figure              C</A></strong>), you can de-embed the measurement system's response all the way 		  to the probe tips. In many cases, you can directly probe the device; in the 		  worst case, you can add vias to the board for use as probing points. Either 		  way, the measured data usually requires little or no de-embedding.</p>     <p>When pins on which you make no measurements require termination, you 		  encounter the sole disadvantage of using probes. Then, you must use SMT 		  (surface-mount-technology) resistors to terminate the pins. The red plots in 		  <strong><A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.edn.com/contents/images/601851fD.pdf  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.edn.com/contents/images/601851fD.pdf'" tppabs="http://www.edn.com/contents/images/601851fD.pdf">Figure              D</A></strong> show a connector's TDR 		  (time-domain-reflectometer) performance as measured with a fixture that has SMA 		  connectors plus a 6-in. stripline trace on an FR4 substrate.

Also, 		  extracting an equivalent-circuit model of the fixtured connector requires 		  extensive effort, because you must include the fixture in the response. Doing 		  so adversely affects the model's quality and bandwidth.</p>     <p>The use of fixtures is desirable to ensure compatibility and 		  correlation, but you pay for this convenience with reduced measurement accuracy 		  and reduced bandwidth in the device you are testing.</p>
