At the same time, 		however, it has reduced ICs' native robustness in the face of common and 		unavoidable electrical transient hazards.<br>     <br>In broad strokes, transient sources segment into lightning, switching, 		EMP (electromagnetic pulse), and ESD (electrostatic discharge). Of the four, 		EMPs are thankfully rare, deriving most famously from nuclear events. But, like 		EMP, virtually all sources of electrical transients derive from a sudden 		release of stored energy. Lightning and ESD result from the sudden release of 		static charge; switching transients typically originate from the collapse of an 		electrostatic or electromagnetic field due to a sudden change in current or 		voltage in the presence of explicit or parasitic reactances.<br>     <br>Sources within a classification tend to exhibit similar time-domain 		characteristics. Switching transients, for example, tend to be periodic with 		amplitude and repetition rates that vary by the details of an installation. 		Lightning and ESD strikes are aperiodic and locationally unpredictable beyond 		broad geographic trends (<strong><A  href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.edn.com/contents/images/514947f1.pdf  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.edn.com/contents/images/514947f1.pdf'" tppabs="http://www.edn.com/contents/images/514947f1.pdf">Figure 1</A></strong>).

Various industry segments have developed and 		promoted a variety of source standards and test methods. Though standards can 		differ in important areas, such as charge storage and source impedance, for 		example, they tend to agree in principle on how transient hazards typically 		appear to otherwise-unsuspecting circuits (<strong><A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.edn.com/contents/images/514947t1.pdf  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.edn.com/contents/images/514947t1.pdf'" tppabs="http://www.edn.com/contents/images/514947t1.pdf">Table  1</A></strong>). This tabular data doesn't tell the complete story: Transient 		waveforms are not square but tend to exhibit fast exponential rise times, 		comparatively slow exponential decays, and little or no dwell times at their 		peak amplitude.</p>     <p>For any given node that is susceptible to a hazardous transient, a 		protection method must simultaneously meet several requirements. The method 		must be able to clamp the protected node to a safe potential. An appropriate 		protection device, therefore, varies according to the type of circuit it is 		protecting. The protection device must respond fast enough to the transient's 		rising edge to keep the node voltage below the destructive threshold. 		Low-inductance shunt devices and low-capacitance series elements help meet this 		requirement but only if the pc board's design exploits good high-speed-layout 		techniques for the protection network. Lastly, the protection method must 		either be able to absorb the energy that a transient event delivers or cause 		the dissipation to occur in the transient source impedance. For this reason, 		OEM designers cannot always depend on the semiconductor's on-chip protection 		cells and often must add pc-board-level protection elements. A prudent first 		step in determining a protection method for a given transient type, therefore, 		is to calculate the total strike energy that your circuit must absorb. Also 		consider the likely repetition rates and thermal time constants to ensure that 		clamping elements don't overheat in the heat of the moment.</p>     <p><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0" align="right" valign="top" id="boombox" style="background-color:#DDE6ED;padding:19px;">

The most commonly susceptible nodes are a system's exposed ports. These 		include the power entry and signal I/Os. They can also include internal nodes 		that are near an insulating surface as is the case in keyboards and displays. 		Transients needn't originate on a particular lead to damage its associated 		circuitry. Transients occurring on leads connected to one subsystem can 		capacitively couple to leads connected to other subsystems before breakdown or 		can inductively couple during the current ramp that immediately follows 		breakdown. In such cases, protecting the primary victim may not suffice. For 		example, if an installation bundles signal leads with power feeds, then a 		power-line transient induced by, say, a motor could couple to a signal node, 		albeit at reduced amplitude.</p>     <p>High-speed circuits are challenging to protect because they can be 		sensitive to the additional shunt-capacitance loading that clamping schemes add 		to the protected node. This reason is one of several that fiber-optic feeds are 		attractive in high-speed communications, even for short-haul applications, such 		as rack-to-rack links (<strong><A href="#ref">references 1</strong> and 		<strong>2</A></strong>).</p>     <p>Isolated front ends, common in industrial and medical 		signal-conditioning applications, block large common-mode voltages and pass the 		signal's differential-mode component. The common-mode component appears across 		the isolation barrier, which offers a finite breakdown voltage, often in the 		range of 500V to 2 kV.

Although POTS feeds have modest bandwidth 		requirements, DSL deployments are supposed to piggyback on the POTS 		infrastructure, so protection devices must contribute a minimum shunt 		capacitance, as is the case for cable TV. GDTs (gas-discharge tubes), also 		known as gas-plasma arrestors, are good first lines of defense for such large 		distributed systems.</p>     <p>Under normal operating conditions, the shunt impedance of a GDT is on 		the order of 1 T&#937; in parallel with 1 pF or less. The GDT's low leakage 		current&#8212;typically less than 1 pA&#8212;and low capacitance vary little 		with applied potentials less than the gas-ionization, or "glow," voltage. Once 		the tube reaches the glow voltage, the impedance drops precipitously, resulting 		in a current through the gas. Increasing current causes the gas mass to form a 		plasma, which causes the voltage across the device to drop further to the 		neighborhood of 15V. The plasma self-extinguishes when the source can no longer 		supply the plasma current. The net effect is a crowbar behavior that can limit 		the voltage during a transient event to the neighborhood of 15V in less than 1 		&#181;sec. One key advantage of the GDT is that it forces most of the 		dissipation to occur in the transient's source impedance and not in either the 		protective device or the protected circuitry. A combination of the signal's 		voltage-rise rate (dV/dt), the tube's electrode spacing, the gas type, and the 		gas pressure determine the actuation voltage (<strong><A href="#ref">Reference 		3</A></strong>). Devices can sustain currents as large as 20 kA.</p>     <p>GDTs are available in both single- and triple-pole forms (<strong><A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.edn.com/contents/images/514947f3.pdf  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.edn.com/contents/images/514947f3.pdf'" tppabs="http://www.edn.com/contents/images/514947f3.pdf">Figure  3</A></strong>). The triple-pole GDT is a deceptively simple device that 		maintains a differential pair's balance during those critical moments when all 		hell is breaking loose: Small asymmetries can allow a transient to couple 		preferentially to one side of a balanced feed, imposing an enormous 		differential signal as a result. Slight differences in the response behavior of 		two protection devices can also allow a destructive amplitude to appear at a 		system's input terminals, even when the transient event appears symmetrically 		on the balanced line. The triple-pole GDT provides one differential and two 		shunt devices in one tube with a common gas volume. Any condition that causes 		conduction between a pole pair causes conduction between all three poles, 		because the gas' state&#8212;insulating, ionized, or plasma&#8212;determines 		the tube's behavior.</p>     <a name="Get a MOV on"><strong>Get a MOV on</strong></a>     <p>MOVs (metal-oxide varistors) are nonlinear voltage-variable resistors. 		Sintered metal oxides form a structure that models as a series pair of 		back-to-back zener diodes. Under normal operating conditions, MOVs exhibit a 		typical leakage current on the order of 10 &#181;A and a shunt capacitance in 		the region of 45 pF. A voltage that increases beyond the MOV's threshold causes 		one of the distributed diodes to avalanche, which causes the device to clamp 		the protected node. Increasing current eventually causes the voltage across the 		device to rise&#8212;a limiting factor common with most bulk materials.</p>     <p>As a clamp device, an MOV largely absorbs the transient energy, as 		opposed to a gas-plasma device, which causes most of the dissipation to occur 		in the transient's source resistance and in the resistances between the 		transient site and the protected node. In applications, such as power, POTS, 		and industrial sensors, that can tolerate a MOV's leakage and shunt 		capacitance, MOVs provide good secondary protection from lightning-induced 		transients in concert with GDTs because they trigger an order of magnitude 		faster than do gas-plasma arresters. Excess heating of an MOV can degrade its 		behavior in ways that accumulate over repeated thermal overstresses. Therefore, 		be sure to carefully analyze the transient specification you plan to support, 		determine the amount of energy you require an MOV to absorb and the worst-case 		transient repetition rate, and conservatively specify the device.</p>     <a name="Finger lightning"><strong>Finger lightning</strong></a>     <p>The most common transient hazard for OEM electronics is ESD. When 		designing protection schemes that prevent ESD damage, you have to address three 		problem areas: First, the availability of numerous standards means that 		multiple source models exist. You must determine early on in the design cycle 		which source model and test method is most relevant to your application. In the 		event that your IC suppliers specify their parts with other source models, you 		need to assess how reliably they're likely to perform to the source model and 		test method you choose. If robustness in the face of ESD is important to your 		customers, you may need to test working prototypes of I/O-port subsystems and 		elements of the human interface.</p>     <p>Second, modern high-speed I/O ports tolerate little ac loading without 		suffering substantial signal degradation, so protective devices must add little 		extra shunt capacitance. Assess your application's sensitivity to additional 		shunt capacitance at the I/O port by considering the signal's source impedance 		under normal operating conditions in the context of the port's required 		bandwidth.</p>     <p>Finally, the silicon processes that have enabled high-speed I/Os exhibit 		low damage thresholds, so be sure that your protection method clamps fast 		enough and fixes the protected node to a sufficiently low voltage. Virtually 		all ICs have ESD-protective cells, which can substantially aid your design. But 		not all vendors subscribe to the same source models and test methods, so be 		clear on a candidate IC's native robustness before you design it into your 		application. You may also want to limit a contract manufacturer's freedom to 		substitute ICs that attach to susceptible nodes unless the selection criteria 		take matters of robustness and reliability into account.</p>     <p>ESD source models divide into three categories, according to the charge 		source: the HBM (human-body model), CDM (charged-device model), and MM (machine 		model). CDMs and MMs describe ESD hazards that can accrue in manufacturing 		environments or by allowing charge to collect on a finished product's 		insulating surfaces, most notably by triboelectrically displacing electrons. 		The HBM is the most common description for the hazards products face after 		their manufacture. That said, the groupings are hardly mutually exclusive, and 		you'll want to consider, for example, what exposure your product will have to 		sources and scenarios that correspond to each of the three model types. For 		example, the MM can also describe events in which a human charge source 		discharges through an intermediary conductor, as can be the case when 		technicians use small hand tools without first dispensing their accumulated 		charge to a nearby ground terminal.</p>     <p>Of the standards that describe HBM sources, the one the IC industry most commonly 		cites is IEC-64000, which includes air-discharge and direct-contact test 		methods. The model specifies a 150-pF charge reservoir behind a source resistance 		of 330&#937; (<strong><A  href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.edn.com/contents/images/514947f4.pdf  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.edn.com/contents/images/514947f4.pdf'" tppabs="http://www.edn.com/contents/images/514947f4.pdf">Figure 4</A></strong>). Most ESD 		models include a high-impedance charge path so that the charging circuit 		doesn't influence the test and vice versa.</p>     <p>By comparison, military standard 883 uses a 100-pF charge reservoir and 		a 1.5-k&#937; source resistance, which limits the total energy and peak 		current to a fraction of the amplitude IEC-64000 allows. These two source 		models demonstrate that an ESD specification is uninformative if it gives only 		a test voltage. A manufacturer must identify the source model and test method 		to give you a context in which to evaluate the ESD specification. Other common 		ESD standards include EIAJ IC121 for MMs and US ESD DS 5.3 for CDMs (<strong><A href="#ref">Reference 4</A></strong>).</p>     <p>Though the air-discharge test method is more familiar, as Semtech 		Applications Engineering Manager Bill Russell points out, "The direct-contact 		method is more repeatable, it models the most severe test conditions, and it 		represents real-world discharges. We have more [OEM] customers that use the 		direct-contact test method exclusively during design and don't worry about the 		air-discharge method than the other way around. The direct-contact method also 		allows you to test specific nodes on a dense assembly, whereas the 		air-discharge is less controllable. IEC 61000-4-2 level 4 requires contact 		discharges of 8 kV, but nowadays lots of manufacturers aren't stopping there: 		They're testing to 10 or 12 kV, particularly in portable electronics." Though 		ESD voltages can be high, the total energy is fairly modest. For example, using 		the IEC 61000-4-2 HBM model, a 10-kV strike imparts 7.5 mJ and varies as the 		voltage squared.</p>     <p>TVSs (transient-voltage suppressors) are avalanche diodes. Traditionally 		a TVS's shunt capacitance was several tens of picofarads, but some current 		devices add less than 10 pF. Leakage currents tend to be 100 &#181;A or more 		for the lowest voltage parts, but these numbers tend to fall to 5 &#181;A or 		less for parts that operate at 12V or more.</p> <P>The current trends in TVSs include greater integration to support dense  portable devices. Multiple devices in chip-scale packages set node spacing to  better match the protected IC or the interface connector. Integrated TVS and EMI  filters address two critical challenges in one package and simplify your task to  route buses through I/Os. Due to their compactness, multi-TVS packages have  become the most common protection devices for dense assemblies.</P> <P><br>&nbsp;</P> <P><hr>  <P></P> <P><table border="0" width="100%"

            for two videos of lithium-ion batteries subjected to overcurrent 
            conditions in a laboratory environment. Videos courtesy 		  Texas Instruments.)</p>     <p>Yet properly designed lithium-ion packs, including well-designed and 		  -manufactured cells with adequate venting, good charge control and cutoff 		  circuits, and good mechanical design, prevent failures of safety features that 		  might result from mechanical shock.</p>     <p>Unfortunately, expensive replacement packs have inspired 		  counterfeit-battery manufacturers that do not necessarily take the same 		  precautions that your company does when specifying a pack design. As a result, 		  for example, Verizon Wireless last June recalled 50,000 counterfeit LG phone 		  batteries, and Kyocera in October recalled as many as a million counterfeit 		  phone batteries (<strong><A href="#sideref">references A</strong> and 		  <strong>B</A></strong>). Other incidences abound, including more 		  than 100 that the Consumer Product Safety Commission has investigated since 		  2002.</p>     <p>Lithium-ion-pack specifiers can use several ways to protect their 		  customers and their company's reputation. Some pack manufacturers have 		  developed design and manufacturing standards that result in safer packs. One 		  such manufacturer, Micro Power, has codified its design and manufacturing 		  requirements under the name SecuraPack. SecuraPack uses premium cells from 		  qualified vendors, sample-tests incoming cells, ultrasonically welds pack 		  enclosures, provides component traceability, ensures design for 		  extended-temperature ranges, and adheres to the IEEE 1625-2004 standard for 		  rechargeable batteries for portable-computing requirements. SecuraPack also 		  provides failure-mode and -effects analysis on the battery-system design and on 		  the manufacturing process.</p>     <p>A second level of protection is available by means of 		  peripheral-authentication chips, such as those from Maxim's Dallas 		  Semiconductor division and Texas Instruments. These devices allow your system 		  to interrogate removable devices, including batteries. OEMs can still authorize 		  aftermarket battery-pack suppliers that meet the company's safety 		  standards.</p><hr><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0" width="100%">         <tbody>             <tr>                 <td bgcolor="#eeeeee" class="table"><strong><a name="#sideref">References</a></strong></td>             </tr>             <tr>                 <td class="table">                     <ol>                         <li>A.
