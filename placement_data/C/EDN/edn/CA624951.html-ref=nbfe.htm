<title>A bit-o&#39;-power: digitally controlled power conversion - 7/21/2005 - EDN - CA624951</title>

<meta name="description" content="Ironically, perhaps, the last subsystem to undergo a substantive shift from an analog- to a digital-control architecture is the most universal: the power supply. Beware the hype, however. Digital power control may bring performance benefits to some applications, but until you become familiar with the inner machinations, their sophistication will exact a price in application-development time.">

<h1>A bit-o&#39;-power: digitally controlled power conversion</h1>
<h2>Ironically, perhaps, the last subsystem to undergo a substantive
		shift from an analog- to a digital-control architecture is the most universal:
		the power supply. Beware the hype, however. Digital power control may bring
		performance benefits to some applications, but until you become familiar with

    <p>Within reasonable limits of voltage and current ranges, disparate
		applications often put remarkably similar demands on power-management
		subsystems. This initially counterintuitive observation derives from the facts
		that many applications draw on common core technologies, exploit similar
		functional partitioning schemes, and operate dominantly on only a few different
		energy sources. Independently of what you design, declining operating voltages
		for major subsystems have marked the evolutionary track of many of the
		technologies you use. The supply tolerances that these technologies impose upon
		power subsystems have been in decline, too, in rough proportion to the supply
		voltages. Simultaneously, standing currents have been on the rise, and,
		disproportionately, dynamic currents have as well.</p>
    <a name="In the loop"><strong>In the loop</strong></a>
    <p>The typical SMPS (switch-mode-power-supply) control loop modulates the
		timing of its power switches depending on the subsystem's output voltage
		(<strong><A 
href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.edn.com/contents/images/624951f1.pdf  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.edn.com/contents/images/624951f1.pdf'" tppabs="http://www.edn.com/contents/images/624951f1.pdf">Figure 1</A></strong>). Working clockwise from the output,
		a scaling network samples the output voltage, multiplying it by V<sub>O</sub>(ideal)/V<sub>REF</sub>. The term "error amplifier" is something of a
		misnomer. The device compares the scaling network's output with the reference
		voltage and produces a drive signal for the PWM sufficient to force the two
		input voltages to match. (Some literature describes the error amplifier as
		developing an output signal proportional to the difference between its two
		input signals, which is not the case as long as the loop is operating within
		its linear range.) A compensation network scales the amplifier's dc and
		low-frequency gain appropriately to the PWM's sensitivity and also provides a
		local high-frequency feedback path to ensure adequate phase margin for loop
		stability. This basic structure applies to both isolated and nonisolated
		supplies. You can provide isolation (not shown) either at the power entry or
		within the power-switching block.</p>
    <p>Beyond the basic issues of voltage regulation, this architecture
		accommodates a variety of common ancillary functions with little additional
		complexity. For example, one additional resistor between the reference's output
		and the error amplifier's noninverting input provides a tracking option, which
		allows a regulator to follow another supply rail or voltage source. Here, an
		external voltage source can take control of the regulator's output target as
		long as it can adequately source (or sink as necessary) the reference current:
		|V<sub>TRACK</sub>&#8211;V<sub>REF</sub>|&#247;R<sub>R</sub>. Few functions are implemented so simply, but the
		architecture accommodates such common features as overvoltage protection,
		undervoltage protection, overcurrent protection, and current reporting with
		moderate additional complexity and with little impact on the regulator's loop
		performance.</p>
    <p>Outside the context of a switching regulator, servo circuits similar to
		this one date back to the days of vacuum tubes and are among the best studied,
		characterized, and documented control topologies in the literature (<strong><A href="#ref">Reference 1</A></strong>). Considering the levels of performance that
		modern implementations provide, this loop is a remarkably simple and efficient
		structure, and, until recently, not easy to replace with a digital equivalent.
		Indeed, little more than a year ago, Astec Power Vice President Geof Potter
		stated, "Peripheral functions have long been within the scope of
		digital-control methods because [the] necessary speed and complexity are not
		great. On the other hand, digital control of an active feedback loop, including
		a pulse-modulation process ... has been an elusive prize due to size, cost, and
		power consumption of components needed for practical operation. To successfully
		compete with a low-cost analog-control system, a digital equivalent requires
		data resolution and latency numbers that have been available only in large,
		expensive DSP and ADC products. To compound the difficulty, there are few, if
		any, integrated devices on the market ... that contain all the necessary
		functions to constitute a reasonable [digital] power 'controller'" (<strong><A href="#ref">Reference 2</A></strong>).</p>

The motivation for such devices is multifold: Supplies for product
		variants within a family can use identical power-management circuits with
		model-specific tuning and optimization coded in software or by operational
		coefficients. Onboard self-test programs can reduce, enhance, or eliminate
		production testing of power-management functions, depending on your
		organization's design and test-method policies. A digital power-management
		section can automatically compensate or replace components subject to
		parametric variation over population, time, or temperature. Product and
		accessory identification and recognition schemes can fit into a
		digital-power-management design with little additional hardware and provide
		enhanced safety, product-tracking, and diagnostic information.</p>
    <p>The digitally controlled loop replaces the error amplifier and its
		compensation network with an ADC and a control-law processor; the processor
		often implements a PI (proportional-integral) or PID
		(proportional-integral-derivative) compensator (<strong><A 
href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.edn.com/contents/images/624951f2.pdf  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.edn.com/contents/images/624951f2.pdf'" tppabs="http://www.edn.com/contents/images/624951f2.pdf">Figure 2</A></strong>). The processor can access stored coefficients that determine the
		loop dynamics and can modify those coefficients to optimize operation during
		various normal operating modes, transient events, and faults. The processor's
		output drives the input to a DPWM (digital PWM), which in turn determines the
		switching-edge positions by calculating and timing as opposed to exploiting the
		analog loop's threshold-detection method.</p>
    <p>The macroscopic similarities between the analog- and the
		digital-control-loop topologies mask the complexity of such a replacement. For
		example, both analog- and digital-control loops must compensate for the phase
		lags that the forward path imposes between the power-switch inputs and the
		filter output. The digital implementation must also contend with the additional
		phase lag due to analog-to-digital-conversion delays and computational
		latencies through the control-law processor.</p>
    <p>In addition to operating as a discrete time circuit, the digital-control
		loop is a quantizer, whereas the analog-control loop operates in continuous
		time and amplitude. These distinctions impose structural requirements and
		performance limitations on the digital loop. These constraints have until
		recently made high loop bandwidths and tight output tolerances difficult to
		attain on a large mixed-signal IC. For example, the ADC determines the
		resolution of the output-voltage setting&#8212;the first line item on your
		output-voltage-error budget. You can calculate your minimum resolution from
		your nominal output voltage, V<sub>O</sub>, and the
		setting resolution, &#916;V<sub>O</sub>:</p>

<P>To prevent limit-cycle oscillations in the output, quantizers that
		follow the ADC, including the DPWM, must exhibit a greater resolution than the
		ADC (<strong><A

<P>The DPWM essentially translates bits of amplitude into bits of time. The
		power section's switching rate and the converter's amplitude resolution set the
		DPWM's minimum timing resolution: The DPWM must fit 2<sup>m</sup> bits within the power section's switching interval. 
For example, in a controller that follows an 8-bit DAC with a 9-bit DPWM 
controlling a power section with a 1-MHz switching rate, the DPWM timing 
resolution is</P>

    <p>The reciprocal of the DPWM timing resolution gives the DPWM clock rate,
		which for this modest example is</p>

    <p>As the voltage-setting resolution increases, the DPWM clock does
		likewise: one octave per bit. Because some emission is likely at both the
		system and the DPWM, consider the radiated-noise spectrum of a power supply
		that uses a digitally controlled loop in the context of your application's
		signal band before committing to the power-subsystem design. Also, be sure to
		observe good high-frequency-layout practices, particularly in the regions of
		the switch-drive and clock signals. Conduction of RF from the regulated dc
		output, V<sub>O</sub>, is unlikely due to the output
		filter, but radiated RF emissions are still a layout concern (<strong><A href="#ref">Reference 3</A></strong>).</p>

    <p>The theoretical and technological-development work behind digital power
		controllers has been ongoing for some years, but this spring brought the
		announcement of ICs that implement the architecture from Texas Instruments and
		Silicon Laboratories. The Texas Instruments approach is a two-chip set with
		several options to accommodate a variety of SMPS topologies (<strong><A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.edn.com/contents/images/624951f4.pdf  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.edn.com/contents/images/624951f4.pdf'" tppabs="http://www.edn.com/contents/images/624951f4.pdf">Figure 
4</A></strong>). ICs from the UCD9k and UCD7k families combine
		with your power-switching and filter sections to form a complete power
		subsystem.</p>
    <p>The UCD7100 and 7201 single- and dual-channel, low-side MOSFET gate
		drivers feature microcontroller- and DSP-compatible inputs and can operate at
		switching rates as fast as 2 MHz. The drivers can typically source or sink 4A
		and feature maximum rise and fall times of 20 and 15 nsec, respectively, when
		driving 2.2-nF loads. The maximum input-to-output propagation delay is 35 nsec.
		Both drivers provide cycle-by-cycle current limiting, programmable limit
		thresholds, and logic-level limit-status flag outputs. The ICs can operate
		supplies in the range of 4.5 to 15V and include an on-chip 3.3V regulator rated
		for 10 mA, which you can use to power external circuits, such as a low-power
		microcontroller or ASIC. The 99-cent, single-channel and $1.20, dual-channel
		drivers are available in QFN-14 and QFN-16 packages, respectively. Both parts
		are also available in HTSSOP-14 packages and are rated for operation at &#8211;40 to
		+105&#176;C.</p>
    <p>TI also currently offers four other drivers in the UCD7k family. Various
		members include a synchronous-buck driver with current sensing, and single- and
		dual-channel, low-side drivers with 110V start-up capability. The dual-channel
		ICs are available with either independent or common current sensing. Members of
		the UCD7k-family drivers mate with a variety of processors, including the
		UCD9501 and its kin. The 9501, the first of the UCD9k family, comprises a
		100-MHz, 32-bit Harvard DSP core; a clock- and timing-control block; a 12-bit,
		6.25M-sample/sec ADC; extensive digital I/O, including PWM outputs; and
		memory.</p>
    <p>The ADC features a 16-channel multiplexer and a sample-and-hold
		amplifier and operates over a 3V unipolar range. You can program the ADC to
		synchronize with the PWM outputs or initiate a conversion by either software
		command or hardware interrupt. A built-in sequencer can take as many as 16
		samples with one command. You can program the sequencer to take each sample
		from any of the 16 input channels. The converter's INL (integral nonlinearity)
		and DNL (differential nonlinearity) are typically 1.5 and 1 LSBs, respectively,
		at 6.25M samples/sec; the manufacturer provides no limit specs. Similarly,
		ac-converter specifications are available only as typical values: 76-dB SFDR
		(spurious-free dynamic range), 67-dB SNR, and 10.6-bit ENOB (effective number
		of bits), all at 100 kHz, suggest that the converter is largely noise-limited
		but at sufficiently low values for power-management applications. When the
		device is operating with a 100-MHz system clock, on-chip timers can set the
		output edge positions of the three high-resolution PWM channels to a nominal
		granularity of 150 psec. At a 1-MHz power-switching rate, errors due to the
		PWM's finite-edge-placement resolution fall below the converter's noise
		floor.</p>
    <p>TI offers the $5.79 (1000) digital power controller in an LQFP-100
		package with three temperature-range options extending to 125&#176;C. The IC
		operates on 3.3 and 1.8V supplies and typically dissipates &#189;W. Support tools
		include a $495 eZdsp starter kit, a C/C++ compiler/assembler/linker, TI's Code
		Composer Studio IDE, evaluation modules, JTAG controllers, and TI's DSP/BIOS.
		</p>
    <p>Silicon Labs takes a dual-processor approach that separates all of the
		communication and housekeeping activities from the primary task of loop control
		(<strong><A 
href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.edn.com/contents/images/624951f5.pdf  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.edn.com/contents/images/624951f5.pdf'" tppabs="http://www.edn.com/contents/images/624951f5.pdf">Figure 5</A></strong>). At the block-diagram level, the
		Si8250 digital-power-controller family performs the functions of TI's UCD9k
		family, though their internal architectures significantly differ. That fact
		leaves you to provide the driver and current sensing that the TI UCD7k family
		provides. However, a cursory search reveals some 15 reputable vendors of
		power-MOSFET drivers, so it is reasonable that Silicon Labs didn't reinvent the
		wheel when developing its first power-controller ICs.</p>
    <p> One advantage of the Si8250 that is evident at first glance is its
		size: The dual-processor controller fits into QFN-28 and LQFP-32 packages.
		In exchange for the reduced pinout, the SiLabs part does without some of the
		ADC's multiplexer width&#8212;eight rather than 16 channels&#8212;and the
		8250 family provides a somewhat more modest complement of digital-I/O
		facilities than does the UCD9k, which devotes more pins that
		function&#8212;35&#8212;than does the entirety of the 8250's package. (Ironically, perhaps, the Si8250
		manages to fit in six PWM outputs&#8212;the business end of these
		devices&#8212;compared with the UCD9k's three.) If you can do with the more
		modest facilities of the $2.49 (1000) Si8250, another benefit in addition to
		its relatively reduced girth is a maximum dissipation of 69 mW.</p>
    <p>The 8250 operates with an internal 25-MHz system clock. An internal
		PLL-based clock multiplier derives 50-, 100-, and 200-MHz clocks for the
		loop-control ADC, DPWM, and some peripherals. Programmable options include
		operation with an external clock with an on-chip, 3-bit programmable prescaler
		and an integrated 80-kHz, low-frequency clock, which is useful for certain
		low-power, nonoperational modes.</p>
    <p>Silicon Labs provides a dedicated 10-MHz, 6-bit loop-control ADC and a
		separate 12-bit ADC with an eight-channel multiplexer for current, temperature,
		and other housekeeping measurements. The loop-control ADC meets 2- and 1-bit
		INL- and DNL-limit specs, respectively&#8212;a bit chubby for a 6-bit
		converter from a specsmanship perspective, perhaps, but adequate for many
		power-controller applications. A reference DAC allows you to program the LSB
		size from 2 to 20 mV for a dynamic range of 128 mV to 1.28V. As yet, SiLabs has
		neither specified the loop-control ADC's ac performance, nor announced an
		intention to do so.</p>
    <p>One unusual "feature"&#8212;in the "it's-not-a-bug-it's-a-feature"
		sense of the word&#8212;of the Si8250's 300-page data sheet is that the
		specification table does not exist in a single section. Instead, the document
		tucks away pieces of the table at the end of each table segment's relative
		text. This approach distributes information critical to the part-selection
		process and early-design phases throughout the book-sized data sheet. In many
		cases, you'll find spec-table fragments under subparagraphs that you might
		otherwise hardly notice. Although this organization may be useful for those who
		assembled the data-sheet source materials, it can be cumbersome for users of
		the resultant document. You may, therefore, wish to have the data sheet in PDF
		form on a laptop for quick text searches, particularly if you are developing
		your first application using the 8250. Alternatively, you can arm yourself with
		a healthy supply of Post-it Notes.</p>
    <p>Among the support tools for the Si8250 family is a $199 IDK, which
		features a GUI-based design interface and timing design wizard. The tool set
		comprises a real-time firmware kernel with C source code,
		microcontroller-configuration software, and a USB debugging adapter.</p><hr><table border="0" width="100%" cellPadding="4" cellSpacing="0">

    <td width="100%"><b>This just in: More parts, and an upcoming panel
      discussion</b>
      <p>In addition to the digitally controlled power-conversion ICs from Texas
      Instruments and Silicon Laboratories, devices are now or soon-to-be
      available from Primarion and Zilker Labs, respectively.</p>
      <p>Primarion's PX3535 generates power-switching signals for configurations
      operating one to six power-stage phases. The controller provides
      individual phase-current monitor inputs, which share a common ADC, and a
      high-speed voltage-feedback path that provides a typical bandwidth of 1.5
      MHz. Over temperature, the current-sense amplifier's linearity error and
      current-sense ADC's error contribute a maximum of 2% and 2.2%,
      respectively, to the current-sense INL. Also over temperature, the
      voltage-channel's maximum error contributions include a 0.75%
      voltage-conversion gain term and 9-mV of conversion INL. Typical setpoint
      accuracy is &#177;10 mV over the operating temperature range of 0 to 85&#176;C.
      When comparing several parts for these kinds of specifications, be sure to
      distinguish between performance guarantees that apply over a part's full
      operating-temperature range from those that apply only to room-temperature
      operation.</p>
      <p>The controller allows programmable offsets in the phase-currents for
      thermal balancing in applications that do not afford all phases equal
      cooling. These can include designs that cannot economically provide
      identical air flow for all phases or where some phases are nearer than
      others to dissipating components.</p>
      <p>The IC supports programmable switching frequencies of 100-kHz to 2-MHz,
      which allows significant flexibility in filter- and switching-stage
      design. In addition to common features that enhance the power subsystem's
      robustness, such as on-chip temperature monitoring, output under- and
      over-voltage protection, and per-phase and total-current limits.</p>
      <p>The $1.95 (1000) PX3535 is available in LQFP-48 and QFN-48 packages and
      dissipates less than 0.5W when operating on 3.3V supplies. The controller
      is compatible with VID code maps for Intel and AMD products. It also
      provides space for an OEM programmable code map.</p>
      <p><b>More on the horizon</b></p>
      <p>Expect more semiconductor companies to enter this segment in the coming
      quarters, and with them, a wider variety of architectures. One recent
      startup, Zilker Labs, is taking a hybrid mixed-signal approach in which
      much of the loop's dynamic-control processing remains in the analog domain
      and monitoring and management functions are implemented in digital
      circuitry. This segmentation supports a high-performance controller that
      requires no loop programming and dissipates less power than more
      thoroughly digital architectures. Parts are currently sampling to beta
      customers and a formal announcement of the part is due at the upcoming
      second-annual Digital Power Forum (<a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.darnell.com/digitalpower  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.darnell.com/digitalpower'" tppabs="http://www.darnell.com/digitalpower">www.darnell.com/digitalpower</a>)
      in Boston Sept. 12 through 14.</p>
      <p>The Digital Power Forum will also be hosting a 
      roundtable discussion entitled "Digital Power:&nbsp; Ready for Prime 
      Time?" in which I will be discussing the current state of digital power 
      technologies with panelists Dave Freeman, systems engineering manager at 
      Texas Instruments; Jim Templeton, founder and vice president of marketing 
      at Zilker Labs; Geoff Potter, vice president of Astec; and Phillip Roux, 
      power systems manager at EMC. Howard Abramowitz from Systel will moderate 
      the session. Given the rapid pace of technology development in this 
      segment and the keen interest in deploying systems that realize the 
      advantages these architectures offer, I expect a lively session and look 
      forward to seeing you there.</p>
