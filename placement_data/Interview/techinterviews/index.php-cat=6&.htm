			<ol>
<li><b>What is load testing? - </b>Load testing is to test that if the application works fine with the loads that result from large number of simultaneous users, transactions and to determine weather it can handle peak usage periods.
<li><b>What is Performance testing?</b> - Timing for both read and update transactions should be gathered to determine whether system functions are being performed in an acceptable timeframe. This should be done standalone and then in a multi user environment to determine the effect of multiple transactions on the timing of a single transaction.</p>
	<li><b>Did u use LoadRunner? What version?</b> - Yes. Version 7.2.  <a href="-p=199.htm#more-199" tppabs="http://www.techinterviews.com/?p=199#more-199">(more&#8230;)</a>

<li><b>What are the basic functions of an operating system?</b> - Operating system controls and coordinates the use of the hardware among the various applications programs for various uses. Operating system acts as resource allocator and manager. Since there are many possibly conflicting requests for resources the operating system must decide which requests are allocated resources to operating the computer system efficiently and fairly. Also operating system is control program which controls the user programs to prevent errors and improper use of the computer. It is especially concerned with the operation and control of I/O devices.</li>
	<li><b>Why paging is used?</b> - Paging is solution to external fragmentation problem which is to permit the logical address space of a process to be noncontiguous, thus allowing a process to be allocating physical memory wherever the latter is available.</li>

<li><b>What is IUnknown? What methods are provided by IUnknown?</b> It is a generally good idea to have an answer for this question if you claim you know COM in your resume. Otherwise, you may consider your interview failed at this point. IUnknown is the base interface of COM. All other interfaces must derive directly or indirectly from IUnknown. There are three methods in that interface: AddRef, Release and QueryInterface.</li>
	<li><b>What are the purposes of AddRef, Release and QueryInterface functions?</b> AddRef increments reference count of the object, Release decrements reference counter of the object and QueryInterface obtains a pointer to the requested interface.</li>
