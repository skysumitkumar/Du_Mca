			<ol>
<li><b>What is presentation layer responsible for in the OSI model?</b> The presentation layer establishes the data format prior to passing it along to the network application&#8217;s interface. TCP/IP networks perform this task at the application layer.</li>
<a id="more-13"></a>
<li><b>Does Windows Server 2003 support IPv6?</b> Yes, run ipv6.exe from command line to disable it.</li>
	<li><b>Can Windows Server 2003 function as a bridge?</b> Yes, and it&#8217;s a new feature for the 2003 product. You can combine several networks and devices connected via several adapters by enabling IP routing.</li>
	<li><b>What&#8217;s the difference between the basic disk and dynamic disk?</b> The basic type contains partitions, extended partitions, logical drivers, and an assortment of static volumes; the dynamic type does not use partitions but dynamically manages volumes and provides advanced storage options</li>
	<li><b>What&#8217;s a media pool?</b> It is any compilation of disks or tapes with the same administrative properties.&nbsp;</li>
	<li><b>How do you install recovery console?</b> <font face="Courier New">C:\i386\win32 /cmdcons</font>, assuming that your Win server installation is on drive C.</li>
	<li><b>What&#8217;s new in Terminal Services for Windows 2003 Server?</b> Supports audio transmissions as well, although prepare for heavy network load.</li>
	<li><b>What scripts ship with IIS 6.0?</b> <i> iisweb.vsb</i> to create, delete, start, stop, and list Web sites, <i> iisftp.vsb</i> to create, delete, start, stop, and list FTP sites, <i> iisdir.vsb</i> to create, delete, start, stop, and display virtual directories, <i> iisftpdr.vsb</i> to create, delete, start, stop, and display virtual directories under an FTP root, <i> iiscnfg.vbs</i> to export and import IIS configuration to an XML file.</li>
	<li><b>What&#8217;s the name of the user who connects to the Web site anonymously?</b> IUSR_computername</li>
	<li><b>What secure authentication and encryption mechanisms are supported by IIS 6.0?</b> Basic authentication, Digest authentication, Advanced digest authentication, Certificate-based Web transactions that use PKCS #7/PKCS #10, Fortezza, SSL, Server-Gated Cryptography, Transport Layer Security</li>
	<li><b>What&#8217;s the relation between SSL and TLS?</b> Transport Layer Security (TLS) extends SSL by providing cryptographic authentication.&nbsp;</li>
	<li><b>What&#8217;s the role of http.sys in IIS?</b> It is the point of contact for all incoming HTTP requests. It listens for requests and queues them until they are all processed, no more queues are available, or the Web server is shut down.</li>
	<li><b>Where&#8217;s ASP cache located on IIS 6.0?</b> On disk, as opposed to memory, as it used to be in IIS 5.</li>
	<li><b>What is socket pooling?</b> Non-blocking socket usage, introduced in IIS 6.0. More than one application can use a given socket.</li>
	<li><b>Describe the process of clustering with Windows 2003 Server when a new node is added.</b> As a node goes online, it searches for other nodes to join by polling the designated internal network. In this way, all nodes are notified of the new node&#8217;s existence. If other nodes cannot be found on a preexisting cluster, the new node takes control of the quorum resources residing on the shared disk that contains state and configuration data.</li>
	<li><b>What applications are not capable of performing in Windows 2003 Server clusters?</b> The ones written exclusively for NetBEUI and IPX.</li>
	<li><b>What&#8217;s a heartbeat?</b> Communication processes between the nodes designed to ensure node&#8217;s health.</li>
	<li><b>What&#8217;s a threshold in clustered environment?</b> The number of times a restart is attempted, when the node fails.</li>
	<li><b>You need to change and admin password on a clustered Windows box, but that requires rebooting the cluster, doesn&#8217;t it?</b> No, it doesn&#8217;t. In 2003 environment you can do that via cluster.exe utility which does not require rebooting the entire cluster.</li>
	<li><b>For the document of size 1 MB, what size would you expect the index to be with Indexing Service?</b> 150-300 KB, 15-30% is a reasonable expectation.</li>
	<li><b>Doesn&#8217;t the Indexing Service introduce a security flaw when allowing access to the index?</b> No, because users can only view the indices of documents and folders that they have permissions for.</li>
	<li><b>What&#8217;s the typical size of the index?</b> Less then 100K documents - up to 128 MB. More than that - 256+ MB.</li>
	<li><b>Which characters should be enclosed in quotes when searching the index?</b> &amp;, @, $, #, ^, ( ), and |.</li>
	<li><b>How would you search for C++?</b> Just enter C++, since + is not a special character (and neither is C).</li>
	<li><b>What about Barnes&amp;Noble?</b> Should be searched for as Barnes&#8217;&amp;&#8217;Noble.</li>
	<li><b>Are the searches case-sensitive?</b> No.</li>
	<li><b>What&#8217;s the order of precedence of Boolean operators in Microsoft Windows 2003 Server Indexing Service?</b> NOT, AND, NEAR, OR.</li>
	<li><b>What&#8217;s a vector space query?</b> A multiple-word query where the weight can be assigned to each of the search words. For example, if you want to fight information on &#8216;black hole&#8217;, but would prefer to give more weight to the word hole, you can enter <i>black[1] hole[20]</i> into the search window.</li>
	<li><b>What&#8217;s a response queue?</b> It&#8217;s the message queue that holds response messages sent from the receiving application to the sender.</li>
	<li><b>What&#8217;s <i>MQPing</i> used for?</b> Testing Microsoft Message Queue services between the nodes on a network.</li>
	<li><b>Which add-on package for Windows 2003 Server would you use to monitor the installed software and license compliance?</b> SMS (System Management Server).</li>
