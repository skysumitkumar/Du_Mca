		<h3><a href="-p=146.htm" tppabs="http://www.techinterviews.com/?p=146" rel="bookmark" title="Interview questions: Junior Java programmer interview questions">Junior Java programmer interview questions</a></h3>
			<ol>
<li><b>What is the purpose of finalization?</b> - The purpose of finalization is to give an unreachable object the opportunity to perform any cleanup processing before the object is garbage collected.</li>
	<li><b>What is the difference between the Boolean &#038; operator and the &#038;&#038; operator?</b> - If an expression involving the Boolean &#038; operator is evaluated, both operands are evaluated. Then the &#038; operator is applied to the operand. When an expression involving the &#038;&#038; operator is evaluated, the first operand is evaluated. If the first operand returns a value of true then the second operand is evaluated. The &#038;&#038; operator is then applied to the first and second operands. If the first operand evaluates to false, the evaluation of the second operand is skipped.</li>
<a id="more-146"></a></p>
	<li><b>How many times may an object&#8217;s finalize() method be invoked by the garbage collector?</b> - An object&#8217;s finalize() method may only be invoked once by the garbage collector.</li>
	<li><b>What is the purpose of the finally clause of a try-catch-finally statement?</b> - The finally clause is used to provide the capability to execute code no matter whether or not an exception is thrown or caught.</li>
	<li><b>What is the argument type of a program&#8217;s main() method?</b> - A program&#8217;s main() method takes an argument of the String[] type.</li>
	<li><b>Which Java operator is right associative?</b> - The = operator is right associative.</li>
	<li><b>Can a double value be cast to a byte?</b> - Yes, a double value can be cast to a byte.</li>
	<li><b>What is the difference between a break statement and a continue statement?</b> - A break statement results in the termination of the statement to which it applies (switch, for, do, or while). A continue statement is used to end the current loop iteration and return control to the loop statement.</li>
	<li><b>What must a class do to implement an interface?</b> - It must provide all of the methods in the interface and identify the interface in its implements clause.</li>
	<li><b>What is the advantage of the event-delegation model over the earlier event-inheritance model?</b> - The event-delegation model has two advantages over the event-inheritance model. First, it enables event handling to be handled by objects other than the ones that generate the events (or their containers). This allows a clean separation between a component&#8217;s design and its use. The other advantage of the event-delegation model is that it performs much better in applications where many events are generated. This performance improvement is due to the fact that the event-delegation model does not have to repeatedly process unhandled events, as is the case of the event-inheritance model.</li>
	<li><b>How are commas used in the intialization and iteration parts of a for statement?</b> - Commas are used to separate multiple statements within the initialization and iteration parts of a for statement.</li>
	<li><b>What is an abstract method?</b> - An abstract method is a method whose implementation is deferred to a subclass.</li>
	<li><b>What value does read() return when it has reached the end of a file?</b> - The read() method returns -1 when it has reached the end of a file.</li>
	<li><b>Can a Byte object be cast to a double value?</b> - No, an object cannot be cast to a primitive value.</li>
	<li><b>What is the difference between a static and a non-static inner class?</b> - A non-static inner class may have object instances that are associated with instances of the class&#8217;s outer class. A static inner class does not have any object instances.</li>
	<li><b>If a variable is declared as private, where may the variable be accessed?</b> - A private variable may only be accessed within the class in which it is declared.</li>
	<li><b>What is an object&#8217;s lock and which object&#8217;s have locks?</b> - An object&#8217;s lock is a mechanism that is used by multiple threads to obtain synchronized access to the object. A thread may execute a synchronized method of an object only after it has acquired the object&#8217;s lock. All objects and classes have locks.

		<p>I found this site while searching for java/j2ee faq. The faq made available at this site are very much useful to both beginners as well as experienced people. Beginners will benefit in their interviews and experienced people will benefit to get clarifications on most of issues.<br />
I am very much thankful to the team for their valuable effort.

		<p>These are interesting questions. I consider myself to be an experienced java programmer, but in fact I knew the answers to less than half of these questions! They are really poking around in various nitty-gritty technical aspects of java.</p>
	<p>I suppose the more experience you have with java, the more likely you are to encounter these issues, and therefore know the answers to these questions, but I think I would ask a different type of question if I was an interviewer. Especially if you&#8217;re looking for a *junior* java developer
