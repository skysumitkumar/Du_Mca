			<ol>
<li><b>What is a Marker Interface?</b> - An interface with no methods. Example: Serializable, Remote, Cloneable</li>
	<li><b>What interface do you implement to do the sorting?</b> - Comparable</li>
	<li><b>What is the eligibility for a object to get cloned?</b> - It must implement the Cloneable interface</li>
<a id="more-143"></a></p>
	<li><b>What is the purpose of abstract class? </b> - It is  not an instantiable class. It provides the concrete implementation for some/all the methods. So that they can reuse the concrete functionality by inheriting the abstract class.</li>
	<li><b>What is the difference between interface and abstract class?</b> - Abstract class defined with methods. Interface will declare only the methods. Abstract classes are very much useful when there is a some functionality across various classes. Interfaces are well suited for the classes which varies in functionality but with the same method signatures.</li>
	<li><b>What do you mean by RMI and how it is useful?</b> - RMI is a remote method invocation. Using RMI, you can work with remote object. The function calls are as though you are invoking a local variable. So it gives you a impression that you are working really with a object that resides within your own JVM though it is somewhere.</li>
	<li><b>What is the protocol used by RMI?</b> - RMI-IIOP</li>
	<li><b>What is a hashCode?</b> - hash code value for this object which is unique for every object.</li>
	<li><b>What is a thread?</b> - Thread is a block of code which can execute concurrently with other threads in the JVM.</li>
	<li><b>What is the algorithm used in Thread scheduling?</b> - Fixed priority scheduling.</li>
	<li><b>What is hash-collision in Hashtable and how it is handled in Java?</b> - Two different keys with the same hash value. Two different entries will be kept in a single hash bucket to avoid the collision.</li>
	<li><b>What are the different driver types available in JDBC?</b> - 1. A JDBC-ODBC bridge 2. A native-API partly Java technology-enabled driver 3. A net-protocol fully Java technology-enabled driver 4. A native-protocol fully Java technology-enabled driver For more information: Driver Description</li>
	<li><b>Is JDBC-ODBC bridge multi-threaded?</b> - No</li>
	<li><b>Does the JDBC-ODBC Bridge support multiple concurrent open statements per connection?</b> - No</li>
	<li><b>What is the use of serializable?</b> - To persist the state of an object into any perminant storage device.</li>
	<li><b>What is the use of transient?</b> - It is an indicator to the JVM that those variables should not be persisted. It is the users responsibility to initialize the value when read back from the storage.</li>
	<li><b>What are the different level lockings using the synchronization keyword?</b> - Class level lock Object level lock Method level lock Block level lock</li>
	<li><b>What is the use of preparedstatement?</b> - Preparedstatements are precompiled statements. It is mainly used to speed up the process of inserting/updating/deleting especially when there is a bulk processing.</li>
	<li><b>What is callable statement? Tell me the way to get the callable statement?</b> - Callablestatements are used to invoke the stored procedures. You can obtain the callablestatement from Connection using the following methods prepareCall(String sql) prepareCall(String sql, int resultSetType, int resultSetConcurrency) </li>
	<li><b>In a statement, I am executing a batch. What is the result of the execution?</b> - It returns the int array. The array contains the affected row count in the corresponding index of the SQL.</li>
	<li><b>Can a abstract method have the static qualifier?</b> - No</li>
	<li><b>What are the different types of qualifier and what is the default qualifier?</b> - public, protected, private, package (default)</li>
	<li><b>What is the super class of Hashtable?</b> - Dictionary</li>
	<li><b>What is a lightweight component?</b> - Lightweight components are the one which doesn&#8217;t go with the native call to obtain the graphical units. They share their parent component graphical units to render them. Example, Swing components</li>
	<li><b>What is a heavyweight component?</b> - For every paint call, there will be a native call to get the graphical units. Example, AWT.</li>

		<p>Answer 8 incorrect, also collides with answer 11. See String.hashCode()<br />
Answer 10 wrong IMO. Platform dependent.<br />
Answer 22 default is often referred to as friendly (see Bruce Eckel)<br />
Answer 26 maybe add sandbox info. Webstart makes the differentiation difficult<br />
Answer 27 using multiple classloaders -&gt; interesting for people using tomcat<br />
Answer 31 not complete / question incorrect :)<br />
Answer 32 I believe one can also write to a socket<br />
Answer 33 limitations of unsigned applets in the sandbox</p>
	<p>This addendum is not guaranteed to be correct and its only my opinion. The interviewer should have a clue about what he is asking, so I guess its ok to include technical information here
