  Either way it marks a Character boundary. Start from there an scan forward to 
  find what the last character is. 
  <LI>Flip adjacent bits, then flip adjacent 2 bit sets, then 4-bits and so on. 
  Each of this swap can be done in constant time using appropriate masks and 
  shifts.

  <P>
  <P>The technical interview is perhaps the most intimidating and mysterious 
  event that job hunters experience in the quest for that "killer offer." The 
  rigor and format of the technical interview varies from one company to the 
  next, but there are some fundamental similarities. An interviewer presents you 
  with a problem to be solved. The interviewer may leave the room and give you 
  some time to work the solution out before returning. Or the interviewer may 
  wait patiently while you study the problem and figure it out. The interviewer 
  may even start quizzing you right away about aspects of the problem and 
  approaches to solving it. Some of these problems can appear quite challenging, 
  especially if you've never been through a technical interview before. To make 
  matters worse, simply getting the answer to the problem may not be enough to 
  land the job. On the other hand, getting the correct answer may not even be 
  necessary. What is an interviewer looking for in candidates during the 
  technical interview? Interviewers recognize that this setting is, by its very 
  nature, stressful. Otherwise competent candidates may be completely stumped by 
  an interview problem only to discover an elegant, simple solution later that 
  night. Interviewers may be interested in seeing how you work under stressful 
  situations or how well you adapt. It is worth noting that interviewers are 
  more interested in seeing how you work than seeing whether you can come up 
  with the correct answer. In this article, I will deal with both how you can 
  better showcase your skills and experience, and what kinds of problems you can 
  expect to be asked. <BR><IMG

  <LI><B>The Basic Rules </B></A>
  <P>
  <P>These basic rules are often taught to programmers and are (or at any rate, 
  should be) drilled into your head in computer-science classes. For some 
  reason, however, they are easily forgotten during the technical interview. 
  Being one of the few candidates careful and experienced enough to remember 
  these important steps can make the difference between getting an offer and 
  getting the cold shoulder. Don't be afraid to ask for clarifications of the 
  problem or the requirements for the solution. <BR><IMG

  <P><A name=q3></P>
  <LI><B>Don't assume all data is given to you. </B></A>
  <P>
  <P>You should never assume that you have been given all the data necessary to 
  solve the problem to the satisfaction of the interviewer. This is especially 
  likely to be the case when interviewing with IT consulting companies. In this 
  environment, the client may need some prodding in order to provide a complete 
  specification. So, the reasoning goes, ideal candidates will be willing to 
  talk to the client to figure out the expected inputs, the desired outputs, the 
  data ranges and data types, and the special cases. The ideal candidate will 
  ask these questions rather than spend all the allotted time coming up with a 
  solution that doesn't meet the client's needs. The first thing to do, then, is 
  to make sure that you and the interviewer agree on what the problem is and 
  what an acceptable solution would be. Make all of your assumptions explicit 
  and up-front, so the interviewer can correct you if you are mistaken. <BR><IMG 
  src="Sample Interview Questions_files/bann01.gif"> 
  <P><A name=q4></P>
  <LI><B>Think out loud. </B></A>
  <P>
  <P>If the interviewer stays in the room after presenting the problem, he or 
  she is interested in seeing how you analyze and approach a problem. Of 
  interest are how possible solutions are considered and eliminated. And 
  frankly, watching a candidate sit and stare at a problem isn't all that 
  entertaining for the interviewer. Always allow sufficient time for design. The 
  worst thing that you can do while attempting to solve a technical problem is 
  to dive right into coding a solution and get about half way through it before 
  realizing that the approach is all wrong. This is where a little forethought 
  can save a great deal of effort and embarrassment. Don't worry about running 
  out of time to answer the question before finishing the code for the solution. 
  The idea, the algorithm, and the approach are the most important elements 
  here. If you're having trouble writing the code, offer to explain the 
  algorithm. Stress and anxiety can make the technical interview more difficult 
  than it needs to be. If you find yourself having difficulty with programming 
  syntax or constructs, you should make sure that the interviewer knows that you 
  understand the problem and its solution. While it's best to get both the 
  algorithm and the implementation correct, it's far better to get points for 
  demonstrating facility with one than fail to demonstrate either. Be prepared 
  to identify bottlenecks, possible optimizations, and alternative algorithms. 
  Just because you've found one solution that produces the correct output, 
  doesn't mean the problem has been solved to the interviewer's satisfaction. 
  Interviewers, hinting at possible improvements, may prod you at this point. 
  Occasionally, you may take an approach that the interviewer didn't anticipate. 
  At this point, an interviewer may ask you to take a more conventional 
  approach. This doesn't mean that you've done anything wrong; very often, an 
  interviewer may be leading you along a particular approach with a purpose in 
  mind. The interviewer may be intending to ask follow-up questions or present 
  new problems that build on a particular solution. <BR><IMG

  <LI><B>Good programming practice. </B></A>
  <P>
  <P>Initialize all variables, give variables descriptive names, and always use 
  comments. 
  <P>Interviewers may be watching your solutions to determine whether you follow 
  good programming practices. Good programming practices make it easy to 
  understand other people's code. This means that there aren't cryptic 
  variables, functions with undocumented side effects, obfuscated algorithms, 
  and sloppy (read: buggy) code. Just because you are being interviewed (and 
  therefore, coding on a whiteboard or on a piece of paper) doesn't give you an 
  excuse to be sloppy or lazy. Commenting code for an interview may seem like a 
  waste of time, but some interviewers do look to see that candidates write 
  comments while coding or before coding, rather than adding them in as an 
  afterthought. <BR><IMG src="Sample Interview Questions_files/bann01.gif"> 
  <P><A name=q6></P>
  <LI><B>Check all boundary conditions. </B></A>
  <P>
  <P>Candidates forget to do this frighteningly often. In fact, practicing 
  programmers sometimes forget to do this. That's how bugs get started. You 
  should verify that your code properly handles cases where inputs are negative 
  or zero, lists are empty, strings are empty, and pointers are NULL. This is 
  also a good habit to have after you get the job. Expect bad input from users. 
  Users rarely do as they are expected. You should protect your code, and return 
  a descriptive error back to the user. Display enthusiasm. Don't underestimate 
  the importance of your appearance and attitude during the interview. While 
  your skills and experience may be the focus of the technical interview, 
  looking bored or uninterested may do more to sabotage your chances than 
  blowing an interview problem. <BR><IMG

  <LI><B>Work Things Into Your Conversations </B></A>
  <P>
  <P>In addition to these basic rules for the technical interview, there are 
  some other things worth pointing out. Interviewers don't always have the 
  chance to examine your rsum in advance. This means that the interviewer may 
  not be aware of your past work experience. Don't hesitate to point out 
  experiences working in teams (whether as a part of a past job, a class 
  programming project, or a hobby), working on large projects (paying attention 
  to time spent on design, implementation, and testing), dealing with customers 
  to define requirements, and managing people and projects. Interviewers are 
  interested in hearing about successes as well as failures. When these past 
  experiences weren't successful, you should point out the lessons learned or 
  wisdom gained as a result of these failures. Interviewers want to see that 
  candidates who have had negative experiences are not going to repeat their 
  mistakes. <BR><IMG src="Sample Interview Questions_files/bann01.gif"> 
  <P><A name=q8></P>
  <LI><B>Typical Technical Questions </B></A>
  <P>
  <P>When preparing for a technical interview, you should review basic 
  structures (linked lists, binary trees, heaps) and algorithms (searching, 
  sorting, hashing). Having a mastery of these topics will likely give you all 
  the necessary knowledge to tackle the problems you will encounter during the 
  technical interview. Also, review the areas for which you're interviewing. If 
  you're interviewing for a systems programming job, review the differences 
  between threads and processes, OS scheduling algorithms, and memory 
  allocation. If you're interviewing for a job that requires experience with an 
  object- oriented language, spend some time brushing up on object-oriented 
  methodology. 
  <P>Fortunately, some of the same problems come up with surprising frequency. 
  Even if a given interviewer doesn't use any of the problems I present here, 
  studying them should give you insight into solving other problems. <BR><IMG

  <LI><B>Conclusion </B></A>
  <P>
  <P>The specific details of your interview will, of course, depend on a number 
  of factors -- the type of job you are applying for, the needs and expertise of 
  the technical interviewer, and guidelines set forth by the organization 
  seeking to hire you. Still, if you generalize and apply the tips I've 
  presented here, you should be well on your way to getting the programming job 
  that you want. <BR><IMG src="Sample Interview Questions_files/bann01.gif">

  <P>The cut (plane) should pass through the center of the two rectangles: the

  <LI><B>How many points are there on the globe where by walking one mile south, 
  one mile east and one mile north you reach the place where you started. 
  </B></A>
  <P>
  <P>The answer is "many points". The set of such points is given as {North 
  pole, special circle}. 
  <P>From north pole, walking one mile south followed by one mile east still 
  keeps you one mile south of North pole. 
  <P>The special circle consists of a set of points defined as follows. Let's 
  say you were to locate a spot near the South Pole where the circular distance 
  "around" the Earth's North-South axis is 1 mile. The path of such a journey 
  would create a circle with a radius of approximately 840.8 feet (because 
  C=2.r.pi). Call this point X. Now consider another point Y one mile north of 
  X. The special circle is the circular path around North-South axis going 
  through Y. If you begin you journey from any point (say Y1) on this special 
  circle, and travel one mile south, you get to a point (say X1) on the circle 
  of point X. Now one mile east will bring you back to X1, because circumference 
  of circle of X is 1 mile. Then one mile North brings you back to Y1. (Answer

  <P>The answer is that you need to store all possible configurations of the

  accessing the right element and getting the corresponding move for it. Do some 
  analysis and do some more optimization in storage since otherwise it becomes

  <P>Example 2 contains both the iterative and recursive solutions. The

  defined as 0. The first number in the sequence is 1. Return -1 if a negative 
  number is passed. 
  <P>The recursive version of the Fibonacci function works correctly, but is 
  considerably more expensive than the iterative version. There are, however, 
  other ways to write this function recursively in C that are not as expensive. 
  For instance, you could maintain static variables or create a struct to hold 
  previously computed results. <BR><IMG

  <P>
  <P>Given a char pointer, strlen() determines the number of chars in a string. 
  The first thing that your strlen() implementation ought to do is to check your 
  boundary conditions. Don't forget the case where the pointer you are given is 
  pointing to an empty string. What about the case where the pointer is equal to 
  NULL? This is a case where you should state your assumptions. In many 
  implementations, the real strlen() doesn't check to see if the pointer is 
  NULL, so passing a NULL pointer to strlen() would result in a segmentation 
  fault. Making it clear to your interviewer that you are aware of both of these 
  boundary conditions shows that you understand the problem and that you have 
  thought about its solution carefully. Example 3 shows the correct solution.

  <P>
  <P>You are presented with a linked list, which may have a "loop" in it. That

  list. Devise an algorithm to detect whether a loop exists in a linked list. 
  How does your answer change if you cannot change the structure of the list 
  elements? 
  <P>One possible answer is to add a flag to each element of the list. You could 
  then traverse the list, starting at the head and tagging each element as you 
  encounter it. If you ever encountered an element that was already tagged, you 
  would know that you had already visited it and that there existed a loop in 
  the linked list. What if you are not allowed to alter the structure of the 
  elements of the linked list? The following algorithm will find the loop: 
  <P>
  <OL>
    <LI>Start with two pointers ptr1 and ptr2. 
    <LI>Set ptr1 and ptr2 to the head of the linked list. 
    <LI>Traverse the linked list with ptr1 moving twice as fast as ptr2 (for

    element). 
    <LI>Stop when ptr1 reaches the end of the list, or when ptr1 = ptr2. 
    <LI>If ptr1 and ptr2 are ever equal, then there must be a loop in the linked 
    list. If the linked list has no loops, ptr1 should reach the end of the 
    linked list ahead of ptr2. </LI></OL><BR><IMG

  <P>The important realization for this problem is that the hour hand is always

  <LI><B>Devise an algorithm for detecting whether a given string is a 
  palindrome (spelled the same way forwards and backwards). For example, "A man,

  <P>
  <P>For the sake of this problem, assume that the string has been stripped of 
  punctuation (including spaces), and has been converted to a single case. The 
  most efficient way to detect whether a string is a palindrome is to create two 
  pointers. Set one at the beginning of the string, and one at the end. Compare 
  the values at those locations. If the values don't match, the string isn't a 
  palindrome. Otherwise, move each pointer inward and repeat the comparison. 
  Stop when the pointers are pointing to the same position in the string (if its 
  length is an odd-number) or when the pointers have "crossed" (if the string's 
  length is an even-number). Example 5 shows the correct solution. <BR><IMG

  <LI><B>Given an eight-bit bitmap graphics file, devise an algorithm to convert

  <P>
  <P>Assume that the file format is one byte for every pixel in the file, and 
  that the approximation will produce one ASCII character of output for each 
  pixel. This problem is easier to solve than it sounds. This is one of the 
  tricks used in technical interview questions. Problems may be obscured or made 
  to sound difficult. Don't be fooled! Take the time to think about the core of 
  the problem. In this case, all you want is an algorithm for reading the values 
  in a file and outputting characters based upon those values. 
  <P>Eight-bit numbers can be in the range from 0 to 255. Two-bit numbers are in 
  the range from 0 to 3. Basically, we want to divide the 256 numbers specified 
  by an eight-bit number into four ranges, which can be indicated by a two-bit 
  number. So, divide the range of 0 to 255 uniformly into four separate ranges: 
  0 to 63, 64 to 127, 128 to 191, and 192 to 255. 
  <P>You then have to assign an ASCII character to each of those four ranges of 
  numbers. For example, you could use "_", "~", "+", and "#". Then, the 
  algorithm is as follows: <PRE>1.	Open the file.
2.	For every byte in the file:
a.	Read in one byte.
b.	If the value is in the range 0..63, we'll print '_'.
c.	If the value is in the range 64..127, we'll print '~'.
d.	If the value is in the range 128..191, we'll print '+'.
e.	If the value is in the range 192..255, we'll print '#'.
3.	Close the file.

  <P>
  <P>A Casting is a mechanism built into C that allows the programmer to force

  <P><A name=q156></P>
  <LI><B>List C's storage classes and what they signify. </B></A>
  <P>
  <P>static - Variables are defined in a nonvolatile region of memory such that 
  they retain their contents though out the program's execution. 
  <P>register - Asks the compiler to devote a processor register to this 
  variable in order to speed the program's execution. The compiler may not 
  comply and the variable looses it contents and identity when the function it 
  which it is defined terminates. 
  <P>extern - Tells the compiler that the variable is defined in another module. 

  <P>volatile - Tells the compiler that other programs will be modifying this 
  variable in addition to the program being compiled. For example, an I/O device 
  might need write directly into a program or data space. Meanwhile, the program 
  itself may never directly access the memory area in question. In such a case, 
  we would not want the compiler to optimize-out this data area that never seems 
  to be used by the program, yet must exist for the program to function 
  correctly in a larger context. <BR><IMG

  <LI><B>With respect to function parameter passing, what is the difference 
  between call-by-value and call-by-reference? Which method does C use? </B></A>
  <P>
  <P>In the case of call-by-reference, a pointer reference to a variable is 
  passed into a function instead of the actual value. The function's operations 
  will effect the variable in a global as well as local sense. Call-by-value 
  (C's method of parameter passing), by contrast, passes a copy of the 
  variable's value into the function. Any changes to the variable made by 
  function have only a local effect and do not alter the state of the variable 
  passed into the function. <BR><IMG

  <LI><B>What is a structure and a union in C? </B></A>
  <P>
  <P>A structure is an aggregate data type. It combines one or more base or 
  aggregate data types into a package that may treated as a whole. A structure 
  is like a record in other languages. A union combines two or more data types 
  in the same area of storage. The contents of a union may be one data type at 
  one time and another type at a different time. A union is sometimes called a 
  trick- record. <BR><IMG src="Sample Interview Questions_files/bann01.gif">

  <P>They both specify a file for inclusion into the current source file. The 
  difference is where the file stdio.h is expected to be. In the case of the

  defined before it can be used. There are rare occasions where this is not 
  possible. It is possible (and sometimes necessary) to define two functions in 
  terms of each other. One will obey the cardinal rule while the other will need

  <P>
  <P>Polymorphism refers to the ability of an object to respond in a logically

  of objects. Consider 1 + 5 and 1 + 5.1. In the former, the message "+ 5" is 
  sent to an object of class integer (1). In the later, the message "+ 5.1" is 
  sent to the same integer object. The form of the message (its protocol) is 
  identical in both cases. What differs is the type of object on the right-hand 
  side of these messages. The former is an integer object (5) while the later is 
  a floating point object (5.1). The receiver (1) appears (to other objects) to 
  respond in the same way to both messages. Internally, however, it knows that 
  it must treat the two types of objects differently in order to obtain the same

  <LI><B>Contrast procedural and object oriented programming. </B></A>
  <P>
  <P>The procedural paradigm performs computation through a step-by-step 
  manipulation of data items. Solving problems this way is akin to writing a 
  recipe. ie: All the ingredients (data items) are defined. Next a series of 
  enumerated steps (statements) are defined to transform the raw ingredients 
  into a finished meal. 
  <P>The object oriented model, in contrast, combines related data and 
  procedural information into a single package called an object. Objects are 
  meant to represent logically separate entities (like real world objects). 
  Objects are grouped together (and defined by) classes. (This is analogous to 
  user defined data types in procedural languages.) Classes may pass-on their 
  "makeup" to classes derived from them. In this way, Objects that are of a 
  similar yet different nature need not be defined from scratch. Computation 
  occurs though the intercommunication of objects. Programming this way is like 
  writing a play. First the characters are defined with their attributes and 
  personalities. Next the dialog is written so that the personalities interact.

  <P>The scope resolution operator permits a program to reference an identifier

  however. (Some readers had not heard the term, "scope resolution operator,"

  well into the design or use of classes that employ inheritance, you tend to 
  address overriding virtual function overrides to explicitly call a function 
  higher in the hierarchy. That's good knowledge to demonstrate, but address 
  your comments specifically to global scope resolution. Describe C++'s ability 
  to override the particular C behavior where identifiers in the global scope

  <LI><B>What are the differences between a C++ struct and C++ class? </B></A>
  <P>
  <P>The default member and base class access specifiers are different. 
  <P>This is one of the commonly misunderstood aspects of C++. Believe it or 
  not, many programmers think that a C++ struct is just like a C struct, while a 
  C++ class has inheritance, access specifiers, member functions, overloaded 
  operators, and so on. Some of them have even written books about C++. 
  Actually, the C++ struct has all the features of the class. The only 
  differences are that a struct defaults to public member access and public base 
  class inheritance, and a class defaults to the private access specifier and 
  private base class inheritance. Getting this question wrong does not 
  necessarily disqualify you because you will be in plenty of good company. 
  Getting it right is a definite plus. <BR><IMG

  <LI><B>How many ways are there to initialize an int with a constant? </B></A>
  <P>
  <P>Two. 
  <P>There are two formats for initializers in C++ as shown in Example 1. 
  Example 1(a) uses the traditional C notation, while Example 1(b) uses 
  constructor notation. Many programmers do not know about the notation in 
  Example 1(b), although they should certainly know about the first one. Many 
  old-timer C programmers who made the switch to C++ never use the second idiom, 
  although some wise heads of C++ profess to prefer it. 
  <P>A reader wrote to tell me of two other ways, as shown in Examples 2(a) and 
  2(b), which made me think that maybe the answer could be extended even further 
  to include the initialization of an int function parameter with a constant 
  argument from the caller. <BR><IMG

  <P><A name=q224></P>
  <LI><B>How does throwing and catching exceptions differ from using setjmp and 
  longjmp? </B></A>
  <P>
  <P>The throw operation calls the destructors for automatic objects 
  instantiated since entry to the try block. 
  <P>Exceptions are in the mainstream of C++ now, so most programmers, if they 
  are familiar with setjmp and longjmp, should know the difference. Both idioms 
  return a program from the nested depths of multiple function calls to a 
  defined position higher in the program. The program stack is "unwound" so that 
  the state of the program with respect to function calls and pushed arguments 
  is restored as if the calls had not been made. C++ exception handling adds to 
  that behavior the orderly calls to the destructors of automatic objects that 
  were instantiated as the program proceeded from within the try block toward 
  where the throw expression is evaluated. 
  <P>It's okay to discuss the notational differences between the two idioms. 
  Explain the syntax of try blocks, catch exception handlers, and throw 
  expressions. Then specifically address what happens in a throw that does not 
  happen in a longjmp. Your answer should reflect an understanding of the 
  behavior described in the answer just given. 
  <P>One valid reason for not knowing about exception handling is that your 
  experience is exclusively with older C++ compilers that do not implement 
  exception handling. I would prefer that you have at least heard of exception 
  handling, though. 
  <P>It is not unusual for C and C++ programmers to be unfamiliar with setjmp/ 
  longjmp. Those constructs are not particularly intuitive. A C programmer who 
  has written recursive descent parsing algorithms will certainly be familiar 
  with setjmp/ longjmp. Others might not, and that's acceptable. In that case, 
  you won't be able to discuss how setjmp/longjmp differs from C++ exception 
  handling, but let the interview turn into a discussion of C++ exception 
  handling in general. That conversation will reveal to the interviewer a lot 
  about your overall understanding of C++. <BR><IMG

  <P><A name=q225></P>
  <LI><B>What is your reaction to this line of code? <PRE>delete this;</PRE></B></A>
  <P>
  <P>It's not a good practice. 
  <P>A good programmer will insist that the statement is never to be used if the 
  class is to be used by other programmers and instantiated as static, extern, 
  or automatic objects. That much should be obvious. 
  <P>The code has two built-in pitfalls. First, if it executes in a member 
  function for an extern, static, or automatic object, the program will probably 
  crash as soon as the delete statement executes. There is no portable way for 
  an object to tell that it was instantiated on the heap, so the class cannot 
  assert that its object is properly instantiated. Second, when an object 
  commits suicide this way, the using program might not know about its demise. 
  As far as the instantiating program is concerned, the object remains in scope 
  and continues to exist even though the object did itself in. Subsequent 
  dereferencing of the pointer can and usually does lead to disaster. 
  <P>A reader pointed out that a class can ensure that its objects are 
  instantiated on the heap by making its destructor private. This idiom 
  necessitates a kludgy DeleteMe kind of function because the instantiator 
  cannot call the delete operator for objects of the class. The DeleteMe 
  function would then use "delete this." 
  <P>I got a lot of mail about this issue. Many programmers believe that delete 
  this is a valid construct. In my experience, classes that use delete this when 
  objects are instantiated by users usually spawn bugs related to the idiom, 
  most often when a program dereferences a pointer to an object that has already 
  deleted itself. <BR><IMG src="Sample Interview Questions_files/bann01.gif">

  <LI><B>What is a default constructor? </B></A>
  <P>
  <P>A constructor that has no arguments or one where all the arguments have 
  default argument values. 
  <P>If you don't code a default constructor, the compiler provides one if there 
  are no other constructors. If you are going to instantiate an array of objects 
  of the class, the class must have a default constructor. <BR><IMG

  <LI><B>What is a conversion constructor? </B></A>
  <P>
  <P>A constructor that accepts one argument of a different type. 
  <P>The compiler uses this idiom as one way to infer conversion rules for a 
  class. A constructor with more than one argument and with default argument 
  values can be interpreted by the compiler as a conversion constructor when the 
  compiler is looking for an object of the type and sees an object of the type 
  of the constructor's first argument. <BR><IMG

  <P><A name=q228></P>
  <LI><B>What is the difference between a copy constructor and an overloaded 
  assignment operator? </B></A>
  <P>
  <P>A copy constructor constructs a new object by using the content of the 
  argument object. An overloaded assignment operator assigns the contents of an 
  existing object to another existing object of the same class. 
  <P>First, you must know that a copy constructor is one that has only one 
  argument, which is a reference to the same type as the constructor. The 
  compiler invokes a copy constructor wherever it needs to make a copy of the 
  object, for example to pass an argument by value. If you do not provide a copy 
  constructor, the compiler creates a member-by-member copy constructor for you. 

  <P>You can write overloaded assignment operators that take arguments of other 
  classes, but that behavior is usually implemented with implicit conversion 
  constructors. If you do not provide an overloaded assignment operator for the 
  class, the compiler creates a default member-by-member assignment operator. 
  <P>This discussion is a good place to get into why classes need copy 
  constructors and overloaded assignment operators. By discussing the 
  requirements with respect to data member pointers that point to dynamically 
  allocated resources, you demonstrate a good grasp of the problem. <BR><IMG

  <P>
  <P>There are three acceptable answers: "Never," "Rarely," and "When the 
  problem domain cannot be accurately modeled any other way." 
  <P>There are some famous C++ pundits and luminaries who disagree with that 
  third answer, so be careful. 
  <P>Let's digress to consider this issue lest your interview turn into a 
  religious debate. Consider an Asset class, Building class, Vehicle class, and 
  CompanyCar class. All company cars are vehicles. Some company cars are assets 
  because the organizations own them. Others might be leased. Not all assets are 
  vehicles. Money accounts are assets. Real-estate holdings are assets. Some 
  real-estate holdings are buildings. Not all buildings are assets. Ad 
  infinitum. When you diagram these relationships, it becomes apparent that 
  multiple inheritance is an intuitive way to model this common problem domain. 
  You should understand, however, that multiple inheritance, like a chainsaw, is 
  a useful tool that has its perils, needs respect, and is best avoided except 
  when nothing else will do. Stress this understanding because your interviewer

  <LI><B>What is a virtual destructor? </B></A>
  <P>
  <P>The simple answer is that a virtual destructor is one that is declared with 
  the virtual attribute. 
  <P>The behavior of a virtual destructor is what is important. If you destroy 
  an object through a pointer or reference to a base class, and the base-class 
  destructor is not virtual, the derived-class destructors are not executed, and 
  the destruction might not be complete. <BR><IMG

  <LI><B>Explain the ISA and HASA class relationships. How would you implement

  <P>
  <P>A specialized class "is a" specialization of another class and, therefore, 
  has the ISA relationship with the other class. An Employee ISA Person. This 
  relationship is best implemented with inheritance. Employee is derived from 
  Person. A class may have an instance of another class. For example, an 
  Employee "has a" Salary, therefore the Employee class has the HASA 
  relationship with the Salary class. This relationship is best implemented by 
  embedding an object of the Salary class in the Employee class. 
  <P>The answer to this question reveals whether you have an understanding of 
  the fundamentals of object-oriented design, which is important to reliable 
  class design. 
  <P>There are other relationships. The USESA relationship is when one class 
  uses the services of another. The Employee class uses an object (cout) of the 
  ostream class to display the employee's name onscreen, for example. But if you 
  get ISA and HASA right, you usually don't need to go any further. <BR><IMG

  <P>Prior to templates, you had to use inheritance; your design might include a 
  generic List container class and an application-specific Employee class. To 
  put employees in a list, a ListedEmployee class is multiply derived 
  (contrived) from the Employee and List classes. These solutions were unwieldy 
  and error-prone. Templates solved that problem. <BR><IMG

  <LI><B>What is the difference between C and C++ ? Would you prefer to use one 
  over the other ? </B></A>
  <P>
  <P>C is based on structured programming whereas C++ supports the 
  object-oriented programming paradigm.Due to the advantages inherent in 
  object-oriented programs such as modularity and reuse, C++ is preferred. 
  However almost anything that can be built using C++ can also be built using C.

  <LI><B>What are the access privileges in C++ ? What is the default access 
  level ? </B></A>
  <P>
  <P>The access privileges in C++ are private, public and protected. The default 
  access level assigned to members of a class is private. Private members of a 
  class are accessible only within the class and by friends of the class. 
  Protected members are accessible by the class itself and it's sub-classes. 
  Public members of a class can be accessed by anyone. <BR><IMG

  <LI><B>What is data encapsulation ? </B></A>
  <P>
  <P>Data Encapsulation is also known as data hiding. The most important 
  advantage of encapsulation is that it lets the programmer create an object and 
  then provide an interface to the object that other objects can use to call the 
  methods provided by the object. The programmer can change the internal 
  workings of an object but this transparent to other interfacing programs as 
  long as the interface remains unchanged. <BR><IMG

  <P><A name=q237></P>
  <LI><B>What is inheritance ? </B></A>
  <P>
  <P>Inheritance is the process of deriving classes from other classes. In such 
  a case, the sub-class has an 'is-a' relationship with the super class. For 
  e.g. vehicle can be a super-class and car can be a sub-class derived from 
  vehicle. In this case a car is a vehicle. The super class 'is not a' sub-class 
  as the sub- class is more specialized and may contain additional members as 
  compared to the super class. The greatest advantage of inheritance is that it 
  promotes generic design and code reuse. <BR><IMG

  <LI><B>What is multiple inheritance ? What are it's advantages and 
  disadvantages ? </B></A>
  <P>
  <P>Multiple Inheritance is the process whereby a sub-class can be derived from 
  more than one super class. The advantage of multiple inheritance is that it 
  allows a class to inherit the functionality of more than one base class thus 
  allowing for modeling of complex relationships. The disadvantage of multiple 
  inheritance is that it can lead to a lot of confusion when two base classes 
  implement a method with the same name. <BR><IMG

  <LI><B>What is polymorphism? </B></A>
  <P>
  <P>Polymorphism refers to the ability to have more than one method with the 
  same signature in an inheritance hierarchy. The correct method is invoked at 
  run-time based on the context (object) on which the method is invoked. 
  Polymorphism allows for a generic use of method names while providing 
  specialized implementations for them. <BR><IMG

  <LI><B>What do the keyword static and const signify ? </B></A>
  <P>
  <P>When a class member is declared to be of a static type, it means that the 
  member is not an instance variable but a class variable. Such a member is 
  accessed using Classname.Membername (as opposed to Object.Membername). Const 
  is a keyword used in C++ to specify that an object's value cannot be changed.

  <LI><B>How is memory allocated/deallocated in C ? How about C++ ? </B></A>
  <P>
  <P>Memory is allocated in C using malloc() and freed using free(). In C++ the 
  new() operator is used to allocate memory to an object and the delete() 
  operator is used to free the memory taken up by an object. <BR><IMG

  <P>A shallow copy simply creates a new object and inserts in it references to

  then creates in it copies of each of the members of the original object.

  <P>
  <P>One that can be modified by the class even when the object of the class or

  <P>Understanding this requirement implies an understanding of C++ const, which 
  many programmers do not have. I have seen large class designs that do not

  C++ efforts. One author suggests that some programmers find const to be such a 
  bother that it is easier to ignore const than to try to use it meaningfully. 
  No wonder many programmers don't understand the power and implications of 
  const. Someone who claims to have enough interest in the language and its

  const, however. <BR><IMG src="Sample Interview Questions_files/bann01.gif">
