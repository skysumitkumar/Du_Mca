there are twoo test ecch of 1.30h and having 50 questions each first questions logical ability in the first test and in the second test there are 50 questions from c , c++ data structure
 i am remembring few of them...
from tech..
1) what is class
2) what is encapsulation ---ans data hiding
3) which operator cann't be overloaded
 a)>>
 b)<<
 c)both of them
 d)none of them
4) what is the o/p of the following program
   float value(int t)
   {
   float i;
   i=216.16+(0.555555*t);
   return(t);
   }
  where t=464
 ans 1)516.26
	 2)none of them ---two options are more
5)class a can access the data of class  b if
  a)a is friend of b
  b)b is friend of a
  c)both a and b
  d)none of them
6)what is the o/p of this program
 value(int i)
 {
  i*=i;
}
value1(int *t)
{
*t*=*t;
}
void main()
{
int i=16,j=19;
value(i);
value(&j);
cout<<i<<' '<<j;
}
 7) study bit wise operator care fully ther were three questions from there
8)which assignment is used for copy contructor....logical assignment

ques were from blood relations, from syllogism and
case questions like
a diagram was given and ques were based on that
diagram...
numerical ability included some ques from
trignometrey,pippes&cisterns,time&work,ratio&proprtion..
there were not many of numerical ability....
section2 had most ques on c and ds around 30 and rest
were c++,most ques have more than 2 choices...
some of the ques were----
1.do friend funcs increase efficiency of c++ prgs.

  {
    int i,j;
    i=5;j=7;
