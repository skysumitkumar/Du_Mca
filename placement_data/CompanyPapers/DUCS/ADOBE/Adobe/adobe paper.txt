ADOBE PAPER ON 16th JULY 2006 
Hi 
I am Guru Pradeep M attended Adobe test on 16-07-2006. The test was on Analytical(easy), Quantitative(Easy), C(Easy but most on Data Structures).I Attended The test in Development Domain.Merit-Trac Conducted the test. Actually it was for both Testing & Devp Posn. Testing I dont Know.These are the quesns that was asked on C.Hope this Will help u a Lot. Waiting for results.Thank U.Bye Bye

ADOBE Written Test 
1) Wap to reverse a linked list and sort the same. 
2) Given two integers A & B. Determine how many bits required to convert
A to B. Write a function int BitSwapReqd(int A, int B);
3) Write an algorithm to insert a node into sorted linked list.After inserting,
the list must be sorted.
4) Without using /,% and * operators. write a function to divide a number by 3.
itoa() function is available.
5) Wap to swap two integer pointers.
6)Write a funcn int round(float x) to round off a floating point num to int.
7) write an ALP to find sum of First n natural numbers using the following Instructions

LDA num ; load Accumulator with num
DCR R ; decrement Register R
INR R ; increment Register R 
MOV x,y ; move the contents of register y into register x
JZ label ; jump to label if A=0
DJNZ label; Decrement & Jump if A <> 0
you can use B & C registers in addition to A register 
8) prove that a tree is BST.what is height of a tree?
9) Given A,B & C Boolean polynomials.Prove That (A+BC)=(A+B)(A+C)


Written Questions
Section I : Quantitive : 30 Qns 30 Min
Level was moderate. Many students could make even all 30 
Section II : Analytical Ability : 15 Qns 15 Min
Level was moderate. 
Section III : Engineering : 1 Hr

was moderate. Have a feel with the following Qns:
1. void foo1()
{
if(A<B) 
Then {_/*.... */}
else
if(C<D)
then foo2() 
}
How many time foo2() would get called given
A<B 25% of the times and C<D 75% of the times and 
foo1() is called 5000 times
2. A parallel program if executed on a single processor takes N secs. 40 % of the 
the program is of sequntial nature. What is the least amount of time that the 
program takes if executed on 
a> 2 processors
b> 4 processors
3. Given a complete N ary tree. The no. of non leaf nodes is M. Then find
out the total number of leaf nodes
4. write an algo to calculate x^n in O(lg n) time
5. 
void foo(int n)
{
int h=n;
while(h>0)
{
for( int i=1;i<=n;i++);
h=h/2;
}
}
What is the timing complexity of the function 
6. Give a finite automata which does not accept any string containing aabb
Alphbet set is {a,b}
7. There was a 32 bit Hexadecimal digit. You have to find out number of 1s
8. 
Void foo()
{
int counter=0
for(int i=0;i<10;i++)
{
counter++;
for(int i=0;i<10;i++)
counter++;
}
What will be the final value of counter ?
9. Given the Preorder and Inorder of a tree, we had to construct the tree 
10. and some more 

Section IV : C : 40 Mins
Was easy
1. what is the diff between 
char *a="hello";
and char a[]="hello";
Explain

2. How to invert 20th bit
3. Write programs :
a> to find the max of three nums in one statement using ternary op.
b> to implement atoi()
c> to find the rightmost occurence of given pattern in a given string
d> to print 1,1,2,3,5,.... 20 terms. Write recursive fun.
e> to invert all odd bits of an int 
4. and other easy questions 
Interview:
2 tech each of around 1 hr and onr HR
Important Questions of Interview :
1. Find all the anagrams of a given word in the least amount of time. You are
provided a dictionary which u can preprocess in any way
2. You are receiving a continuous bit stream, one bit at a time. You have
to tell when the number formed by the current and previous bit stream is
divisible by 5. You are not allowed to store the info regarding the bits which 
have already passed
3. There is a sorted array. Some numbers from the start have been rotated left.
[ just like left rotate with carry ]. Now give the algo of bin search to find
an element in O(lg n) time
4. You are given an array of sive n of positive and negative numbers. Also given
another number k. U have to find whether the sum of any two of the numbers 
from the array is equal to k in O(n) time.
5. Some puzzles
6. Some C questions
7. And many more but moderately difficult questions from Algos and OS 
In HR : Some puzzles and some regular stuffs 
Hope to see you there next Year. 
Bye
