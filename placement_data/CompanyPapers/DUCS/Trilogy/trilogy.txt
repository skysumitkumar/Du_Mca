interview :1 telephonic

q1.  array of n sorted integers of size n  
     array of m sorted integers of size m+n(array size)

 merge them in second array 

problem i faced: give as many approaches as possible i gave 4 but that was not max

q2. Two node pointers are given find their common ancesstor
 
    question divided in four parts : 1. node pointers of binary tree
 2.node pointers of tree(not binary tree)

now same two conditions but now tree is built by parent pointers not by left or right child pointers
  
     problem i faced :code all of them in any language c,c++,java etc.

interview :2 telephonic
q1. find largest n second largest of an arrray of size n in n+log n - 2 operations then write the code in language
q2. find max n min in of an arrray of size n n+log n - 2 operations then write the code in language

interview :3 telephonic
q1. calculate no of on bits in n bit integer in O(n)time
q2. then u hav to calculate no of on bits in m million no in O(m) time mis very large than n;
code them
one more ques i dont remember


interview : 4 face to face
for a binary tree
write 
q1.        inorder traversal recursive
q2.        remove tail recursion 
q3.        remove total recursion (iterative)traverse using stacks
q4.        convert it into threaded tree(dont write different code convert it)
q5.        now do inorder travesal without using stacks use ur threaded tree.




ANSWERS to all these ques that too optimal ones i know but difficult to write ask me if u want

BYE best of luck
