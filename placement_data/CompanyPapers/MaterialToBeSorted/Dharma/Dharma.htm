<p>The format of the dharma paper is like this:</p>

<p>There will be two sets of papers, one the technical which is full of c and the other is
aptitude which has very simple questions (about 60 of them) but what matters is the speed
at which one does the paper. The aptitude paper is fairly simple and is pretty
straightforward so we aren't putting it up here. We would suggest that you view the
aptitude papers of other companies put on this site to get an idea about it. The technical
paper is slightly different as it covers C in depth. This is the paper that we have kept
as the sample test given below.</p>

<p>The information on the interview is pretty sketchy but it consists mainly of technical
grilling. We would suggest that you take a look at the <a href="../Intsec.htm">Interview
section.</a> to get a better idea and view some useful tips for taking interviews.</p>
