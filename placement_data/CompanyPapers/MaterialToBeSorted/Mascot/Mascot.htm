<p><br>
There are a total <strong>6 sections </strong>in the test. Each section has <strong>10
questions </strong>and the total time given is <strong>60 minutes</strong>.<br>
All questions are <strong>MCQ type</strong>. The following are the sections: 

<ul>
  <li><strong>Computer Fundamentals</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Algorithms</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Hardware</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Software</strong></li>
  <li><strong>General Awareness </strong></li>
  <li><strong>Languages</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>There is also an <strong>aptitude test</strong> which is held along with the technical
test. Refer <strong>R.S. Aggarwal</strong> for more sample questions.<br>
The pattern of this test is known to vary with respect to the number of sections and time.
Another variant of this test has two sections -- a <strong>technical </strong>(with <strong>40
questions, 40 marks </strong>in <strong>40 minutes</strong>) and an <strong>aptitude </strong>section
(with <strong>30 questions, 30 marks </strong>in <strong>30 minutes</strong>) -- with <strong>negative
marking (1:4)</strong>. We have included one test on this pattern also. We recommend that
you go through both the tests to get the feel of the kind of paper that you could expect.</p>
