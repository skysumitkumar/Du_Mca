C and aptti common for both EC and comp sc.

c test---
i dont remember all of the questions ....m compiling afer long time...

1.
for(i=1;i<=100;i++)
 for(j=1;j<=100;i++)
    a[i][j]=100;

for(j=1;j<=100;i++)
 for(i=1;i<=100;i++)
    a[i][j]=100;
which one is faster

2.
char *p="hello";
printf(p);
whats the o/p?

3.
char buffer[]="asfdfdf";//7 letters..
which is false?
a.buffer can store more than 8
b.individual element can be changed...
c.

4.one on switch case...
ans was 2

5.one question on size of pointer..(2 bytes)

6.one question on pass by value...
the value dont change after the return..
function is called withsomething like
fun(i++,--k,--j)

7.one question is on pointer...and we are asked whether we access the same elemement 
or not....
something like
(ptr++)->str;(++ptr)->str..etc..


technical-----

1.which is least expensive for a 4096 bit memeory
a.1024x4
b.512x8
c.4096x1
d.

2.advtg of SRAM over DRAM
1.less expensive...
2.less power consuming
3.fast
4.none

3.which is false
1.delay of synch counter depends on total no of f/fs
2.delay of synch counter depends on only one f/f
3.delay of ripple counter depends on total no of f/fs
4 something similar

4. a 4 bit synch counter delay of 1 f/f 15ns
whats the total delay
1.15ns
2.60ns
etc.

5.Go back N algorithm works for what kind of n/ws
1.huge propogation delays....and high speed requirements..(correct)
etc..

6.packet length L channel capacity C max propn delay
1.L/C
2.1/C
3.C/L
4.1/(CL)**10.5   :)

7.satellite channel ...total delay given..length of packet given...
u rexpected to find out no of packets that can be transmitted...

8.one on fourier transform..
whats the fourier transform of x(n-k) ?

9.source coding vs channel coding ..
options were on the properties of both
which is true..

best of luck...
