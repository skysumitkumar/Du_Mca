</ul>

<p>The written test consists of <strong>aptitude </strong>and <strong>technical&nbsp;</strong>questions.
The current pattern contains <strong>20 questions </strong>to be done in <strong>50
minutes </strong>and there is <strong>negative marking</strong>. Earlier the pattern was
of&nbsp; 4 to 5 sections with questions of <strong>MCQ </strong>type. The sections were
divided into <strong>analytical ,verbal , assertion and reasoning </strong>and <strong>data
sufficiency</strong>. The former pattern is more commonly used in the tests.</p>

<p></font>The interview is preceded by a <strong>group discussion </strong>where the
topics given are very general in kind.In the interview more stress is placed on HR, though
technical questions (primarily on <strong>C/C++</strong>) and puzzles too are to be
expected. We would suggest that you take a look at the <a href="../Intsec.htm">Interview
