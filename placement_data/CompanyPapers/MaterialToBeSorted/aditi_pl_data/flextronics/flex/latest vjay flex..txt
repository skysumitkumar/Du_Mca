 Written Test
At the moment we have just one paper of Hughes Software. The paper is technical based with a
question or two of probabilty thrown in. Subjects stressed are Operating Systems,
 Data Structures, C Programming, Communications etc. We have given a rough idea 
on the kind of paper that you can expect. We are not providing you with the inputs
 of the interview for this company - but we hope to add it very shortly.

Regarding Hughes
paper they conducted two tests. Both were technical(no aptitude test). 
First one was compulsory for everybody. In second one could opt for
electronics or computers. In all i suppose there were 50 questions.
I sent a request to my classmates to send me questions whatevery they
could recall. Till now only one person has responded. I am sending those
questions to you.

And just before interview you were supposed to fill up a performa which
they call Behavioural Test. This was to check you interpersonal skills and
socialising capabilities. Questions like - would you like to be elected
leaders of organising committees, do you like peoply express their agonies
to you, do you wish people be close to you type questions were repeated in
one and the other form.

Interview was technical as well as personal. CGPA did count - it seems.
They selected 8 people from here. BTW what's your current CGPA and what's
the strength of your class. Do they come for B.Tech and M.Tech separatel
as the case here is or it's all at once.

Questions :

1.If a precondition of a sub routine fails then
a. post condition fails as well
b. Post condition may fail
c. post condition is declared but now defined.

2. whatz the o/p of the following program

char * a= "AabbCc";
void x(char *a)
{ 
a[0] == 0 ? x(a+1):1;
printf("%c",*a);
return 1; 
}
x(a);

a. AaBbCc
b. cCbBaA

3. What is DHCP used for?

4. There are 2protocols IP and IPX are running on top of Ethernet. Suppose
a packet addressed to that ethernt card arrives, to which protocol the
ethernet sends the packet?
1. It checks the payload of the frame and finds out the protocol type and
despatches it to the right protocol
2. It fins out the protocol type that is mentioned in the ethernet frame.
3. despatches to both the protocol

5. What is the use of global static variable in C?

6. In which stage of the compilation the Macro in C are converted into
Iline code? (this is not the exact Qn a slight variation of it)
