Why DMA controller is used?
What are the different I/O
techniques used in microprocessors?
They asked me to design an 8 bit
SISO (s=serial) register and a SIPO (p=parallel)register?

recursion? Write a program to recursively add the first 5 natural
nos

Why is the OSI reference model divided into layers?
Explain
logical address(MAC), IP address , and port address, where are they
used?
Difference between connection-oriented and connection less
