CTS Paper of 8th November 
TIME= 60 mins
QUES=
 40
VENUE= Kolkata
COLOR = Purple
===================================================
(1) What is the co-efficient of the term independent of x in the series 
[ (1/2)(1/x)^1/3 +(1/x)^(-1/5)]^8. where ^ denotes "to the power of". 
(2) In an examination a student must answer 65% of the questions
 
correctly. But it was found that after answer 7 questions corretly out of the 
first 14, the student qualified. What is the min no. of questions in 
the paper. (a) 22 (b) 18 (c) 20 (d) Can't say
(3) There r two jars. In the first jar there is 25%Milk and in the 
second jar there is 50% milk. What ratio of milk should be added to get 12 
lit of milk from the two jars such that we get 62.5% Milk in the whole 
mixture. [Ans: 6lit : 6lit]
(4) There r 8 envelops and 8 letters. What is the probability that the 
all the letters will be inserted in the correct envelop.
(5) There r two bridges at a distance of 1Km. A person starts rowing 
upstream from 1st bridge and when he reaches the second
 bridge he losses 
his cap. After 15mins he realises it and turns bach and rows downstream 
and catches his hat at the bottom of 1st bridge. Find : The speed of 
boat in still water
(6) Same problem but find the speed of  the river
(7) There are 1000 doors that are of the open-close type. When a person 
opens the door he closes it and then opens the other. When the first 
person goes he opens-closes the doors ion the multiples of 1 i.e., he 
opens and closes all the doors. when the second goes he opens and closes 
the doors 2, 4 6 8 respectively. Similarly when the third one goes he 
does this for 3 6 9 1 2 15th doors resly. Find number of doors that are 
open at last. [Ans: 31]
(8) 40 people can do a work in 60 days. After every 10 days 5 persons 
keeps leaving the job. In how many days will the job be completed.
(9) A square field is there of dim : 40 X 60 m. A 1 m path is 
surrounded on the field outside it. What is the area of the path.
(10) x=2 + 2^(1/3) + 2^(2/3). Find the value of x^3 -6x^2 - 8x. 
Something like this we have to find the answer was 8.
(11) There was a puzzle on 5 traders in the name 
Steel,wood,Timber....and they produce Steel, wood, timber ...and supply them to others but 
not to the manufacturer of it. For eg: Steel supplies Wood's Product to 
the reciver of Timber. 
this was a comfusing puzzle. About 4 questions
 were from this part
(12) A person starts from A to B. After 1hr his tyre gets punctured and 
he repairs it for 10 mins and travels the rest of the distant with 
30km/hr and arrives 30 min late. had the puncture occured 30 Kms earlier he 
wud been only 15 mins late. Find the ditance betn. A & B and his intila 
speed.
Beside these there were about 20 question on English like Fill in the 
blanks, passage with conclusion, passage with some questions, Questions 
on whether cond. A is sufficient to solve the problem, whether cond. B 
is sufficient to solve the problem, whether cond. A & B both r 
neccessary  to solve the problem. Whether the problem cannot be solved with the 
two conditions given. I was surprised to see s many English portions in 
the paper very much unlike CTS.
