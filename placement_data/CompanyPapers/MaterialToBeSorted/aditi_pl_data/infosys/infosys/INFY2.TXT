Grass in lawn grows equally thick and in a uniform rate.
 It takes 24 days for 70 cows and 60 for 30 cows . 
How many cows can eat away the same in 96 days.? 











Ans : 20 
g - grass at the beginning 
r - rate at which grass grows, per day 
y - rate at which cow eats grass, per day 
n - no of cows, to be found 
g + 24*r = 70 * 24 * y 
g + 60*r = 30 * 60 * y 
g + 96*r = n * 96 * y 
Solving, n = 20. 
11)
