Subject: [CHETANA] (Paper Pattern) Satyam


Hi Yaar,
Lot of people were asking me abt online test.
I didn't have any such test.I'll try to find out if they've changed the pattern and inform you guys.
I'm from JNTU Kakinada.We had a Campus test conducted by Satyam for about 5-6 colleges at Hyderabad on 31 May.
There were 4 phases in toto:
Written test(flow charts etc>> very easy..almost every one got thru)
The written test mostly comprised of simple flow charts.There were 30 q's and 30 mins. There were about 10 q's from arithmetic..One question was 
there is enough food stocks for 30 people to last for 30 days..5 people left after 5 days and 10 joined after 5 more days.For How many days will the stocks last?
GD
Technical Interview
Personal Interview
Later parts of elimination were tough.People were eliminated even in the fourth phase.Hope this info would be helpful.
Bye
Vijay
