Subject: [CHETANA] (Pattern) Satyam test held in Hyderabad


hi everyone
This is Nishant and I am trying to just recollect some of the written test questions and interview questions of Satyam(20th Sep'03 Hyderabad).
It was a 30 min test with 15questions to be done and all questions were reasoning and analytical type.Nothing tech or General awareness sort of questions except for 1 algo question.Purely reasoning and analytical.There was 1/4 negative marking.for correct answer 1 mark was given.So plz don't make wild guesses bcos even half mark may disqualify u.There were 750 students who attended the test.284 were selected for GD and then 170 for interview and finally 54 were given offers.
i don't remember exactly questions but i will give whatever i remember.
1              there was a series given
57    58    118    357    1432   ?
207  A      B         C         D     E
the question was to first find what will come inplace of '?' then similarly complete the lower series and give answer for E.
2     One question was 5-2+3*1+4 .the question was to find the order of precedence of operators.
Ans + is preferred over -,and - is preferred over *.
3. There was one algo.It was a lenghty one.I cud not even attempt to read it.
4 One question was on set theory.like 100 people drink tea,milk,coffee.25 drink tea only.15 drink coffee only,35 drink milk only.10 drink coffee and tea.5 drink coffee and milk and 10 drink tea and milk.5 drink all three.then we have to find no of people who drink nothing.(numbers are not correct.I have just written arbitrarily to explain the type of question.language was same just figures are not correct)
5-7        3 questions were based on a diagram(i am just telling u type)
like rectangle was drawn and it was said that rectangle represent cultivated area
square represent educated people
circle represents areas with mail facility
triangle represents areas with power supply.
in these overlapping figures at various places numbers were written
then questions like how many educated people live in cultivated area but not having power supply.
Number 4 represents??
whats the total number of people who are educated and have power supply?
like this 3 ques were there and it was the simplest one i shud say.u can try out such questions from R.S.Agarwal chapter name is Logical Venn Diagrams and in the chapter the questions are given at the end under the heading Type2. 
8 there was a figure based question.3 were given and we have to find the next one.
9 there was one one lenghty question with number of statements given(abt 9 or 10) then it was asked who is the owner of fish.
10.  Another reasoning question was there like there are 3 persons Jack, Smith,Robinson  and their occupation are engineer,accountant and engine driver not respectively.now they are travelling in a train and there are 3 ladies on the same train with names Ms Jack,Ms Robinson and Ms Smith.following this 5-6 statements were given and we were asked who is the engineer???
a. Mr smith  b  Mr Jack        c  Mr Robinson    d  none of these  e  data insufficient.
11  There was one coding question like scotland is coded as 12345678. LOTS is coded as(can't rem).one more coding was given and then asked whats the code for C.
(a) 6  (b)  0   (c) 4  (d) 5  (e)  9
Ans (a)
12-13 two more series questions were there where we had to tell the missing thing.
Ans one answer is FACE.
I just   remember this much abt written test.if i will recollect any thing else then i will mail abt it on the group.
For GD topic 
A group of 10 was made and we were given a topic "Environment- Whose Responsibility".Try to initiate and plz dont start fighting to speak.They are just looking what u speak and not how much u speak.Speak relevant to topic and don't try to deviate from it.And in the end try to give a conclusion bcos more ppl are taken from those grp which finally presented some conclusion.
Regarding Interview for me a panel of 3 members was there and asked me HR as well as tech q at the same time.Panel was really very gud and make u feel very comfortable.Don't try to bluff if u don't know something simply say sorry Sir/Madam I don't have any idea abt this.Rem to go thru the company website and look for same specific details like what are the major areas in which company has an expertise.Bcos 1 question is always there with every company that what do u know abt us?
well I being Electronics Engineer 1st Ques was why did u choose electronics for ur specialisation.then they asked now why do u want to be a software engineer trainee?? Why don't u join ur core companies.
Then why Satyam??? What do u know abt us.What prep have u done for Satyam Walkin(i.e for Written,GD and interview).
Then asked abt my hobbies.I told them reading and travelling.they asked what type of books or magazines do i read?? Do i also read some journals related to my field if specialization??I said I do but i am nt regular abt journals?? He asked why so I told him that Its bcos I being from a small city its not possible to get those costly journals there.He looked satisfied and asked me how will ur hobby of travelling can help Satyam.Then he asked me to tell him abt some of my strong and weak points.
Another member asked me abt my flexibilty for shifts and relocation and when can I join Satyam if I am finally given offer.
Regarding technical I was asked abt difference between 8085 and 8086.Then some keys that is what is their purpose (related to microprocessors).Some q on interrupts.Then he asked me few q on C/C++.he asked what is the purpose of preprocessor.What is obj file.gave me a small code and asked the output.Asked me abt constructors.Then since in my biodata I had mentioned abt my desire to work in database he asked what is a database.What is relational database??Here I answered few q but since I have just started learning Oracle I told him frankly Sir I don't have much knowledge,I just started it a month back.Well he just asked me few more q.Fortunately I was able to tell all of them.Then he asked suppose u r given a project on a technology u don't prefer then how will u manage it?what will be ur reaction.
Then he asked me abt my vocational training projects.What was my actual work there and what tech I used there.U need to be clear abt the project u have mentioned bcos they will def be asking u few q abt ur project.U can tell them any out of vocational or college projects.But be confident.
That's all I rem abt interview.I hope it will help u atleast a bit for ur prep.
The main thing they were looking up for was the right attitude.So Don't get panic.Remain cool and confident.
And Yes if anybody get a call for interview in Satyam and he has a french beard then remove it or they will remove ur chances of getting in.
OK so best of luck to all of u guys.
Nishant.
