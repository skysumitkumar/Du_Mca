Subject: [CHETANA] I aced SATYAM selection!!!-Test,GD & intv pattern given.


Friends!

I have got placed at Satyam Computer Services..I
attended the process at Chennai..Out of nearly 420, 28
were selected..My sincere thanks and wishes to this
group!

Questions:

1) For this question take 
A-1,B-2,C-3..........X-24,Y-25,Z-26.

Edwin is a judge and a numerologist.He is married to
a woman whose name:

a) has a "product" that is the same as that for
JUDGE:using the correspondence of letters and numbers
above, this product is 10*21*4*7*5.
b)has no letter in common with JUDGE.
c)Has no third letter of the alphabet because 3 is his
unlucky number.
d)Has letters in alphabetical order when the first
letter and second letter are interchanged.

What is the name of the judge's wife?

2) The owner of the house has been murdered. The
visitors to the mansion were Allen,bixby and Crain.

a) The murderer ,who was one of the three visitors
,arrived at the mansion later than atleast one of the
other two visitors.
b)A detective,who was one of the three
visitors,arrived at the mansion earlier than atleast
one of the other two visitors   
c)The detective arrived at the mansion at midnight.
d)Neither Allen nor Bixby arrive at the mansion after
midnight
e)the earlier arriver of Bixby and crain wasnot the
detective
f)the later arriver of allen and crain was not the
murderer

Who was the murderer?

3) some farm tools and farm equipments have been
stolen..3 farm workers were interrogated..Each one
makes 2 statements.(i dont remember the statements)One
of the statements made by each of them is right while
the other is wrong. We have to tell who stole them.

4) There is 4-digit number..the second digit is 2 more
than the first..the last digit is five more than the
third..something like this..it is very simple..jus
have to go from the choices given..

5) 

           A       D
           B   G   E
           C       F


Each of seven digits from 0,1,2,3...8,9 is :
a) represented by a different letter in the figure
above.
b) positioned in the figure above so that A*B*C, B*G*E
and D*E*F are equal.

Which digit does G represent?

6) Given the names of four persons..and also given
that one is taller than the other but shorter than
someone else..statements like these..we have to find
who is the shortest..

7) A man is walking inside the tunnel AB. when he is
3/8th of the distance from A, he hears a train coming
from behind him..he sees that when he moves towards B,
the train just catches him at B, and similar logic if
he tried to reach A..the man walks at a steady rate of
8m/h..what is the speed of the train?

8)Fifty minutes ago if it was four times as many
minutes past four o clock, how many minutes is it to
six o clock?

9) a simple problem related to ages..

10) There are 5 dacoits who have together stolen some
gold coins..they stay at a place for the night hiding
the bounty safely...When evreyone's asleep, one of the
dacoits wakes up, takes 1/5th of the bounty plus one
for himself..the rest he puts back in the bag and goes
to sleep..the next dacoit wakes up, does the same
thing,ie takes 1/5th of the remaining bounty plus one
for himself, puts the rest back and goes to sleep..the
third,fourth and fifth dacoits do the same thing..in
the morning, they all wake up and divide the bounty
equally among them..how may coins were there
originally? The key to this question is to proceed
from the options..see which number leaves a remainder
1 when divided by 5 four times continuously and the
fifth time divides it exactly.

The rest 5 quests i dont remember....Quests 1,2 and 5
have been lifted straight out of Puzzles' by George
Summers..8 is from Shakuntala Devi..

Dont attempt the questions u r not confident of..


The GD round is said to be the Main elimination round
in Satyam..The topic we were given was "US war on
Iraq"..Some other topics could be "environmental
pollution", "Indian Hockey" etc.

The interview consisted of both technical and HR
questions..Expect questions from ur project..and brush
up the subjects in ur major..

CSE- majors were asked on DBMS, a bit of networking,
Object Orientation concepts.etc..

All the Bext Friends!!!

Kannan
