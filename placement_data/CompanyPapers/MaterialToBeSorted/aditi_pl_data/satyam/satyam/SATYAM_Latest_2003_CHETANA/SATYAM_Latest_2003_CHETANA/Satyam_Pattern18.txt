Subject: [CHETANA] Hi I got selected in SATYAM,Gd topic given.


Hi! Everyone

I got selected in Satyam after much struggle.I would like to thank the owners of this wonderful group and all the members who have been providing valuable information about companies from time to time.

Well coming to the point I would like to tell u abt the pattern.Actually its a 30 min test and there are 15 questions. The most important thing is time management.questions are very easy.I will soon be mailing the questions on the group id.My topic for GD was "Environment-Whose Responisibility".

Questions for interview were mainly from C,C++.And he also asked me my choice so I told him data base so he also me few questions on data base.With the paper I will also mail the int questions.

Bye for now and once again Thanks to all of u.

Nishant.
