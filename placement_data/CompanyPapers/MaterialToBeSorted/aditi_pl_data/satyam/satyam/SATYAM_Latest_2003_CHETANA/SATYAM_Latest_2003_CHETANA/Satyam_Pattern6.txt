Subject: [CHETANA] (Pattern)satyam paper pattern


Dear all,

I don't have the satyam paper. but i came to know the pattern from one of my friend who wrote the exam in Hyderabad some 15 days back.

the paper consists of 15 bits
the time period is 30 mins.

questions consisits of arthematic(aptitude), reasoning and three questions on English 

paper is damn easy and most of them will be qualified.

then comes the 2nd round Group discussion.

In this my friend new only 3 topics. 
1. effect of cinema on Youth
2. Education in India compared to Foreign nations
3.............................................. 
(sorry I don't remember it eventhough my friend told me)

I know up to this.
because my friend didn't qualified for the further round.

probably the next rounds will be technical and HR I think.

that's all I know folks,

regards,
Bharath Kumar
