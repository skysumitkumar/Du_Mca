Subject: [CHETANA] (Pattern) Satyam


friends,
        
 
       satyam has changed their pattern , only 15 questions asked and 30 min duration.mostly in the form of logical reasoning.try to prepare from GMAT / CAT books ,it will be useful. yesterday in chennai i attended 
the test.
out of 2050 , 1400 appeared for the written test. and 448 filtered for GD. then from that 152 called for interview .

from 152 they may be selecting 75 or 50.

i was eliminated in the GD .

if anyone having satyam test ahead , concentrate on logical reasoning and GD but u may get 1 or 2 questions from Venn diagrams and non verbal reasoning also
 
 GD topics i had 
 
1.can america occupy iraq
2.cricket shud be banned or not..
 
all the best
 
regds 
ram
