Subject: [CHETANA] I got thru SATYAM

Hi all. I attended the selection process in Delhi on 28,29 sep. Out of 448 who sat for the aptitude test,223 got thru for GD.then 107 got selected for interview. out of this, a whopping 73 were finally selected!!

Apti had logical puzzles like infosys pattern,slightly simpler - 15 ques in 30 min with negative marking. I marked only 8,and i think got all right. then in GD topic was : Should GD be important  in selection process. Guys started with saying that GD is very imp, this that blah blah. But i said that main thing is what kind of skills the company is looking for in the candidate.like for a Software Engr job technical knowledge is most imp. 

then interview was ok lasted for 30 min,mainly technical - databases,why database should be used instead of files. i forgot one main point which the interviewer mentioned - that security is an advantage with databases over traditional file structures. then pointers,diff b/w call by value & reference, OS - diff b/w multitasking,multithreading,multiprocessing. what is thrashing ?( i didnt know).

Regards

Rohit Sapru.
