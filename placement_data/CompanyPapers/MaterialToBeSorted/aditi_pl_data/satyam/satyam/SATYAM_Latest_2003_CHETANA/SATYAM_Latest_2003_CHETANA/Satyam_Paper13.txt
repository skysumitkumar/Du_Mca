14. 

15.

Sorry I donot remember all the Questions. I tried my
best to recall all.

My advice to future test takers is that for clearing
this Satyam test one should avoid making guesses, shud
do all familiar and easy questions first. Avoid making
any wild guesses, infact i (now) think that one should
not guess at all when there is negative marking. 

I feel extremely sad that i could not clear this test
even after a lot of preperation (of Quant mainly thru
R.S. Aggarwal, puzzles) and hard work. My fault lay in
choosing the wrong questions, getting stuck for 7mins
on first Question, Guessing(so called educated
guesses) upto four answers I did 10 qs in all, 5 or 6
were surely right, rest i have no idea. But I will
never give up. I will keep trying. . . Whoknows MAYBE
one day i will get my first job in a decent software
organisation.

Thank You all once again, for everything.

Bye
All The Best to u and Me

The Fight Continues...
Anup
