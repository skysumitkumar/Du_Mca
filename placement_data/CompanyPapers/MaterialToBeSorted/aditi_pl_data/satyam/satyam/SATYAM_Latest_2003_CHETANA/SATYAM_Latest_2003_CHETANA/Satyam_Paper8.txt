Subject: [CHETANA] (Job) I got placed in satyam + Paper is given


Hurray I got into SATYAM.
Peers I am harsha here ,a 2003 batch- telecom  fresher
. I attended the SATYAM test on November 1st .the
venue of the test was PESIT College , Bangalore.

At last I could make it . I would like to thank
CHETANA madam , the group and also SURENDRA. If
chetana madam had not started this group, we could not
have got the information about the recruitment  in
other Companies.  She has been the person behind every
one's success in this group. 

Then I will thank you guys. Many people gave the info
about the recruitment. Many gave previous papers. Many
more gave the test papers after they wrote the test. 

Last but not least , SURENDRA reddy sir. He was always
a source of inspiration to me. Whenever I feel
depressed about not getting a job , I would read the
sayings which he would send . that helped me a lot
even when a bad time was going.

CHETANA madam give me oppertunities , you peers gave
me information and Surendra sir - he is my guru  who
gave me additional strength.

Peers don't think I got a lot of opportunities to
write the test . I have written only 5 tests in last 4
months. I roamed , went to almost every company ,
dropped hardcopy of my resume . I applied  to whatever
id I got from the group.  Even then only 5 companies
thought I was eligible for (atleast) test.

INFOSYS written test failed
ORACLE written test failed
HUGHES written test failed
SASKEN  written test failed
SATYAM passed the written test , GD & tech and HR
interview 

Don't get disheartened if you have not got jobs yet .
I heard that NOV-2-MARCH  is the peak recruitment time
for all companies. I wrote INFOSYS test when I was in
8th sem. I wrote ORACLE & SASEN 18th OCTOBER . I wrote
HUGHES on 21st OCTOBER . last SATYAM on NOVENMBER 1st
.

i would wish you all "best of luck" and i will hope
that each one of us would be placed within
DECEMBER-2003

THANK YOU ,   THANK YOU VERY MUCH .
