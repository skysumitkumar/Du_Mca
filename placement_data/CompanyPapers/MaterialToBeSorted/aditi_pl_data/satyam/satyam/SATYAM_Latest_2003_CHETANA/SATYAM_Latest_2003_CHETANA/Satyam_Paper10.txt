Subject: [CHETANA] (Paper) SATYAM written & Interview questions held on SEP 20&21st


hi frenz,
 
        This is my first mail to the group.Recently i have attended SATYAM selection procedure on 20 & 21st of sep.
 I have cleared written test and GD but failed in interview. To my consious i did the interview very well
 but what they think is all that matters.
Around 800 appeared . 240 thru to GD. 117 thru to INTERVIEW, n around 50 selected finally.
 I am giving you the models of questions in written test.
Total 15 questions(1 mark each) r given 30 mins with 1/4 -ve marking. All r objective.
> If SCOTLAND = 12345678,  SAT=453, DON=128, and SALT=3782  then  C = ?
       SAT,DON,SALT are not the exact words that were given but similar .
   LOGIC : C is not ther in any of the words other than 'scotland' and also 6. so  C = 6.
> 3 persons travelling in a train.Mr.SMITH,Mr.JONES n Mr.ROBINSON they r ENGINEER, FIREMAN n 
BRAKESMAN, but not respectively. Also travelling r 3 ladies with same names Mrs.SMITH, Mrs.JONES
n Mrs.ROBINSON.
 1. Mr.ROBINSON lives in DETROIT.
 2. BREAKSMAN lives in midway of CHICAGO n DETROIT.
 3. Mr.SMITH beats fireman in a game of billiards.
 4. Mr. JONES earns $20000 per annum.
 5. BREAKSMAN's nearest neighbour earns exactly 3 times that of BREAKSMAN.
 Like this conditions r given and question asked is who is the ENGINEER?
 I don't remember the exact conditions. 
Question is just tricky but not so tough to analyze.
> A question on number series. Using the relation of the first series find out E?
      57 58 118 357 1432
     205         A                  B C D  E
    
> A large question almost a page. Very simple to answer. Some 20 facts r given n a question below
which is not relevant to facts. So answer is NONE.
 Just go thru the facts in  rapid fire n answer. Answer this question only at the last if time permits or else
u will be stuck with it.
> Inferance question.
  Children r frequently used in drug business.
  I. Children r smarter than grown ups.
 II. Children can be easily convinced n r not suspected.
 III. when they become young they can be easily trained.
 Like this 3 stmts r given and asked that which of the stmts r implicit. 
 
> A square , rectangle, circle n triangle r drawn in a overlapped manner n some number r given 
 in the intersection parts( like venn digrams).
 square - cultivated area
 rectangle - desert area
 circle - electricity present
 triangle - medical facilities
 how much area is cultivated  with electricity present but have no medical facilities.
 like this 3 questions r given, the easiest one.
>1. A = B+C
  2. D = A+F
  3. E = B+D
  4. G = C+E
  5. B = D+A
  6. C = G+F
like this 6 stmts r given(not exactly the same) n asked which of the stmts can be executed parallely.
> A C prog to shift an array towards left is given with some blanks in the place of while conditions.
Have to fill the blanks.
> A problem which can be solved easily using venn diagrams.
> A sequence of 4 diagrams is given n have to find out the next diagram in the sequence.

topics same as given previously.
>UNO's   portion in keeping peace (My topic)
>Is CHINA a software threat to INDIA

INTERVIEW:
Most of them had HR & PROJECT DESCRIPTION. but they didn't asked me a single question on my
project. I had interview for more than 30 mins. 
Both tech & HR interviews r combined, for me there is a panel of 3 (HR+TECH+other). the other person
is a lady who selected me in the GD.
HR questions:
Q : Tell about yourself?
 My Ans:  my name, my qualification then said i like  competitive environment thats y i have 
chosen Computer science field then my hobbies.
Q : My scores r X-85%, Inter-85% n in engg. - 70%. He asked y is this drop?
My ans : My class highest itself is 77%.
Q: y didn't u get that mark?
My ans: Internals made the difference because they carry about 20% of marks.
Q: y didn't u get more marks in internals?
My ans: I don't like to flatter my leacturers for just 1/2 or 1 mark. ( this may not be a reasonal answer)
Q: I took long term for EAMCET. y is this break after Inter?
My ans: i told i took longterm. I explained y i took. First i got 6227 rank for that i got MECH seat but 
i more interested  in Computerscience field, i took long term n got 509 rank. then also i got MECH seat 
in REC but i have chosen CS field.
Q: Eloborate the terms u have used  previously "COMPETITIVE environment"?
My ans: I want to enjoy my  success out of healthy competion but not winning in a competion of 2 
participants. That is y i dropped after Inter for getting my competitive field Computer science.
Q: y do u want join in SATYAM?
My ans: read some thing from  company website and told the same.
Q: What do u expect from company?
My ans: nice work, good environment and ofcourse the salary.

My ans: Environment then work and then salary.
Q: Do u mind working in Bhubaneswar if u r placed ther?
My ans: I don't mind abt the place i work wat i mind is only environment n work given.
Q: Strengths n Weaknesses.
My ans: hard working and grasping power are my strengths
                Unnecessary consciousness about my self and poor at byhearting things.
Technical Interview:
The questions will proceed according to your answers. No standard order.
Q: what r the prog. languages u had? I told Assembly,C,C++,JAVA,VB,VC++
Q: Which generation of language is Assembly? I told 2 gen, since firstly they used to enter i/p in binary 
then to simplify the work Assembly is introduced.
Q: Assembly program execution is faster or slow? I told faster.
Q: What r 4th gen languages? I told i don't know
Q: What is STACK?
Q: Any other thing like STACK?
Q: why to use pointers?
Q: Which data type u use for pointers? data type of value which we want to point to. I said even we can have 
VOID pointers.
Q: What is the use of void ?
Q: Why do u need functions which return nothing?
Q: How do compile a JAVA program? Using JAVAC we compile and we get 'bytecode', then it is presented
to JVM which interprets the code and converts it into machine code.
Q: what is interpretation?
Q: What is differernce between Compilation and interpretation?
Q: In RDBMS what is referential integrety? I told about foreign and primary constrains.
 he said it is no where relevant to my question. I was calm.
Thats what i remember from my tech interview. What i feel is u only ANSWER TO THE POINT ONLY. 
then he has to ask something else or else he will dig deep from ur answers.
Again the HR took and started:
Q: What sports do u play, wat r other extra curricular activities do u have?
Q: wat is ur family background?
Q: Any problems faced during ur project not technically? want to test ur ability to work in a team.
Q: What is the tough stage u faced till now during ur whole education?
thats wat i remember from my INTERVIEW.
It went nice and i also answered very confidently but ...
It was my first interview and after the interview was over i was very happy that i did so well to manage for
more than half an hour before a panel of three. LUCK also should favour.Any way ALL THE BEST to all
for your respective endeavours.
Please somebody reply me, if possible , why i failed seeing my answers . 
bye,
Sriharsha
