  lead in the creation, development and manufacture of the industry's most 
  advanced information technologies, including <STRONG>computer systems, 
  software, networking systems, storage devices and 
  microelectronics.</STRONG>IBM brings its products and services&nbsp; through 
  IBM India and IBM Global Services.<BR><BR>IBM India's product portfolio 
  includes the IBM PC, Aptiva home computer , ThinkPad portables, RS/6000, 
  AS/400e, S/390 and Netfinity servers, network computers, printers, networking 
  and storage products. IBM's software offerings include DB2, Lotus, Tivoli, MQ 
  Series and a range of Internet software like WebSphere and 
  SecureWay.<BR><BR>India is also home to <STRONG>two select IBM 
  centers</STRONG> - the <STRONG>IBM Solutions Research Center</STRONG> at 
  <STRONG>New Delhi</STRONG> and the <STRONG>Solutions Partnership Center (SPC) 
  </STRONG>at <STRONG>Bangalore</STRONG>. The SRC (only the eighth of its kind 
  across the globe) is an extended arm of IBM Research activities. As part of

<P><FONT size=3>The current pay package is around Rs. <STRONG>20,000</STRONG>. 
IBM is on spree of increasing its male/female ratio in its workforce 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hence female 
candidates are being given a slight advantage over their male 
counterparts.<BR></FONT></P>
