                     PAPER-97
               ___________________

                    TELCO   
			Telco was over here.gd and Interview will be tomorrow.
For S/W persons test is as follows.
	There are two sections each containg 40 questions.One arthematic 
and another is reasoning. In arthematic 11 are data sufficiency and 8 are 
anology.In reasoning all are puzzle type. Probably he rejects very
few from test , since after that GD follows. Any I am sending some q's as for
as my rememberance.
		Arthematic
1) Hypothesis :problem (below 4 he will give)
2) Mirror:Image
3)money:Misapprobation
4)nackles:Adoration
5)construction:building
6)file:pile
7)ours:we
8)1/3,1 1/3,3,5 1/3, next
9)Selling price of 4 articles=Cost price of 3 articles then %loss(ans. 25%)
10)|x-3|=3-x then x=
11)data sufficiency  p>q?
	1)p,q positive
	2)q-1=q*2+p
This type you can see in GMAT book.
	Reasoning
1)	ABCDEF attended for an interview, in which 3 were selected
A is worst of the lot
C got equal marks as F(C=F)
D<F and G
E is not selected 
B>C
There are 5 questions below this.
2)There are 7 fellows sat in the following way
C and F always sit as a apart as follows
No. of fellows sat b/w c and D and D and F are equal like that he has given
Ans: Order is as follows C E B D A G F by using this you can answer all
About 4 to 5 are there
3)ABCDE are five brothers. There are twins(only one pair of equal age)
both are neither younger nor older. D is younger to 3 brothers.
B is older than E and C.
q's like who is youngest? Eldest ? About 4 are there.
4)A person has meet a king for that ha has to cross 7 gates. At each gate he 
has to pay half the amount he is carrying. Finally he gave Rs 3/- to the 
king. Then the amount he carried at the beginning and some questions 
(about 5)like that.
5) Heros tell truth and cowards lie.There PQR three persons. P tells Q "I 
may be hero or I may be coward". Q tells R "P was telling that he was 
coward. Then R tells Q "P was not a coward but he was a hero". You better 
study the question it may not be entirely correct.
In thus 3 q"s are there
 				
If want to go for hardcore there wont"be any  test direct GD and interview

Best of luck

The paper consists os three sections.
1. aptitude 15 questions 20 min.
2. system concepts 20 questions 20 min.
3. 'c'   15 questions 20 min.

NOTE:::::

I'm sendin the questions, somany have no answers. U do check the
answers  for all the given questions also.

All questions are MULTIPLE CHOICES ONLY.

U do try to cover the related topics to get some understanding.
In interview They are asking C C++ Operating system concepts
and Networks.
They will ask about Ur interesting subjects, U try to have good
grip on those intresting subjects.

They selected 11 out of 55 students.
 They asked about c c++ project work and OS,NETWORKS.
But they selected only 2 , one from CS and another is BTech ECE.


SECTION 1 is main factor selection to the interview


--------------------------------------------------------------
In the interveiw you should be very active .And should be frank to say 
no also.One CS student said that he don't know NETWORK and he hasn't 
taken NETWORKS subject.But he has selected.
      OK  BEST OF LUCK.

 main()
 {
 int *p,*q;
  int i;
  p=num;
  q=num+2;
  i=*p++;
  print the value of i, and q-p, and some other operations are there.
  }
  how the values will change??
3. One pointer diff is given like this:
  int *(*p[10])(char *, char*)
  asked to find the    meaning.

.  If you sum their ages . it is exactly same as  my  neighbour's 
door number on my left. The  sacond  mathematiciaan  verfies  the 
door number and says that the not sufficient  .  Then  the  first 
says " o.k one more clue is that my youngest is the youngest"
Immmediately the second mathematician answers . Can  you  aanswer
