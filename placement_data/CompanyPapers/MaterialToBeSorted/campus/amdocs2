Hi Folks,
This is something I got regarding Amdocs.
Well, no claims that this is THE pattern. This is what
I have got and perhaps may help you in preparing. 

Good Luck

PATTERN OF AMDOCS PAPER 
SECTION - I: LETTER REASONING. (36 QUESTIONS)
	TIME:30 MINUTES    
SECTION- II: FAULT FINDING TEST (36 QUESTIONS)
                 TIME: 20 MINUTES.
SECTION -III: DIAGRAMATIC REASONING TEST (36
QUESTIONS)
                 TIME : 20 MINUTES.
SECTION -IV : COMPUTER CHECKING TEST (60 QUESTIONS)
                 TIME: 7 MINUTES.           
SECTION -V : PROGRAMMING SKILLS TEST (30 QUESTIONS)
                (25 COMPULSORY + 5 OPTIONAL Q'S)
                TIME: 90 MINUTES.
Section: 1
36 qs,30 min.
sample:

FGH

    ``
ABC=> + => => =>BAA

FG 

RRQP

Then:
TUV=> => => =>?

VUT 

Section :2
36 ques 20 min,FAULT FINDING
This is a tough section and there r some coloured
lights.The lights 
pass from certain 
machines and at last the output is given.You have to
find which machine 
is not active.
 don't panic u'll get enough time to grasp these in
the example time 
given.

SECTION:3
36qs,20 min DIAGRAMMATIC REASONING :
This section aims at finding the resultant figure
obtained after 
passing 
Through some special symbols (2 in no.)
Process box: When figure is input to this box the
corresponding 
shape,size,
and color attribute changes according to marked X .
Check Box: it compares the input figure with the
comparison
Figure .comparison is done of the attribute marked by
? 
In the symbol.

SECTION:4
60qs this is the easiest section

MATCHMAKING:
60 question in 7 minutes.
u can attempt all as question is very easy (negative
marking)
1:AM%:$69
match with

a: BM%:$69
b: AM%:$69->correct
c: AM%:69
d: AM%:$59

section:5
technical test.
this is very easy test. you will get enough time.
  A language made up of c and pascal is givenAnd 30 qs
follow.
25 carry marks and 5 are bonus i.e. if two people get
the same
 marks one getting more bonuses right will be in a
advantageous
 position. If u have learned c well don't waste much
time reading the
 language as it is like c. go back to it when
answering qs.
 Try to get as many correctly as possible.

note--->questions are not in same order
30 qs, 90 min
***********
a program is given and u have to find count
ans of first question is 3 and next question ans is
0(believe me).

1:input string 1011011100010
a long program is given and u'll have to find out the
a count
answer given here is =3.
2:the string is changed to 10101010101010 and u'll
have to find the 
count again.
ans-0
3: if not C1 AND NOT C2 AND NOT C3 AND NOT C4=?
answer given here is =if not(c1or c2 or c3 or c4).
4:given a program on input string what will be printed
answer given here is =GOOD GOLD
5: answer given here is =CANNY
7:similar qs
answer given here is =HELLO
****a program of binary search is given
ans
1-mean=(top+bottom)/2
2=mean
3 top=min+1
4-bottom=mean-1
*********
8:A PROGRAM on fibonacci series u'll have to find out
the changes to be 
made.
** in this quwstion in a line given
ans-->(c).change both 1,2.
in next question intialise sum=2;
*************
9.a program to cheque a palindrom(1253521)
it is very easy,
ans-
1 temp=n
2 temp >0
3 mod(temp,10)
4 temp/10
************
10.if a program looks like this|do|do|do| |do|do| |
ans->c
plz verify the ans also
**************** 
1) PROGRAMMING TEST:
   program- One to find whether no. is perfect or not.
eg. 28 = 1+2+4+7+14 (sum of factors excluding no.)
ans-
************** 
for i=2 to n/2 step 1
if mod(n ,i)=0
then sum=sum+i
endif
endfor
if sum<>n
then return 0(not perfect)
else
return 1(perfect)
*****************
If a program will be like this :
sum=0;
n=1373232;
w=12121212;
prod=mod(w,10)*mod(n,10);
sum=sum+prod;
if prod>9-------
-------
ans= (a)4        (b)5

EXAMPLE:
The following program reads 100 integers and displays
the 
no. of appearances of Even and Odd nos. resp.
MAIN()
INTEGER in,odds=0,evens = 0,i
    FOR i = ???????
    READ in
IF ????? = 0
       evens = evens + 1
    else 
       odds = odds + 1
    ENDIF
    ENDFOR
    PRINT evens,odds
ENDMAIN

A) What does the ??????in line 3 represent?
i) i = 1 TO 100 STEP 1
ii) i = 1 TO 100 STEP 2 Correct ans: (i)
iii) i = 1 TO 100 
iv) None of these

B) What does the ????? in line 5 represent?
i) in/2
ii) MOD(in,10) 
iii) MOD(in,2) Correct ans ; (iii)
iv) in
THESE ARE THE TYPE OF TEST QUESTIONS YOU WILL
ENCOUNTER.
