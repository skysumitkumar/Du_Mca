****************************************************

Technical :1) Write through cache --   x : reading is done from cache
   y : writing is done only to cache , not to memory
     .... x correct , y correct , both, none
2) Order of deletion in ordered binary tree -- n, logn, n log n
3) Best Sort complexity for average case -- Heap, Bubble, Binary, none
4) which is not a sort -- heap, fast, quick, bubble
5) In DHCP, addresses are stored as -- scopes, notes, ranges, ...
6) Speed of 3G UMTS -- 1 GBPS, 100 kbps, 64 kbps
7) Ethernet
    x : is deterministic response time    y : is collision free
    both correct, none, x , or y
8) 1 question on Context free grammar , which one is ambiguous -- given4
  options.
9) 1 question on Finite Automation Machine & Non FMA -- 4 options 
10) Disk scheduling is the job of    OS, Disk Controller, both , none
11)TCP is slower than UDP coz -- 3 options   4th option : TCP is faster
12) #define MUL(x,y)  (x * y)    #define N 3    c = MUL(n-1,n+2)
13) #define max ( a > b ? a : b)    i = 2 , j = 3    k = max(i++,j++)
   find i,j,k
14) char s[4] ;    strcpy(str,"hello");    printf("%s",str);
    will print hell, hello, hell & junk , program will crash
