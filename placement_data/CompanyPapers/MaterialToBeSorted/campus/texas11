u have to attempt any two sections.
for correct ans +1 mark, for wrong ans -0.5

1. A hash table has two alternative sizes for choosing the number of 
buckets. What is the optimal size of number of buckets which are 
evenly distributed the elements are unsigned integers.
a. 21 b. 32 c. 50 d. 100

2. 
  int fun() {

  }
  main() { 
  f=&fun();
  }
 what is the type of f.
 a......
 b.
 c.
 d.
  ans: pointer to a function returning int
3. #define f1 a*b
   #define f2 a+b

   main()
   {
        int i,j=10;
	i=f1(j,f2(10,10));
        printf("%d ",i);
   }
   what is the output
   a. 200 b. 100 c. 110 d. 120
  ans:- 110
4. 
  int j=0;
  while (i & i-1) {
      j++;   
   }
  
what is the value of j at the end of pgm for i=100;
 a. 100 b. 99 c. 2 d. 3
ans:-2
5. this pgm is rurn with no arguments what is the result
   main(int argc, char* argv[])
   {
       while(--argc) {

       printf("%s \n",++argv[argc]);
       }
   }

a. never enters into the loop
b. prints pgm name
c. prints new lines
d. do nothing
ans:- a

and another 5 questions like this very simple ones.

--------------------------------------------------

1. A two way associative cache of size 8192 divided into blocks of size 
32 bytes. the virtual mem size is 32 bit
  ---------------------------------
  | x cache | Y set  | Z offset    |
  ---------------------------------
   <----   32  ------------------->
  what are the vals of x,y,z
a. 20,5,7   b. 21,5,7 c. 20,7,5   d. 21,7,5

2.there are 255 instructions, with 16 registers 
  the opcode of the inst has following
   - type of inst (one of 255)
   - two register operands
   - addressing modes for s/d (there are 5 modes)
   - control flag
 
   what is the size of opcode
   a. 24 b. 32 c. 36 d.....
3.
  a+b = some bin num, (-a)+(-b)=another bin num
  in what form the numbers are represented
  a. signed 2's complement b. signed ones complement c. signed 
   magnitude ....
4. in Microprocessor What is the relation ship between memory width(A)
   and data bus (D).
  a. A=D b. A>D c. A<D d. none
5. what is the best addressing mode for the following code
 
   for(i=0;i<j;i++) {
      a[i*k]=b[i*k]+c[*k];
   }
  
   a. absolute b. auto increment c. relative d. indexed
6. two 16 bit signed X signed numbers , magnitude X magnitude form are 
 multiplied, then which of the following is true.

 a. two msbs are always 1 provided that , one of them is +ve.....
 b. two msbs are always same provided that they are represented in ...
 c. msb is 1 and seconf msb is 0 provided that ...
 d.  ......

7. similar to above, related to binary arithemetic
8. given one state diagram, s1 is the initial s2 is the final state
 
                     1/0
     0/0            |->|
     -->            |  |
     | |          ------|
    _|_|_   1/1   |     |---> 0/1
   | s1 | ------->| s2  |<--| 
   ------         |-----|

  What does this represent
  a. 2' complement from LSB
  b. 2's complement
  c. 1's complement
  d. none
 Ans:- a
                  
nother 2 question which i didnot remembered, they are simple than 
above ones.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
part3:-
 
 these are from digital logic design
  mainly on flipflops, gates, counters,...
-------------------------------------------
part 4
 analog design
 related to electronic devises and circuits

Time:- 60 min, No nagative marks
PAPER -2:- 75 questions of aptitude (almost all arithmetic)

1. first 4 question on predicate logic (DM)
   given some facts and some conclusion question is whether conclusion 
 is following, contradicting, may/may not the given facts.
2. later 5-6 questions given prises of some items in current/previous 
 month, and rate incresed/decreased compared to current/previous month 
is given. Then few question on them.
3. floor and ceil of x is defined as some fun of x, x mod y is defined
 in their own way.
 and some question given some arithmetic on above functions
4. passage is given, questions...
5. simple arithmetic on numericals
6. integration of e power sinx
7. some differentiation, simple
person A has solved the roots of quadratic eq by mistakenly taking
constant term and got as (,). B got as (,) by mistakenly taking the 
x coefficient term. What are the actual roots
Ans:- use product of root, sum of root formule

....
All most remaining all are simple arithmetic only.
