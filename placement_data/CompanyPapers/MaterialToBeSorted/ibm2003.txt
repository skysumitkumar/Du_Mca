not tough and they are asking basically basics in technical arena.
They were concentrating on C (students being asked to write some
programs in C , specially those related with strings), DBMS and OS.

interview you have to convince them about your desire to start your
career with IBM. Total 2 panels were there , in one of the panel they
asked GK also related to IT and general arena. They also asked your
areas of interests and for the same reason they asked questions in
mathematics to one student who have earlier stated
Written Test
=========
The paper contains total 40 questions. Duration 1 hour.
20 ques from apptitude (R.S.Agarwal is more than enough for IBM 
apps.)
20 questions from technical OS, DBMS, C++, Software Engineering 
etc.
======================================================================
=====
Apptitude:
======================================================================
=====
1. If A can do a particular work in 8 days. B can do the work in 6 
days. By C joining with them, they can finish the work in 3 days. 
If Rs.540 was paid to them, what is the share of C?
Ans : 1/8 * 540
1/8 + 1/6 + c = 1/3 ==> c = 1/24
1/8 : 1/6 : 1/24 ==> 3 : 4 : 1
C's share = 1/8 * 540 = 67.5
2. By selling a product a seller is gaining 10%. If he sell that 
product 
Rs.80 less, he would have been losing 10%. What is the cost price?
Ans : 400 /-
3. If A dricer drives a car four times a lap 10,20 30,60 kmph what 
is his average speed.
Ans : 4d / ( d/10 + d/20 + d/30 + d/60 ) = 20
4. If M persons are going for a party, then their share is $D. If 
three persons were absent, then how much share will be increased 
for each individual.
Solution : Average = D/M. Three absent New average = D/M-3
Increase = Newaverage - Average = D/M-3 - D/M 
5. If the radious is increased by 50%. How much will be the volume 
increased for a Sphere in percentage.
Ans : (1.5)^3 - 1 = 3.375 - 1 = 2.375 i.e. 237.5 %
6. One person is wearing Black and White shoes as his pair. If he 
is having 20 white and 20 Black shoes. What will be the less 
number of time he have try to take his correct pair of shoes.
Ans : may be ( 20 + 10 + 1 ) = 31
7. The age of the grand father is the sum of his three grandsuns. 
The second is 2 year younger than first one and the third one is 2 
year younger than the second one. Then what will be the age of the 
grandfather.
8. in a grass field, If there are 40 cows, they could eat for 40 
days. If there are 30 cows, they could eat for 60 days. Than if 20 
cows, How much day they could eat?
Ans : x + 40 * y = 40 * 40 
( x = current gross , y = daily increase in gross )
x + 60 * y = 30 * 60
solve these two equations , y = 10 , x = 1200
x + d * y = 20 * d ==> 1200 + d * 10 = 20 * d
==> d = 120 days
ANS : 120 days
9. If the size of the fruit is two times the size of the seed. 
Then what is the volume of the seed. (derive general equation)
Ans : radius of fruit = r and radius of seed = r/2
Volume of seed = Pi * (r/2)^3 = 1/8 * ( Pi * r^3 )
10. Speed of boat in still water 10 kmph.If the boat takes 24hr in 
up stream and 16hr in down stream to cross the same distance, then 
what will be the distance covered.
Ans : 192 Km
11. How many times do the hands of the clock coincide in a day?
Ans : 22 times b'coz 11 times for every 12 hrs ( 11 - 12 == 12 - 1 )
12. If a person is standing in room, that is having mirrors in all 
the four walls. How many images of the person will appear.
Ans : Infinity
