                             14.Questions like
                             There are 4 sets of statements and each set with 3 statements .Identify
                             the set
                             in which the first 2 sentences can be used to infer the third
                                    Eg:
                             1. All ATMs are in France.No PTMs are in France
                                       No PTMs are ATMs
                             2. All ATMs are in France.No PTMs are in France
                                No ATMs are  PTMs
                             You can see that in 1., if a PTM is an ATM,it should be in
                             FranceTherefore
                             1 is the answer
