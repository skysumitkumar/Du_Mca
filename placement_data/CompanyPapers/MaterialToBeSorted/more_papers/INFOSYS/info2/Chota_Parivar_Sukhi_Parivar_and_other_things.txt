Dear Friends,

I could attend the "Quantitative Faculty Training Programme" by 
Career Launcher at Mumbai for 4 out of the scheduled 7 days. Out 
of which the first 3 days were purely orgasm as to the number of 
fundae I was exposed to (last day was farewell and our tests). We 
were put up at a stud place called Raigad Resorts with A/C rooms, 
buffet food and even a swimming pool thrown in. Considering the 
gruelling 12hr workschedule we underwent (and about 4hrs of 
homework) I guess we made good use of whatever recreation we could 
get. :)

Coming to the point. Im no Quanti Stud like Manish or Chandra from 
CL Mumbai. Nor a Shivku from Delhi. These guys are like God in 
Quanti. But I did get to imbibe a few great fundae which I will 
try passing on to you.

The first and foremost thing I learnt was the amazing CPSP formula 
by Manish which is the Chota Parivar Sukhi Parivar formula. It 
states that if a rule is valid of say n=1,2,3,... then it usually 
is valid for all values of n. As an example lets see the following 
sum :

If we convert (2 to the power 81) minus 1 into binary. How many 1s 
will you have ?

Got zapped eh ? This is where CPSP comes into play. Lets see :

2 raised to 1 minus 1 = 2 -1 = 1 (decimal) = 1 (bin)
2 raised to 2 minus 1 = 4-1 = 3 (decimal) = 11 (bin)
2 raised to 3 minus 1 = 8 - 1 = 7 (decimal) = 111 (bin)
and so on..............

Thats all, now by CPSP we can safely conclude that it holds true 
for these then for
2 raised to n minus 1 = someno. = 111........81 1s (bin)

Kewl eh ? But junta stick to arithmetic dont use this in algebra 
as u might be jacked in that. But for arithmetic you can safely 
assume that for normal range if it works for lower values it will 
definitely work for higher values.

I think Biswajit had sent some good problems to get your brains 
working. I would however add a few suggestions :

*********************************************************************************
1.A tennis championship is played on a knock-out basis, i.e., a 
player is out of the tournament when he loses a match.
(a) How many players participate in the tournament if 127  matches 
are totally played?  (b) How many matches are played in the 
tournament if 40  players totally participate?

Answers: (a) 128   (b) 39

*********************************************************************************

ANY QUESTION WHICH TALKS ABOUT A KNOCK-OUT BASIS FOR ELIMINATION 
GOES BY THE FORMULA (N-1) GAMES REQUIRED FOR N PLAYERS.

BLINDLY FOLLOW THIS FUNDA. U WILL SAVE ENORMOUS TIME. MAKE SURE 
NOT TO CONFUSE WITH 'ROUND ROBIN' BASIS.

2.It was Cheryl's first day at school. The teacher suggested that 
it would be a good idea for each child to meet every other child 
in the class. The teacher said, "When you meet, please shake hands 
and introduce yourself by name."
If there were 7  children in the class, how many total 
handshakes
were there?   21

*********************************************************************************

I DONT KNOW WHY I VISUALIZE THESE KINDS OF PROBLEMS (OTHER 
VARIANTS BEING NO. MATCHES PLAYED IN A TOURNEY ETC.) AS TRYING TO 
JOIN THE DIFFERENT SIDES OF A HEXAGON. JUST TRY TO DRAW A MENTAL 
IMAGE AND YOU WILL SEE ITS 5 + 4+ 3 +......

10. Last weekend, I went to play in the nearby park. It was real 
fun! I rode my new bicycle that Mom had gifted me on my birthday. 
On reaching the park, I saw that there were a total of 14  
bicycles and tricycles. If the total number of wheels was 37 , how 
many tricycles were there?   9

Solution:
Assuming 2 wheels for each cycle, 14  cycles will have 28  wheels. 
But, there are 37  - 28  = 9  extra wheels. As bicycles have 2 
wheels and tricycles have 3 wheels, there is 1
extra wheel per tricycle in the park. Thus, the 9  extra wheels 
belong to 9 tricycles.

METHINKS, A SIMPLER AND MORE STRAIGHTFORWARD SOLUTION IS SOLVING 
THE FOLLOWING TWO EQUATIONS WHERE X & Y ARE THE NUMBER OF BICYCLES 
AND TRICYCLES RESPECTIVELY

X + Y     = 14
2X + 3Y = 37
