</ul>

<p>The written test is of two parts:</p>

<p><b>Section A </b>: Aptitude Test<br>
<b>Section B </b>: Technical Test</p>

<p>The <b> aptitude </b>is a mixture of verbal, analytical and quantitative
questions. It is based on a pattern similar to the CAT and GRE tests. Also
questions on the patterns of these in R.S Agarwal can be practiced.</p>

<p>The <b>technical section </b>tests your knowledge in <b>C with Data
Structures and Pointers, Computer Networks, DBMS </b>and <b>Operating Systems</b></p>

<p>People with <b>electronics </b>background can expect to be tested on <b>core
subjects.</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;The information on the interview is pretty sketchy but it consists mainly of technical
grilling. We would suggest that you take a look at the <a href="../Intsec.htm">Interview
section.</a> to get a better idea and view some useful tips for taking interviews.</p>
