campus/honewell ustar   prithvi  HONEYWELL 

Here is the questions that was asked to one of my ms friends in
last years campus interview (Honeywell).
This was not included in the database in ~mrb.
/***************************************************************/
Hi MRB,
                I am out of placement after getting selection in Honeywell,
which was my dream job.

Honeywell conducted a test in IIT and Interview was in their
office at B'lore.

Test contained 100 multiple choice questions divided into

                a) Verbal ability  (15 ques)
                b) Numerical aptitude (15 )
                c) Logical and analytical ability (15)
                d) Elementary computer science (10)
                d) Programming langauages (20)
                e) Operatins systems and Data structures (25)

Not sure about the number of questions.

Verbal ability questions contained 3 parts. 
a) One passage is given and U have to answer 5 questions
b) Some words are given and their synonyms have to be written
c) 

Numerical aptitude and Logical questions were the usual stuff.
---------------------------------------------------------------
I had 4 rounds of interview.
First round (around 45 minutes) contained, questions from Real-time
-----------
Systems (my research area), operating systems and Software Engineering

Explain U'r research work.

What is a Real-Time System ?
What is the difference between Hard and Soft real-time systems ?
What is a mission critical system ?
What is the important aspect of a real-time system ?

Explain the difference between microkernel and macro kernel.
Give an example of microkernel.
Why paging is used ?
Which is the best page replacement algo and Why ?

WHat is software life cycle ?
How much time is spent usually in each phases  and why ?
Which one do U want to work if selected in Honeywell ?
( I said I don't like testing )
They asked why ? 
I said it is a boring job. Then they tried to analyse
the knowledge in testing.

What is testing ?
Which are the different types of testing ?
Then they explained the way they do testing. They said that they are
doing testing in requirement phase and design phase so that if any
problem comes in those phases it is not ncecessary to go back and change
the requirement or design. All the test processing is automated.

Why do U want to join Honeywell ?
Ans : To get a practical feeling of Real-time systems. 

Do U know C++ ?
How good are U in C and C++ ?
Rate U'rslef in both C and C++. ( 1 - 10 marks)

Second round (around 45 minutes ) 
------------
They wanted a bio-data at the time of inteview. I gave the placement
office bio-data and in that one there was column 'Major subjects
studied'. Many of the questions came from those.

Explain U'r research work.
Lot of questions from it.

What is a distributed system ?
Some questions about CSP. ( I kept quiet)
Which languages do U know ?
What are the differences between Pascal and C.
I said Pascal is a strongly typed language.
Then what is typing  and its advantages ?
Then he asked some questions from Compiler construction and Lisp.

WHich are the different computer architectures ?
What is the requirement in MIMD ?
What is the difference between RISC and CISC processors ?
Difference between loosely coupled and tightly coupled systems ?
What is an open system ?

Still a lot of questions from software engineering .
Which are the different phases in Software life cycle (asked again)
Why is analysis and testing phases very important ?
Which methodologies are U familiar with ?

Have U worked in windows ? (Yes)
What is the difference U have seen from a Dos environment ?
I said it event driven .
So what do U mean by event driven ?
How do WinMain look like ?
How the messages are processed in Windows ?
(Queue of events)
What are parameters needed to distinguish an event ?

Have U done any network programming ?
Why networks are layered ?
What is the advantage of that ?
How many layers are there in OSI ?
WHy is it called OSI model ?
Are U familiar with network topologies ?
Which are the different network toplogies ?
Tell an example of bus type network.
I said ethernet.
What is the Bandwidth of ethernet ?
Explain the advantage and disadvantage of ethernet ?
Which is the protocol used in ethernet. (CSMA/CD)
Why is it called so ?
If all stations tries to communicate at same time, what will happen.
What is binary exponential backoff algo ?

What is the advantage of Ring network ?
Compare it with ethernet.
In a real-time system which one do U prefer and why ?
What is the basic requirement of a real-time network ?
Which one is costly - ethernet of ring networks ?

Some questions form OOSD and Digital signal processing.
What is inheritance, encapsulation etc.

Third Round (15 minutes)
-----------
Asked about the percentages and marks during SSC, PDC, B.Tech and MS.
When can U join ?
Who is U'r guide ?
U are from which place ?
Where is it in Kerala ?
How do U perform in the first two interviews ?
WHy have U given Honeywell as dream job ?
Some more personal questions

Fourth Round (45 minutes)
------------
What do U like in Bangalore ?
I said the weather and all my friends are here.
Asked about my family members.
How do  U interact with friends ?
How do adjust to a new environemnt ?
Suppose U solve a problem and after that U are getting an almost same
problem with high complexity ( and lower complexity). How will U
approach to the next problem. 
What is U'r approach towards a new subject ?
How do U prepare for exams ?
Suppose in a project meeting, somebody fires U, how will U react ?
Are U patient enought to wait in long queues ?
Still some more which I don't rememebr.....


VERIFONE

Verifone test Questions :

There are two parts :
Note: The Answers given here are what i wrote, May not be correct.

1. Aptitute test        :  15 Minutes, 20 Questions

        Towards the middle questions are easy than from the front.

        eg.  Product of three consecutive nos. 210.  What is the sum
                of two least numbers?
                ans.: 5 * 6 * 7 = 210 , sum = 11 is answer

        eg.  If the area of the sqaure is increased by 69 % how
                much the length of the side will increase?

                  ans.: 13 (i think)
        eg.  if the sum of five consecutive nos. 35? how many prime nos
                are there :
                 
                ans: 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 35  so two primes

VERITAS PAPER  24th July, 2000 IN IIT BOMBAY
============================================

It was a 1 hr test.	100 marks!
*Section 1
	20 questions	objective, negative marking(2 correct, -1
						incorrect)


Questions were pretty ok. covered topics like OS,C,data structures...

	*What is TLB? 	(meaning translation lookaside buffer)
	*Which cannot be swapped from a system which uses
	only tape as the backup store?
		-page fault handler
		-file system
		-disk drive controller
		-alll of the above.
	*Probablity that 2 aces will appear in a set of cards when
	picked?
	*Which variables are put in the stack?
		-auto
		-static
		-global
	*Which causes a page fault?(or rather where a page fault can
		occur?)
		-MMU
		-DMA
		-Cache controller
		-none of the above.
	*Which is not the stable sorting method?
		-quicksort
		-bubblesort
		-selection sort
		-none of the above

*Section 2
----------
	5 questions	subjective

Question 1
----------
(5 marks each)

	It had 4 questions, all on bitwise operators.
	We had to answer value of a variable j
	in terms of a varibale i and a constant 

for(i=0,j=0;i<100;i++)
{
	j&=i;
	if(!j)
	{i&=i-1}
}

	i cannnot remember exactly, but such questions...
	which got complicated with ex-or operators, etc....
	
Question 2:
------------
(7 marks each)

	This had 2 questions which had 2 C programs
	and u have to find whether they behave properly.
	If u have a found a mistake then it can be rectified
	modifying a single line of code.


well i didn't read ques 3 and 4:(
Question 3
----------
(8 marks)
	
Question 4
----------
(7 marks each)
	a) It was deriving the program complexity
		or the order of the pgm
		of a program which was a C linked list
		complicated program
	b) was to provide solution as to how to decrease
		the order!

i will ask my friends who have passed and let u know by tomorrow
about these questions

They did give us 15 mins extra....:)
---------------------------------------------------------------


Q.3
  write a code using given instruction to
  increment the content of memory location M by 1.
  
  as a hint they have given that this is possible in 6 clock cycle......

campus/veritas11 : addition to veritas paper 24th july 2000 in iit bombay

Q. No. 3.  A micropro. supports following instructions.
 
 1. add/or/exor  A,B add ato b and store result in A 1 cycle.
 2. not   A                        1 cycle
 3. mov  A,B     move A to B
 4.???????

  A,B can be register or memory..
  can't be immediate......

  increment the content of memory location M in mimimum clock cycle(
  i.e. 6).
  instructions involving memory involve extra 2 cycle for load and store.
   there r 2 register...

    c. link-time
    d. load-time

    15.
    two program is given of factorial.
    one  with  recursion and one without recursion .
    question was which program won't run for very big no. input     because
of stack overfow .
    a. i only  (ans.)
    b. ii only
    c. i& ii both .
    c. none

    16.
    struct a
    {
    int a;
    char b;
    int c;
    }

    union b
    {
    char a;
    int b;
    int c;
    };
    which is correct .
    a. size of a is always diff. form size of b.(ans.)
    b. size of a is always same  form size of b.
    c. we can't say anything because of not-homogeneous (not in ordered)
    d. size of a can be same if ...

Some paps from infy are repeated as they are from diff sources. BEST OF LUCK. AND PLEASE SEND ME THE STUFF U HAVE GOT.

INFOSYS (12/07/2001) IIT Bombay
               ------------------------------- 

This paper has 10 questions.(time 1 hour)

1) A's family has some children(both boys & girls). Each boy has as
many sisters as his brothers and each girl has twice as many brothers
as her sisters. How many boys & girls are there?

ans:4,3    (shakuntala devi book)          3 marks


2) Now the time is 3.15 a.m. What is the angle between the hours
hand and minutes hand ?

ans : 7.5 degrees                          3 marks


3)A bus can travel at a max speed of 100 kmph. It's speed decreases
 in proportion with the numbers of passengers on board. If the bus speed
is 88 kmph when there are 3 passengers, what is the speed when there are
6 passengers ?                             4 marks

4)there are two cities A & B 99 km apart. Between A & B there are 98
kilometer posts.On each kilometer post is marked the distance to A & B
from that particular post. how many kilometer posts are there which are
marked with only two digits;(example:  A33/B66 .this post has only 3 and
6 digits)

ans: 17                                  5 marks

5)In a sweet shop 5 boxes contain laddoos and one box contain halwas.
The 6 boxes contain 15, 16, 18, 19, 20 and 31 sweets.Mr A comes and buys
two boxes of laddoos. Then Mr.B comes and buys three boxes laddoos
which totals twice that of Mr A bought.Now the box with halwas is left.
how many halwas are left ?

6)(x-a)(x-b)..................(x-y)(x-z)=  ?

7)Four girls are comparing their prizes won in the last bench of a 
classroom.One of the girls Bharathi said to one girl " i got one more than 
you". Then another girl said to some other girl "i got two more than you",
Next another girl said " i got three more than you", again another girl
said " i got four more than you",another said " i got 5 more than you",
another said "i got 6 mor than you". Nobody knows which girl is talking to
whom. Total all the four girls won 27 prizes. How many did Bharathi won?   

                                                               6 marks

8) A girl has 77 empty coke bottles. A shopkeeper gives one full bottle
for 5 empty bottles. How many full bottles can the girl get ? 

9)I don't remember this question exactly. It is about 4 friends naming
their dogs. Each person names their dogs from two of their neighbours.
five conditions have been given. you have to find the names of the dogs.
this que is for 6 marks.

10)This que is also much confusing. This is about 4 musicians attending
a remix contest. Each has a number written on their back. each wore
different  color shirts.their winning positions are given. eight
conditions were given which i am unable to recollect. you have to identify
their order of winning , their color of shirts and the numbers written
on their back.                                8 marks.





Part 2.   15 minutes     Essay contest.

Topics:

   Power and politics
         or
  How can you make education more useful to work life.



Interview questions:

1) Introduce yourself
2) Tell me something about your project
3) what is a linked list?
4) What is the difference between structure and union

                    15 or 16 bits correctly.

                     Quantitative aptitude:I am sending 15 questions.In the latest paper we got,
                      there r only 10 of them r present.Time 10 min.Marks 20.Do all the
                      problems correctly.

                      Reasoning:All answers r given.Remember them.In the exam, u willnot be
                      having time to read the passages.So remember the answers.
                      I dont remember twohe passages (R and Q).U can read these passages
                      in the exam and answer them.Remember: don't answer all questions.Write
                      7 or 8 incorrect answers.Time 45 min.Total 70 questions and Marks 70.

                      Your ultimate aim is to get 75 to 85 marks.Because if u get high marks,
                      they may assune that u know the paper beforehand and u may be disqualified.
                      So don't get morethan 90 marks.

                               WISH U ALL THE BEST.

there are 20 questions all in techinical paper and 36 questions in appititude te
st

in appititude thay have given all diagrams and asked to find what comes next

thay are quite easy and i hope if u practice r.s aggraval u can do it easily

for tecnical thay have given 1 hr for 20 questions and for not technical thay ha
ve given only 40 min
and 36 questions

this is the paper i have right now

1. main()
   {
    fork();
fork();
fork();
printf("\n hello");
}

How many times print command is executed?

2.main()
{
 int i,*j;
  i=5;
j=&i;
printf("\ni= %d",i);
 f(j);

printf("\n i= %d",i);
}

void f(int*j)
{
int k=10;
  j= &k;
}  

output is
a 5 10
b 10 5
c 5 5
d none

3.
  some question on pipeline like you have to findout the total time 
by which execution is completed for a pipeline of 5 stages.

4.

  main()
{
   int *s = "\0";

   if(strcmp(s,NULL)== 0)
     printf("\n s is null")p
    else
     printf("\n s is not null");
}

5. 
  some syntax which returns a pointer to function

6.  size of integer is
    a. 2 bytes
    b 4 bytes
    c. machine dependant
    d compiler dependent.

7.max and avg. height of sorted binary tree

a. logn n
b n logn

8.
  some question. like the number was shifted everytime by one and bitwise and with 10000000.
  one was supposed to find what the code was doing.
  I feel the answer was most probably finding decimal value.

9. int a[5][4]
   int is 2 bytes base address for array is 4000(Hexa)
   what will be addr for a[3][4]?
   int is 4 bytes same question.

10.
  implementation of priority queue
  a. tree
   b linked list 
    c doubly linked list.

 In written test in each section you have to get minimum marks i.e
 you have to pass in each section.  There will be questions from
 C, C++, JAVA. about 10 questions in C++ in the written test.




			HONEYWELL
     HONEYWELL 

Here is the questions that was asked to one of my ms friends in
last years campus interview (Honeywell).
This was not included in the database in ~mrb.
/***************************************************************/
Hi MRB,
		I am out of placement after getting selection in Honeywell,
which was my dream job.

Honeywell conducted a test in IIT and Interview was in their
office at B'lore.

Test contained 100 multiple choice questions divided into

		a) Verbal ability  (15 ques)
		b) Numerical aptitude (15 )
		c) Logical and analytical ability (15)
		d) Elementary computer science (10)
		d) Programming langauages (20)
		e) Operatins systems and Data structures (25)

Not sure about the number of questions.

Verbal ability questions contained 3 parts. 
a) One passage is given and U have to answer 5 questions
b) Some words are given and their synonyms have to be written
c) 

Numerical aptitude and Logical questions were the usual stuff.
---------------------------------------------------------------
I had 4 rounds of interview.
First round (around 45 minutes) contained, questions from Real-time
-----------
Systems (my research area), operating systems and Software Engineering

Explain U'r research work.

What is a Real-Time System ?
What is the difference between Hard and Soft real-time systems ?
What is a mission critical system ?
What is the important aspect of a real-time system ?

Explain the difference between microkernel and macro kernel.
Give an example of microkernel.
Why paging is used ?
Which is the best page replacement algo and Why ?

WHat is software life cycle ?
How much time is spent usually in each phases  and why ?
Which one do U want to work if selected in Honeywell ?
( I said I don't like testing )
They asked why ? 
I said it is a boring job. Then they tried to analyse
the knowledge in testing.

What is testing ?
Which are the different types of testing ?
Then they explained the way they do testing. They said that they are
doing testing in requirement phase and design phase so that if any
problem comes in those phases it is not ncecessary to go back and change
the requirement or design. All the test processing is automated.

Why do U want to join Honeywell ?
Ans : To get a practical feeling of Real-time systems. 

Do U know C++ ?
How good are U in C and C++ ?
Rate U'rslef in both C and C++. ( 1 - 10 marks)

Second round (around 45 minutes ) 
------------
They wanted a bio-data at the time of inteview. I gave the placement
office bio-data and in that one there was column 'Major subjects
studied'. Many of the questions came from those.

Explain U'r research work.
Lot of questions from it.

What is a distributed system ?

                  VSAT Overview

                  Why Use VSATs?

                  VSAT networks provide rapid, reliable satellite 
transmission of data, voice, and video to an unlimited number of geographically dispersed
                  sites or from these sites to headquarters.

                  What Equipment Do I Need for My VSAT Network?

                  Each site is equipped with a VSAT terminal consisting 
of an antenna, outdoor electronics mounted on the antenna for signal
                  reception/transmission, and indoor electronics 
for connection to customer computer, telephone, and video equipment.

This section aims at finding the resultant figure
obtained after 
passing 
Through some special symbols (2 in no.)
Process box: When figure is input to this box the
corresponding 
shape,size,
and color attribute changes according to marked X .
Check Box: it compares the input figure with the
comparison
Figure .comparison is done of the attribute marked by
? 
In the symbol.

SECTION:4
60qs this is the easiest section

MATCHMAKING:

follow.
25 carry marks and 5 are bonus i.e. if two people get
the same
 marks one getting more bonuses right will be in a
advantageous
 position. If u have learned c well don't waste much
time reading the
 language as it is like c. go back to it when
answering qs.
 Try to get as many correctly as possible.

note--->questions are not in same order
30 qs, 90 min

SECTION III - ANALYSIS PROGRAM SEGMENTS
---------------------------------------

1) Here is the structure declaration of a doubly linked list

struct dlink {
int nodeid;
struct dlink *next;
struct dlink *prev;
} dlink_t;

A pointer of the head of the linked list is maintained as a global variable,
whose definition is
dlink_t *head;

The funtion remove_element(dlink_t *rp), needs to remove the node pointed to
the rp and adjust the head.

The first node's prev and the last node's next are NULL.

remove_element(dlink_t *rp)
{
rp->prev->next = rp->next;
rp->next->prev = rp->prev;
if( head == rp)
head = rp->next;

Which of the following statement is true about the function remove_element

A) It work when head is the same as rp
B) It does not work when rp is the last element on the list
c) It sets the head of the list correctly
D) It works in all cases

Answer :B

2) Consider the following function written in c:

#define NULL 0

char *
index(sp,c)
register char *sp,c;
{
do {
if(*sp == c)
return (sp);
} while (*sp++);
return NULL;
}

The first argument sp, is a pointer to a C string. The second
argument, c, is a character. This function scarches for the character
c, in the string. If it is found a pointer to that location is returned
else NULL is returned.
This function works
a) Always
b) Always, but fails when the first byte contais the character c
c) works when c is a non NULL character only
d) Works only when the character c is found in the string

   M.N.R.E.C  TI PAPER   (2000)



   about all interviews in brief they are asking about n/w's so prepare well.

      20 tech q's    (1 hr)
    tech:
     multiple choice , q's are not in order

     1)Reentrant os required 
         a)multitasking
         b)multiuser 
         c)both
         d)none
     ans: c   (check)
  
     2)identify a DFA for all strings which ended with string '00'
             4 dfa's have given , u can simply identify
     3)dfa has given we have to find the string accepted by that.
    
     4)in a memory hierarchy, M1,M2
        M1 access time is 2 ns ,M2 accesstime is 100 ns . the hit ratio for 
        M1 is .97, then what's the avg access time
      ans: 500 ns

     5) Interrupts main use is for elimination of 
     a) spooling
     b)polling
     c)job scheduling
     d)....
    
     6)A coprocessor for floating point operations has given. after that the execution of the
       floating point ops has incresed by 20 times. if 20%  floating pt ops are there then
        what's the sped up?

     7)  two heaps of sizes m,n are given,
    then the time needed to merge them
    a)m
     b)n
    c)m+n
    d) none
  8)context switching is useful in

 9)  if 2^n leaves are given in a tree then no.of internal nodes 
   a)2^n
   b) 2^n -1
   c);......

10) semaphores used for 
  a)to prevent deadlocks
  b) to sycronize critical activities
  c)....
 
  remaining q's i have forgot, but some q's are about c (easy)

   u can do 18 q's in this section ( i.e this sec is that much easy)

anal:
    it's some what difficult.
  in this sec they has given big passeges, analytical reasoning,some apti bits
  i have forgot many of the q's
  so  i am giving here few q's
  but it's very easy to shortlist in this TI, if u done this sec well.

1) derivative of e^sinx
2)x=2yt y=2t^2
   dy/dx?    (figures may not correct)
    

  x mod y=x-y[x/y]
        =x-y{x/y}    some conditions are given
   [x/y] means floor operation.
   {x/y} ceal op.

based on this 4 or 5 q's are given u can do the all the q's except
  one q.
  that's why  iam giving only one q from this 
 
3)xmod 3=2, xmod5=10 then xmod15=?






  i can't give the remaining q's those are very lengthy i have forgot those.


about TI interview:
   
  Ti is asking v.....very basic fundaasssss
   for me they have asked only in c, but some other persi\ons they asked in ds,os,ip etc.

   in c they have asked
   if u have given a 32 bit no. u have to set m th bit without using any arithmetic ops
   and u must have to write in a single expr. (hint: use &,<< ops)
   they asked the same for reset.
  
  they have asked to print 2^0 to 2^16 with out using any arith. ops. (same as above)
if u have given two seperate c files u have toexecute these two in one by linking how 
 u can achieve this (hint: make utility)

about ds:
    they have asked how u can print levelwise in a tree (   hint: bfs)

campus/texas11
u have to attempt any two sections.
for correct ans +1 mark, for wrong ans -0.5

.................................................................................................
section 3:in this section you have only one question
...................................................................................

Write any three numbers in a row.It is always possible
to find a subset of adjucent numbers that add up to a
multiple of 3(that is either one,two or three numbers
that are next to each other).

for example (1):          5,7,1    5+7=12(multiple of
3)

example 2:                4,4,15   15 is multiple of 3

example 3:                5,11,2   5+11+2=18 is
multiple of 3

can you explain why and prove it ?what happens if you
write a long list of numbers(say ""n"" numbers).Is it 
always possible to find a subset of adjacent numbers
that add up to a multiple of ""n"".Can you explain why
and prove ????
