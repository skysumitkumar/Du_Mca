</ul>

<p><font color="#000000" size="3">The test is followed by a Technical and a HR
interview.The technical interview is highly specialised and covers almost all subjects you
have done in your curriculum. However one is required to name his/her favorite subject on
which most of the interview is focussed. For Computer Engineers C, Operating Systems,
DBMS, Microprocessors are mostly focussed upon. Electronics Engineers can be grilled on
DCLD, Microprocessors and Communications.For details on the frequently asked questions
please refer to our </font><a href="../Intsec.htm">Interview section</a><font
color="#000000" size="3">.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="3">The HR interview which follows the technical interview
is very general. The Hr interview is also important. Mostly questions are asked to test
your temperament. You maybe asked your opinion on a variety of current affair topics. We
were asked about Homosexuality, Lesbianism(the movie FIRE), Kashmir, Genome Project etc.
In some cases questions regarding the company are asked. For details on the other
frequently asked questions please refer to our <a href="../Intsec.htm">Interview section</a>.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="3"><strong>Tata Consultancy Services</strong> started in
1968.<strong> Mr.F.C Kohli</strong> who is presently the <strong>Deputy Chairman</strong>
was entrusted with the job of steering TCS. The early days marked TCS resonsibility in
managing the punch card operations of Tisco. The company, which was into management
consultancy from day one, soon felt the need to provide solutions to its clients as
well.TCS was the first Indian company to make forays into the US market with clients
ranging from <strong>IBM</strong>, <strong>American Express, Sega </strong>etc. TCS is

Y2K<strong> </strong>factory in Chennai as a short-term strategy. Now, with <strong>E-business</strong>

about 90 percent of TCS' revenue comes from <strong>consulting</strong>, while the rest
