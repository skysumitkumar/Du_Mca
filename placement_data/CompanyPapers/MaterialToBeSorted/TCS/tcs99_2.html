<BODY><XMP>                    In the paper I am sending,there r about 40 vocabulary questions.But
                    this year's paper has only 20 of them.Time 5 min.Marks 10.Do only
                    15 or 16 bits correctly.

                     Quantitative aptitude:I am sending 15 questions.In the latest paper we got,
                      there r only 10 of them r present.Time 10 min.Marks 20.Do all the
                      problems correctly.

                      Reasoning:All answers r given.Remember them.In the exam, u willnot be
                      having time to read the passages.So remember the answers.
                      I dont remember twohe passages (R and Q).U can read these passages
                      in the exam and answer them.Remember: don't answer all questions.Write
                      7 or 8 incorrect answers.Time 45 min.Total 70 questions and Marks 70.

                      Your ultimate aim is to get 75 to 85 marks.Because if u get high marks,
                      they may assune that u know the paper beforehand and u may be disqualified.
                      So don't get morethan 90 marks.

                               WISH U ALL THE BEST.
