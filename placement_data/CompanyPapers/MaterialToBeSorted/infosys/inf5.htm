2) A soldier looses his way in a thick jungle. At random he walks from his camp but
mathematically in an interesting fashion. First he walks one mile East then half mile to
North. Then 1/4 mile to West, then 1/8 mile to South and so on making a loop. <br>
Finally how far he is from his camp and in which direction. <br>
<br>
<font color="#D83D41">Ans: Distance travelled in north and south directions</font> <br>
<font color="#D83D41">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1/2 - 1/8 + 1/32 - 1/128
+ 1/512 - and so on</font> <br>
<font color="#D83D41">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = 1/2/((1-(-1/4))</font> <br>
<font color="#D83D41">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly in east and west
directions</font> <br>
<font color="#D83D41">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1- 1/4 + 1/16 - 1/64 +
1/256 - and so on</font> <br>
<font color="#D83D41">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = 1/(( 1- ( - 1/4))</font>

<strong>First</strong> : I have three childern. The product of their ages is 36. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you sum their ages, it is
exactly same as my neighbour's door number on my left. <br>
The second mathematician verfies the door number and says that it is not sufficient. <br>
Then the first says &quot; Ok one more clue is that my youngest is really the
youngest&quot;. Immmediately the second mathematician answers . <br>
Can you answer the question asked by the first mathematician? <br>
What are the childeren ages? <br>
<font color="#D83D41"><br>
Ans 1,6 and 6</font></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It takes 24 days for 70 cows and 60 days for 30 cows
to eat the whole of the grass.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How many cows are needed to eat the grass in 96
days.? <br>
<font color="#D83D41"><br>
Ans : 20 <br>
g - grass at the beginning <br>
r - rate at which grass grows, per day <br>
y - rate at which one cow eats grass, per day <br>
n - no of cows to eat the grass in 96 days<br>
g + 24*r = 70 * 24 * y <br>
g + 60*r = 30 * 60 * y <br>
g + 96*r = n * 96 * y <br>
Solving, n = 20. </font><br>
