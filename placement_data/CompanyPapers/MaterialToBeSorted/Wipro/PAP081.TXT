               THIS FILE CONTAINS THE QUESTIONS WHICH MS SCHOLARS FACED IN PLACEMENT
                                 INTERVIEWS IN 1994 AND 1995

               for(int i = 1; i <= 1; i++)
               {
                      Company name: Wipro Infotech Ltd., Bangalore.
                      Year: 1995

               Wipinfo has 2 rounds of interviews. The first round is fully technical.
               The second round, depending on the members of the board, may be
               technical,
               semi-technical or personal. Last year the second round was more technical
               than the first(!) and the board was headed by Mr. P.V.Sanjeeva
               Reddy, one of the no-nonsense, hardcore-technical, project leaders
               in Infotech. This year it was headed by Mr. Victor Jayakiran, G.M.
               (Technical, Global R&D) who was a much sober man and therefore spent
               most of the time in the second round dealing with personal questions.

               I detail here the technical questions asked in the first round --
               --------------------------------------------------------------

               [1] Tell us about your work in brief.
               My Ans. Mention first the title, followed by a brief overview of the
               work, what we plan to achieve, what has been achieved so far, finally
               the relevance/scope of the work to the related area (i.e. how is it
               going to be useful).    [ 5-10 mins. depending on interest of the
               listener.]

               [2..n] Questions related to the work.
               Ans. Area dependent. [ ~ 10 mins ]

               [n+1] Tell us what you know about DMA and why that is needed?
               My Ans. As usual, mentioned the wastage of CPU computation power spent
               in busy-waiting. Told how DMA works.

               [n+2] What are the various types of scheduling algo, what is used by
               UNIX?
               My Ans. Mentioned Round Robin, First-come-first-served,
               Shortest-job-first, Earliest-deadline-first, Least-laxity-first,
               Priority-based-event-driven. UNIX uses RR with multi-level feedback.

               [n+3] How can you implement SJF in UNIX?
               My Ans. Usually, SJF means that we know the job-duration in advance. In
               UNIX where we cannot know that, we have to make assumptions about that
               based on which we should initially schedule. Periodically however, we
               have to fine-tune our initial assumptions based on the times taken by
               various ready jobs, and recompute estimates and change the schedule
               accordingly.

               [n+4] Different types of subroutine calling conventions?
               My Ans. Call by value, reference, value-result.

               [n+5] Parameter passing sequence used by C?
               My Ans. Rightmost parameter pushed first on stack.

               [n+6] What is a page-fault and how is it handled in UNIX?
               My Ans. [Refer to MJBach, Ch. 9 for details].

               Personal questions in the first round --
               -------------------------------------

               1. What was your overall position in the Univ. in B.E.
               2. Why did you choose to join MS here. 3. How do you like the MS course.
               4. Anything you want to know about us.

               Technical Questions in the second round --
               ---------------------------------------

               [1] What are the current trends and areas of focus in IT.
               My Ans. Talked about emerging trends of S/W Engg and ISO 9000 stuff
               (gave vague ideas about them as I don't know much nor do I care 
               about these topics myself ;-)). Then mentioned the proliferation of O-O
               methodologies and their usefulness in speeding up development process,
               code re-usability, ease of maintenance, ease of bug-fixing.
               Thirdly, mentioned the work going on in High-Speed N/w - FDDI, ATM,
               Fast-Ethernet(100Mbps). Told whatever little I knew about ATM in
               response to another question.

               [2] What is a Micro-Kernel architecture.
               My Ans. This is a developing area in OSs where  instead of building the
               kernel as a single monolithic structure starting from scratch, it is
               built as a set of layers. The micro-kernel provides only the bare-bones
               like Device-drivers, rudimentary filesystem support etc. on which,
               depending on the intended area of application of the OS, it can be
               customized to provide various higher level OS features like
               Multiprocessing, IPC, etc. 

               Personal Questions in the second round --
               --------------------------------------

               1. Tell us about yourself, your background.
               2. What does your father do currently.
               3. Your performance in schooling, B.E.
               4. Your +/- points.
               5. Why do you think Wipro should take you.
               6. What qualities do you have that make you a person suitable for going
               into the IT industry (a corollary to the previous question).
               7. What do your friends opine about you.
               8. When do you think you will complete and be able to join.
               9. How can you assure that you will join by that time.
               10. Anything you want to know about us.

               } /* End of for() */



               Name: G.Kartik
               Year: 1995

               Company name: Wipro Infotech

                 FIRST INTERVIEW:(First the interviewer asked me to name two 
                                  favorite subjects - OS and Networks)
                 a) Describe the memory management policies in Unix. How is paging
                    implemented? How page faults are handled? 
                    Seems to be a favorite question for these chaps ---- Maurice Bach. 
                 
                 b) Write a macro in C for swapping two nibbles in a byte.
                    -Use the shift operators and be careful while defining temporary 
                    variables( if you do so) as you have to write a macro. Otherwise
                    it is pretty simple.

                 c) What is the CPU-scheduling policy in Unix? - Round robin scheduling
                    with multilevel queues.

                 d) Diffrence between short term, long term and medium term scheduler.
                    -First two should be peaceful. The last one is also known as 
                     swapper. (See Taenenbaum and/or Peterson)

                 e) Name various page-replacement policies. Which can be implemented
                    both with and without pre-emption? - see Peterson.

                 f) Describe the Sliding window protocol. What is it's advantage
                    over stop-and-wait? - Saves bandwidth. (Taenenbaum please)


                 2ND INTERVIEW (Both personal and technical interleaved)
                 a) Tell us something about yourself.
                 b) Aren't you going for higher studies abroad? Why?
                 c) Rank and CGPA. MSites do not have ranks but still they wanted to
                    know my approx position in my batch. 
                    - Shady question. It is your job to convince them that for      MS,
               grades do not hold any meaning.

                 d) What is re-entrant code? --- Non-self modifying code. Can be 
                    shared by many processes simultaneously. Gave e.g. of text-editors
                    like 'vi'.
                    Counter Q: But then no code modifies itself. What does 'non-self 
                    modifying' mean? ---- I don't know for sure.

                 e) Diff between compilers and interpreters. Some fundaes about
                    how to link code in  different files. 

                 f) What would your friends tell us about you if we ask them?
                    Standard question for everyone.



               Company: Motorola (came in August'95)
               Just one question: When do you expect to finish? ---By August'96
                                 That is too late. We are looking for guys who
                                 finish by Jan'96. Pl. apply a month before you 
                                 submit your thesis. Thank you very much. 

               Company: HCL-HP
               Written test:
               One GRE type anals. section, and two comp Sc. sections. One Comp Sc. 
               section was problem solving type. Quite easy. Only question worth
               mentioning
               in it was:
                  You are given a stack on which you can do the following:

                  Push X ----push the contents of memory location X on the stack
                  Pop X  ----pop the contents of top of stack into mem. loc X
                  AND    ----pop top two elements of stack, AND them and push the
                             result onto stack.
                  NOR    ----pop top two elements, NOR them and push the result onto
               stack.

               Given two data elements at memory locations A and B, obtain A XOR B using 
               the above.

               First Interview:- mostly technical.

                      a) Asked about my B.E. and why I joined MS.

                      b) My preference of posting. They asked this initially before
                         launching into any other questions. I told them Madras.
                         Remainder of the interview was mostly on OS and C. Nothing
                         on networks. Thus I have this inkling that they frame their 
                         questions on the basis of what you specify as your preference 
                         of posting and  depending on what projects are available there.

                      c) What architectures, apart from 8085, do you know? --- Nothing 
                         very deep and I told them as much. 
                      d) Give the contents of process stack for the execution of 
                         a particular C-program they give. 
                         ------ The C-program as such is not important. You just have 
                         to remember the order in which the return address of any 
                         function/procedure call, the parameters, and the local variables
                         are stored on the stack. 
                         ( I guess, any CO book should have this. Maurice Bach talks 
                         about user and kernel stacks)

                      e) What all are shared by parent and child processes immediately
                         after parent executes a fork system call? Cross questioned
                         about the 'copy on write' facility and 'dup' system call. 
                         --- again see MB, and also Stevens' 2nd chapter.

                      f) What events happen when the following command is given?
                              cat /etc/passwd | more 

                         ---- Describe how the shell forks the two processes and how
                              the pipe gets created between them. 
                        Cross question: How does 'cat' know that its output has to be 
                                        written into the pipe and not into standard o/p?
                                        

                      g) Have you written any TSR's? --- No.
                         What are TSR? ----Terminate but stay resident programs.
                         Then does it mean DOS is a multitasking system? 
                         ---- No, TSRs are interrupt driven

                      h) How are Windows programs different from normal C-programs?
                         ---- Windows programs are event driven.
                         What can be the various types of events? --- See Primer/API
               bible.

                      i) Difference between swapping and paging. 
                         ---- Swapping is moving entire processes between main memory
                         and hard disk. Paging is moving individual pages of a process.
                         
                      j) Write a program to list all palindromes in a string.
                         ----- Hint: use a stack and some extra storage for remembering
                         previous palindromes.

                      k) What's the outout?

                              char *cp;
                              int *ip;

                              cp=(char *)0x100;
                              ip=(int *)cp;

                              ip++;
                              cp++;
                              printf("cp = %x ip = %x", cp, ip);

                              Ans:cp = 0x101 ip = 0x102 ...(why?)

                      l) What are static variables and functions? There are two files,
                         say, file1 and file2. file1 has a global declaration
                                      static int x;
                        file2 has a global declaration
                                      int y;
                        What is the difference between the two types of declarations
                        when you link file1 and file2? 
                        --- x is local to functions in file1 and cannot be seen by  
                            functions in file2. y can be seen by functions in both 
                            file1 and file2. 
                      m) How does a debugger set breakpoints in a code you are debugging?
                         ---- some funda regarding insertion if an interrupt instruction
                              in the code....don't know for sure.
                        (It seems that this q was also asked by some other company.
                         Worth knowing the answer.)

               This was followed by a shady psychological test. You are given a 
               set of six pictures. Look at each picture and write a story on each.

               Second interview: (fully personal) --- This was more interesting;-)
                      a) What did you feel about the ppt? --- wasn't very impressive
                        so gave some shady answer.
                      b) Have you heard of creativity? -- Ya.
                         Have you heard of Bernard Shaw? -- Ya.
                         (Then he rattled off some quote of BS regarding creativity)
                         What do you say? --- I put some shadiest fundaes regarding
                         visionaries and Leonardo da Vinci conceptualising Helicopters
                         in his time!

               ************************************************************************
               NOTE: If you have been offered a job previously by any other company
                    after your BTech/BE or if you have even slightest of work experience
                    then make it a point to mention about it.  It is a major plus point.
                    The interviewers will be definitely interested in knowing that some 
                    other company also found you good enough to be selected.

               This is a very good question bank for written test of some software 
               companies.
               This can be passed freely to anyone. No restrictions of Class, Branch,
               Institute , bla bla ...

               Optimize the below 1,2,3,4 questions for time:

               1)
               int i;
               if i=0 then i:=1;
               if i=1 then i:=0;

               2)
               int i;
               if i=0 then i:=1;
               if i=1 then i:=0;
               (given that i can take only two values (1,0))

               3)
               int i;
               if i=0 then i:=1;
               else if i=1 then i:=0;
               (given that i can take only two values (1,0))

               4)
               int m,j,i,n;
               for i:=1 to n do
               m:=m+j*n

               5) Expand the following

               c) CSMA/CD
               d) OOPS
               e) MIMD

               6) In the following questions, answer A,B,C,D depending on when 
               the errors are  detected?
                A if no error is detected
                B if semantic and syntactic checking
                C if during Code genration & Symbol allocation
                D run time

               a) Array overbound
               b) Undeclared identifier
               c) stack underflow
               d) Accessing an illegal memory location

               7) How many page faults will occur for below sequence of pages when LRU
               page replacement algorithm is used ( The memory can only have 3pages):

               1,2,3,4,2,1,5,2,4 (something like that) 



               8) If a CPU has 20 address lines but MMU does'nt use two of them.
                 OS occupies 20K. No virtual memory is supported. What is the 
                 maximum memory available for a user program?

               9) For a binary tree with n nodes, How many nodes are there which
                has got both a parent and a child?

               10) Understand the funda of incrementing a variable using 
                  val++   and ++val . Some programs are given for error correction.

               11) Learn datagram . (Computer networks)

               12) Which of the following can be zero? (only one)
                  a)  swap space
                  b)  physical memory    c)  virtual memory 

               13) What is a must for multitasking?
                  a) Process preemption
                  b) Paging
                  c) Virtual memory    d) None of the above

               14) A question on call by value,
                                call by name,
                                call by reference.

               f(x,y,z)
               {
               y := y+1;
               z := z+x;
               }
               main() {
               int a,b;
               a := 2
               b := 2;
               f(a+b,a,a);
               print a;
               }

               what is the value of a printed for three different calls in main.

                 POP  <reg>
                 NOR    These instructions operates with A & B and puts the result in
                 AND     A

               (question basically to get XOR in terms of NOR and AND)

               16) True/False questions:
                 1) The page size should be the power of 2.

               int j=0;

               loop: 
                if(i = 0)
                   i++;
                i++;
                j++;
                if(j<= 25)
                  goto loop
               xxx:   


               question1 : how many times is the loop entered 
               A few questions of that sort. some count fundaes. Easy one )

               18)  Who handles page faults? 
                a) OS
                b) MMU
                c) Hardware logic
                d) etc etc....

               19)  For which of following is it not possible to write an algorithm.

               a) To find out 1026th prime number
               b) To write program for NP-complete problem
               c) To write program which generates true Random numbers.
               etc...

               20) what is the essential requirement for an real-time systems

               a) pre-emption
               b) virtual memory c) paging  etc...
