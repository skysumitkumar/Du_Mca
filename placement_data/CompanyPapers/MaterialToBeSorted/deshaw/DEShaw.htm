<p><font size="3">In July 1988, a small investment partnership called
D.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;Shaw&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Co.,&nbsp;L.P. was organized with an <strong>initial
capitalization of US $28 million</strong> and an ambitious plan for the application of
quantitative and computational techniques to various aspects of the securities business.
Today, the D.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;Shaw group of companies has approximately $1.2 billion in
aggregate capital, and has earned an international reputation for financial innovation and
technological leadership. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">For the first several years of its existence,
D.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;&nbsp;Shaw&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Co. used its technical expertise solely to
trade for its own account, establishing a quiet reputation within the quantitative
financial community while remaining nearly invisible to the world at large. In 1992,
however, the firm made a strategic decision to expand its focus and presence, launching a
new business unit to apply quantitative and computational techniques in support of the
provision of financial services to outside customers. A third line of activity was added
in 1994, when the<strong> company began to fund (and, in some cases, organize) early- and
intermediate-stage technology-oriented business ventures.</strong></font></p>

<p>The firm was <strong>founded in 1988 by David&nbsp;E.&nbsp;Shaw</strong>, who continues
to serve as chairman and chief executive officer of D.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;Shaw &amp;
Co.,&nbsp;Inc. The author of 63 scholarly publications, Dr. Shaw received his Ph.D. from
Stanford University in 1980 and served on the faculty of the Department of Computer
Science at Columbia University before joining Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. in 1986 as its vice
president in charge of automated analytical trading technology. Earlier, he founded and
served as president and CEO of Stanford Systems Corporation, a computer systems firm based
in California's Silicon Valley.</p>

<p>The indian arm of the company is <strong>based in Hyderabad</strong>. The company's pay
package is comparable to the best in the industry.</p>
