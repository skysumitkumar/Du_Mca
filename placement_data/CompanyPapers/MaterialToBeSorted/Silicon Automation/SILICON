	This mail gives an idea of the kind of work that Silicon Automation
 Systems is into.This is particularly of concern to the people who would be
 facing Campus Interviews in near future.You may ignore the following if it
 does not concern you.
 For any further correspondence, you may contact

>  At SAS we have the following areas:
> -------------------------------------- 
>  *Networking
>  *Wireless
>  *Electronic Design Automation
>  *Embedded systems tools
>  *Multimedia
>  *Digital Signal Processing
>  *Hardware design and modelling
>  
> A short write up on the groups is given below.
> 
> *The Networking group of SAS is involved in almost all of
> the key areas in networking. The areas are Network Planning,
> Protocol development, Network management, Client-server applications
> and Computer telephony integration. The projects currently
> in progress are Paging data distribution network,
> Voice over Ethernet with Gateway functions to the PSTN,
> FAX-modem protocol developement and image compression, Licensing
> server and value added feature development for a network planning tool.
> The group is soon going to commence new projects related to
> ATM networks and IPv6. Network management and ADSL are the areas
> identified for diversification by the end of this year.
>   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
> 
> *The (Hardware)Board Design Group is into the design of state-of-the-art 
> Hardware. The activities include designing with latest Microprocessors,
> Digital Signal Processors (DSPs), FPGAs, PLDs and other complex
> communication devices in addition to a host of peripherals and analog 
> interface
> circuits.  The group is involved in the design of boards in the areas
> like
> Multimedia, Digital Signal Processing, Networking, Cellular and other
> telecommunication fields.
>  
> *Activities in Wireless Networks group:
> ---------------------------------------
> Nature of activities:
> ====================
> 
> 1. Feature development based on standards
>    (Involves DSP algorithms & assmbly programming also)
> 2. Tools development
> 3. Protocol modelling
> 4. Performance evaluation
> 5. Field support activities
> 
> Note: Activity like field support is not done in isolation. One has
>       to work on DRU product before it can be done.
> 
> 
> Standards used for above activities:
> ===================================
> 
> 1. AMPS/TDMA - IS54B, IS136, IS88, IS91A
> 2. CDPD spec 1.x
> 3. CDMA      - IS95
> 4. New Std   - IS661
> 
> ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
> *The Embedded Systems Tools group's mandate is to cater to all tools
> --------------------------------
> needed for Software Development on new Embedded Processors.
> 
> * Currently the scope includes: (1) Development of cycle-accurate
>   software models of the processors (2) Re-targetting of GNU's
>   C-Compiler, Assembler, Linker etc for them and (3) R&D work on
>   re-configurable micro-kernels. The group has particular focus on
>   Tool-Generating Programs to cater to the urgency for such tools
>   for every new processor.
> 
> * The in-house R&D activity includes Software Processor-Model Generators
>   and code-generation/optimisation issues for Digital Signal Processors
>   and VLIW architectures.
> 
> * In anticipation of future activities planned, we are also interested
>   in people having a strong expertise/interest in (i) Algoritms (focus
>   on Scheduling and Resource Allocation), (ii) modern processor
>   architectures and (iii) software interfaces to peripherals and
>   boot-strapping for OSs.
> 
> ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
> *The Multimedia Technology Group in SAS is involved in developing audio
> -------------------------------
> video codecs based on MPEG, Dolby AC3 and H.26x standards for  various
> RISC, DSP, VLIW, Super Scalar and Data Flow processors.  The group is
> also involved in active research in the area of low bitrate coding,
> model based coding, error resilient coding, psychoacoustics and 3D
> acoustic space modelling along with institutes like IITs and IISc.
> The group is developing its own products for DVD, VideoCD and Video
> Conferencing applications and is exploring future applications in
> interactive and distributed Multimedia and opportunities in Multimedia
> ASIC design.  The work content within the group spans embedded DSP
> solutions, Distributed Multimedia architectures, Multimedia
> communications and Internet programming, and, in the near future, will
> also include hardware architecture design.
>  
> -------------------------------------------------------------------------
> *DSP Group
> =========
> 
> The group works in the area of design and implementation of digital
> communications and speech processing systems.  In digital
> communications the group is currently working on design of modems
> working over twisted pair copper lines and physical layer software for
> cellular systems.  In speech processing the group is involved in the
> implementation of speech codecs and development of new codecs.
> 
> -------------------------------------------------------------------------
> *  Electronic Design Automation (EDA) Group at SAS
>    -----------------------------------------------
> 
> This is the oldest group at SAS. SAS started its operations with EDA in 
> 1989.
> The activities of the group involve developing CAD tools for VLSI 
> designers.
> Over the years we have developed tremendous expertise in various domains
> of
> EDA. We have primarliy been developing tools concerning: Hardware 
> Description
> Language (HDL) compilers, Simulation, Synthesis and Physical Design 
> Automation.
> 
> The expertise required to develop these tools includes sound computer 
> science
> background with emphasis on Algorithms, Data Structures, Compilers and
> Programming. In addition some knowledge of digital design is helpful.
> 
> ---------------------------------------------------------------------
> Clients include Fujitsu, Philips, Cirkisys, Toshiba, Sharp,Oki, 
> Shinko, Nortel.
> 
> We are a 100 %  export oriented company developing state of the art 
> Technology for global markets.
> 
> Salaries for campus for the year 1997-98 is:
> 
>         BTech-----Rs.1,60,000/-gross per annum
>         Mtech-----Rs.2,00,000/-gross per annum
>         PhD------depending on the person! 
> 
> We have NO BOnds.. The only ones we beleive in are trust bonds.
> 
> Our office is situated in Bangalore. We have no branches.

> We have a team of 253 people today with the Technical team numbering
> 205.
> People at SAS are from various premier institutes. From IITB itself we 
> have atleast 30 + people. 
> 
> All groups have their specific domain in which they excel. There is 
> combination of all 3 Development, documentation and debugging work in
> each 
> field.There is No "OR" in this, everything is " and".
> Each area we work in is a specialised field and we have expertise 
> comparable to the best in the world.
