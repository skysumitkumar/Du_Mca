<br>
TCS Test Pattern:<br>
It was an online exam…. Test Consists of 3 Sections…<br>
1.	Test on Synonyms and Antonyms (40 questions, 20 minutes: Also Q’s on Sentence Completion).<br>
2.	Aptitude Test (32 questions, 40 minutes: General Questions on Mathematics).<br>
3.	Critical Reasoning (30 Minutes: 3 Analysis Paragraphs and 12 questions Relating them).<br>
4.	Psychometric Test (150 Questions, 30 minutes: only if you Qualify in the above tests).<br>
<br>
Details about How to Prepare for the above tests:<br>
<br>
1.	    Verbal Ability:<br>
<br>
                           This Test contains Synonyms &amp; Antonyms…Almost all of them were From GRE&nbsp;<br>
                           BARRON’S 12th Edition &amp; upward…30-50% of them will be repeated from previous&nbsp;<br>
                           TCS papers. Few Questions on Sentence Completion were also there..for these also refer&nbsp;<br>
                           BARRON’S<br>
<br>
                           NOTE:<br>
                                During the Exam you should be careful because on the computer screen the names&nbsp;<br>
                                Synonyms &amp; Antonyms will be placed side by side so that we may by mistake choose&nbsp;<br>
                                an antonym instead of a synonym…so Be Careful..<br>
<br>
2.	    Aptitude Test:<br>
<br>
                         This test will consist of very general questions…This is the easiest section Compared to the&nbsp;<br>
                         Other two. Almost 70-80 Questions will be repeated from the Previous TCS Papers…just&nbsp;<br>
                         learn the method from those papers same model will be given..(This happen almost all&nbsp;<br>
                         the times). If you have time refer to any Aptitude book of your interest…it may be&nbsp;<br>
                         R.S.AGARWAL or any Other……<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
3.	   Critical Reasoning:<br>
<br>
    Here Starts your Problems…30 Minutes…12 questions..don’t think that there is a lot of&nbsp;<br>
    Time..these will be somewhat tougher those who has some touch with such kind..and will&nbsp;<br>
    be Very Tough.. if you haven’t seen this kind before..so,you should have some practice&nbsp;<br>
    relating this kind of questions…<br>
<br>
                          3 paragraphs will be given.. 3X4.. 12 questions.. first 2 paragraphs will be&nbsp;<br>
    some twisty questions… like our arrangements questions… routes between cities.. like&nbsp;<br>
    that… and the last one will be on Data Interpretation…<br>
<br>
                    you prepare Data Interpretation again from BARRON’S…. but the remaining&nbsp;<br>
    from R.S.AGARWAL-Reasoning…. Or from Barron’s 13th Edition<br>
<br>
4.	   Psychometric Test:<br>
                      This test comes up only if you qualify in the Aptitude test… This test consists of 150&nbsp;<br>
                         questions which we should answer in 30 minutes (of course, that much time is not required)<br>
                         Don’t think that this test has no weightage.. there is filtering in this test too… this test tests&nbsp;<br>
                         your psychology.. Remember among 150 many questions were asked again &amp; again in a&nbsp;<br>
                         variety of ways.. so don’t get trapped… be honest while attempting this test.. choose what&nbsp;<br>
                         you’re your heart says.. it will take you through the test..<br>
<br>
                                      This ends the Tests……<br>
<br>
INTERVIEWS:<br>
<br>
             Now if you are Alive Even after All these tests….then you have to face a Technical Interview…<br>
             It may be on the same day of the Test.. so be Prepared in Advance…..<br>
             The Interview will be done by a Panel of 2 members…. No need to worry.. They will be Very&nbsp;<br>
             supporting &amp; Friendly.. First they ask us to Introduce ourselves… then they’ll go into your project<br>
             details… don’t forget to prepare project…. They mainly concentrate on your project only…so be&nbsp;<br>
             confident on every aspect of your project… then you should have some basic knowledge on C&nbsp;<br>
             language. There will be some questions like “what is the o/p of this code?”, “what are the errors in&nbsp;<br>
             the code?”..like that… so be prepared for all the basic concepts.. If needed you have to write some&nbsp;<br>
             small codes too.. at the end they will ask some general questios like “Why TCS?”, “Where do you&nbsp;<br>
             see yourself in the next five years?”, “do you have any questions?”, try ask some questions… it&nbsp;<br>
             shows your interest in the Company..<br>
<br>
           HR:<br>
<br>
            Now if Chase this one too…. Then comes your Final Attack.. the HR Round… I many times heard&nbsp;<br>
            that “I failed in HR round!”..  likewise anwers…. But you should not fail in it.. because it involves&nbsp;<br>
            no technical questions… it just dwell into your innerself… so, be confident and frank while facing&nbsp;<br>
            this round…They generally ask questions like “Tell about yourself?”, “Who r your role models?”,&nbsp;<br>
            “What is your weakness?”, don’t say “I Have no weakness!”, just prepare a small weakness for&nbsp;<br>
           yourself that causes no harm to your future…O.K.. “What is your mother tongue?”<br>
<br>
                               if your Academic background is good.. be prepared to face some Techies here too….<br>
<br>
           NOW IF YOU ARE SUCCESSFUL HERE TOO….. CONGRATS… YOU ARE IN TCS…..<br>
