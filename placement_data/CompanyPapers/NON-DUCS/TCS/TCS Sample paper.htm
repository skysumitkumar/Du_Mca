<P><FONT color=#000000 size=3>The test is followed by a Technical and a HR 
interview.The technical interview is highly specialised and covers almost all 
subjects you have done in your curriculum. However one is required to name 
his/her favorite subject on which most of the interview is focussed. For 
Computer Engineers C, Operating Systems, DBMS, Microprocessors are mostly 
focussed upon. Electronics Engineers can be grilled on DCLD, Microprocessors and 
Communications.For details on the frequently asked questions please refer to our

section</A><FONT color=#000000 size=3>.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000000 size=3>The HR interview which follows the technical 
interview is very general. The Hr interview is also important. Mostly questions 
are asked to test your temperament. You maybe asked your opinion on a variety of 
current affair topics. We were asked about Homosexuality, Lesbianism(the movie 
FIRE), Kashmir, Genome Project etc. In some cases questions regarding the 
company are asked. For details on the other frequently asked questions please 
refer to our <A href="http://placementpapers.com/Intsec.htm">Interview

in 1968.<STRONG> Mr.F.C Kohli</STRONG> who is presently the <STRONG>Deputy 
Chairman</STRONG> was entrusted with the job of steering TCS. The early days 
marked TCS resonsibility in managing the punch card operations of Tisco. The 
company, which was into management consultancy from day one, soon felt the need 
to provide solutions to its clients as well.TCS was the first Indian company to 
make forays into the US market with clients ranging from <STRONG>IBM</STRONG>, 
<STRONG>American Express, Sega </STRONG>etc. TCS is presently the top software 
services firm in Asia.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000000 size=3>During the <STRONG>Y2K</STRONG> buildup, TCS had 
setup a Y2K<STRONG> </STRONG>factory in Chennai as a short-term strategy. Now, 
with <STRONG>E-business</STRONG> being the buzzword, the factory is developing 
solutions for the dotcom industries. Today, about 90 percent of TCS' revenue 
comes from <STRONG>consulting</STRONG>, while the rest from 
<STRONG>products</STRONG>. TCS has great training facilities. In addition to 
training around 5 percent of the revenue is spent upon its R&amp;D centres like 
the Tata Research Design and Development Centre at Pune, along with a host of 
other centres at Mumbai and Hyderabad.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000000 size=3>It benchmarked its quality standing, invested 
heavily in software engineering practices and built intellectual property-in 
terms of <STRONG>patents,code </STRONG>and<STRONG> branded products.</STRONG> At 
the same time, it expanded its relationships with technology partners and 
organisations, increased <STRONG>linkages with academic institutions</STRONG> 
and incubated technologies and ideas of people within TCS and outside. TCS has 
already <STRONG>patented 12 E-Commerce</STRONG> solution product packages and 
has filed <STRONG>six more applications</STRONG> for patent licences.</FONT></P>
