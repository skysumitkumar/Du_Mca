<P align=justify><FONT color=#000000 size=2>Tata Consultancy Services conducts a 
multiple choice test. The test consists of four sections. The first section is 
the Verbal Section with 15 questions to be attempted in 6 minutes. The questions 
deal with words and their synonyms. You need a high level of vocabulary to do 
well in this part. The second section is a Quantitive aptitude section with 15 
questions to be answered in 10 minutes. The questions deal with basic 
mathematics such as multiplication, percentages etc. This is the easiest among 
all the sections (try not to make silly mistakes). The third section is the 
Reading Comprehension section with 50 minutes to answer 60 questions. The fourth 
section is a 30 minutes Psychometric Test with 150 questions. These questions 
are generally simple personality based questions checking your ability to answer 
consistently. Usually only a Yes/No type answer is required for these 
questions.</FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT color=#000000 size=2>The test is followed by a Technical 
and a HR interview. The technical interview is highly specialized and covers 
almost all subjects you have done in your curriculum. However one is required to 
name his/her favorite subject on which most of the interview is focused. For 
Computer Engineers C, Operating Systems, DBMS, Microprocessors are mostly 
focused upon. Electronics Engineers can be grilled on DCLD, Microprocessors and 
Communications..</P>
<P align=justify>The HR interview which follows the technical interview is very 
general. The Hr interview is also important. Mostly questions are asked to test 
your temperament. You maybe asked your opinion on a variety of current affair 
topics. We were asked about Homosexuality, Lesbianism (the movie FIRE), Kashmir, 
Genome Project etc. In some cases questions regarding the company are 
asked.</FONT> </P>
