				CTS (PSG TECH)<br>
  <br>
  There are totally 5 sections in the qp and each section has 8 questions.&nbsp;<br>
  NO. of questions = 40<br>
  Time = 60 min<br>
  Negative marking = 0.25 for each wrong answer<br>
  <br>
  SECTION 1(try this at last because it is very tough and time consuming)<br>
  L1, L2 - lists<br>
  M(L1,L2) = L1 + L2<br>
  If , L = (a,b,c)<br>
  A(L) = a (first term); B(L) = (b,c) (except the first term)<br>
  <br>
  I]  P(L) = L if L=( ), &amp; B(L)=()<br>
    P(L) = A(B(L)) if L &lt;> ( ), and B(L)&lt;>( ) B(B(L))=( )<br>
    P(L) = M(A(L)), M(A(B(L)), P(B(B(L))) if B(B(L) &lt;>C)<br>
  <br>
  II]  R(L) = L   :  B(L)=( )<br>
     R(L) = A(L) if L&lt;>()<br>
     R(L) = M(dont know), R(B(B(L)))if B(B(L)) &lt;>( )<br>
  <br>
  With the above instructions, find the following using iterations:<br>
  1.  R(P(L)) where L=(a,b,(a,b),(b,a))<br>
  2.  R(P(L)) where L=(a,(a),(b,b),b)<br>
  <br>
  Example(1)P(L)=P(a,b,(a,b),(b,a))<br>
  where A(L)=(a)<br>
      B(L)=(b,(a,b),(b,a))<br>
      B(B(L))=((a,b),(b,a))<br>
  So, third condition is applicable<br>
  So, P(L)=M(a,M(b,P((a,b),(b,a))) find this using the same rule and iterate.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  SECTION 2<br>
  Question and Answers don't know&nbsp;<br>
	If GODG is a valid work, then the no. of valid words in the string (GGODGG,<br>
  GGOGGD, GGOGDGGG, ....)<br>
  (* Not aware of correct procedure)<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  SECTION 3<br>
  <br>
	A 'TARGET' is a number and 'BRICK' has five numbers as clue.  Use only four<br>
  numbers (only once each number) from 'BRICK' using arithmetic opertions,<br>
  +,-,*,/,() and attain the 'TARGET'<br>
  1.  TARGET = 114    BRICK =<br>
  2.  TARGET = 19     BRICK = 8,11,5,5,2<br>
  3.  TARGET = 87     BRICK =&nbsp;<br>
  4.  TARGET = 146    BRICK =&nbsp;<br>
  5.  TARGET= 127     BRICK =&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  Ans: for 2 questions&nbsp;<br>
      19 = (8+11-5+5)<br>
      so ans = (8,11,5,5)<br>
  <br>
  SECTION 4<br>
