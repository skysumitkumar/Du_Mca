Regarding Interview:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

you should say everything confidently, whatever you say tell them frankly and confidently i.e. I will do this, I will definetely learn within this period, now I am learning etc. regarding C-language, COBOL, etc. They will ask, 
Q) How can you be best suited to our TCS (or Soft ware field)? 
Ans: Some of my seniors told that TCS is doing consultancy business in soft-ware field, this requires some sort of programming skills, knowledge of programming languages, in addition to this it requires a sort of aptitude skill which I am sure of possing it, this I can say based on my past academic ahcievements. Also now I am learning C, I learned up to .... 
(say arrays or functions) I will go through Pointers etc. also I am learning COBOL, I am preparing for TCS C, COBOL test. 

Question) Why are you shifting from your ............ field to software field? 
Ans: I am interested in soft-ware field, because of its bright & prosperous 
future and quick recogniton of talent leading to faster growth. 

They will ask about your family members and you, you just simply answer the truth frankly, they donot bouther about your father occupation i.e business studies, etc. 

Question:) how can you compete with a computer background student as you are a pure ---- Engg student? 
Ans: Actually I have taken Fortran/C/C++ as one of my courses in B.Tech/Minor Area. course, now here in IIT I learned --------- languages( something about what you learned in IITD), initially I found slightly difficulty to compete with a student having computers background, but now I am confident of learning programming skills as once I am in the process of learning I am sure of achieving this. 
here we have first talked about family, then about 4 minutes talk on my project then they questioned on the project, then they asked about soft-ware i.e do you know about INTERNET, Y2K problem, etc. I frankly told that I donot know 
about INTERNET, I know a little bit about Y2K problem and explained about Y2K problem i.e now in all computers year is indicated by two digits only, finally after the 99th year (1999) the computer will treat as 00 year(1900) 
instead of considering it as 2000. meanwhile one or two question on my academic record, about my refrigeration companies, etc. if you have a good topic on your project, you tell about that one and have a little knowledge on it so you can answer well their questions.
