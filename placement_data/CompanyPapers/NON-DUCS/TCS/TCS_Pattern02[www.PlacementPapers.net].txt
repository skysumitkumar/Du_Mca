i am fresher like you people..waiting to be placed..

i joined this group 20 days back.. i appreciate the job being done..

now coming to the .. query.. about tcs.. interview, i congratulate 

all those who got through their new test pattern.. 


tips to face tcs.. interview..(IT) questions are as follows..

note:important..

their strategy is stress interview..

they delibrately humiliate you.. ask disintresting questions to put 
you under pressure.. i am not exaggerating.. its true...

please be prepared to face questions from any subject that is 
there in your curriculm.. even accounts and other subjects that are 
there in your curriculm.. specially tcs people  will ask you your 
area of intrest..

then they start asking questions from subjects.. other than the one 
you mentioned as your area of intrest..

their argument is that you should be able to answer anything from 
your first year first sem to last year last sem..
