  Researchers in Mumbai have found that certain types of gallstones can be
  dissolved by injecting them with a gasoline additive in the form of ether. The
  ether is injected through a tube directly into the gall bladder. The one-day
  treatment works only on cholesterol-based stones, not those composed largely
  of calcium. However, as the cholesterol stones are by far the most common
  type, for millions of gallstone sufferers the treatment should offer a welcome
  alternative to surgery, the commonest option in most hospitals.<br>
  <b># </b>&quot;It takes more than one day for ether to dissolve a
  calcium-based gallstone&quot;.<br>
  <b>#</b> &quot;Gallstones can only be dissolved by injections&quot;.<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Human
  existence is not susceptible of arbitrary division between consciousness and
  unconsciousness. The conscious world invaders and shapes the activities of the
  unconscious, while many of the great achievements of humanity's waking hours
  where wholly or partly inspired by dreams. Even if it could argued that dreams
  precede experience such a dichotomy could not be drawn, as the influence of
  the dreaming on the waking state would remain unclear, but as yet no common
  vocabulary exists to record the substance of prenatal dreaming.<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hacking is a crime made possible by a relatively new technology, which is one
  of the reasons it is often poorly understood and reported. Many computers, but
  by no means all, are now linked together in networks which allow users on one
  computer to communicate with others on the same network. If a computer is not
  networked, no manipulation of its data from another machine possible. So long
  as users are authorized, networking is just a way of making work easier more
  productive. Hacking, on the other hand is the unauthorized use of networks or
  unauthorized entry into the computers themselves. Most people do not break
  into the networks they use, since they are already accredited users.<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Polycythemia often occurs in people who have chronic lung disease, but can
  appear spontaneously in healthy individuals. Excessive numbers of red blood
  cells manufactured by the body and the individual then develops a very
  healthy-looking, ruddy complexion. The blood becomes thicker and is liable to
  clot and block major blood vessels. High blood pressure is another frequent
  complication. Treatment involves venesection, in which a liter or so of blood
  is removed from the body. Medication may also be given to reduce the numbers
  of red blood cells manufactured in the body.<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bindweed is only effectively controlled by applying a solution of

  the the leaders can be laid out on the the ground , they can easily be wetted
  with a small brush. As long as the weather is calm, there is no real risk of
  damage to adjacent plants, and in two or three weeks the weeds should have

  crossed over to Wisconsin river and followed it to the upper Mississippi. The
  party then descended the Mississippi to the mouth of Arkansas. These Frenchmen

  Moscoso had done so a century and a half before. The report of the exploration

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Goddard was the first to fire a rocket that reached a speed faster than
  the speed of sound. He was the first to develop a gyroscopic steering
  apparatus for rockets. He was the first to use vanes in the jet stream for
  rocket stabilization during the initial phase of a rocket flight. And he was
  the first to patent the idea of step rockets. After proving on paper and in
  actual tests that a rocket can travel in vacuum, he developed the mathematical
  theory of rocket propulsion and rocket flight, including basic designs for
  long-range rockets. All of this information was available to our military men
  before World War II, but evidently its immediate use didn't seem applicable.
  Near the end of World War II we started intense work on rocket-powered guided

  Landing briefly at San Salvador, Bahamas, he wound through unchartered islands
  until he sighted an extensive coastline. He had no reason to suspect that it
  is anything more than an island, but he followed the coast for a day without
  rounding its end or finding a suitable landing place. He named the
  &quot;island&quot; La Florida. This name came to be applied by the Spanish to
  the entire Southeastern United States and beyond. Then, near the 30th
  parallel, de Leon landed at the mouth of the St. Johns river. Determined to be
  the first to circumnavigate the &quot;island&quot;, he turned south, traced
  the coast around the tip of the peninsula, moved to the west, perhaps reaching
  Tampa bay. After 7 weeks, he gave up hope of circling the northern tip of this

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; James Madison understood that interests groups will inevitably develop within
  a free political system. The problem, as Madison saw it, was to prevent any
  single interest group from becoming so strong that it was able to dominate the
  political system. This could be accomplished by legislating restrictions on
  political behavior, but that solution meant a sacrifice of some of the freedom
  that Madison prized so highly. A better solution, he thought, was to extend
  the territorial scope of the government. This would allow for greater
  diversity of interests in the nation, and a greater number of groups competing
  for power. Each interest group would thereby find it more difficult to appeal
  to a majority of the people, and to dominate the political process.<br>

  The regulations and expenses to invent, patent and market new ideas and
  products imposes a heavy burden on inventors. The cost is often absorbed by
  large corporations with research and development facilities they provide.
  Corporations also help creative people contribute to society without suffering
  the loss of income or security of the private inventor. The realities of this
  arrangement are that many good ideas are never brought into the marketplace
  and the cost of products on the market is high because of the development
  cost. However, protection provided by the patents and the safety to the public
  to avoid placing harmful products on the market is important to maintain.
  Thus, as is often the case, rules and regulations have their favorable and

  Being born female and black were two handicaps Gwendolyn Brooks states that
  she faced from her birth, in 1917, in Kansas. Brooks was determined to
  succeed. Despite the lack of encouragement she received from her teachers and
  others, she was determined to write and found the first publisher for one of
  her poems when she was 11. In 1945, she marketed and sold her first book;
  national recognition ensued. She applied for and received grants and
  fellowships from such organizations as the AAAL and the Guggenheim Foundation.
  Later she received the Pulitzer prize for poetry; she was the first black
  woman to receive such an honor. Brooks' reaction to fame is atypical. She
  continues to work and work hard. She writes, travels, and helps many who are
  interested in writing. Especially important for her is increasing her

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cave is a natural opening in the ground extending beyond the zone of light
  and large enough to permit the entry of man. Occurring in a wide variety of
  rock types and caused by widely differing geological processes, caves range in
  size from single small rooms to interconnecting passages many miles long. The
  scientific study of caves is called speleology. It is a composite science
  based on geology, hydrology, biology and archeology, and thus holds special

  prehistoric times. Prolific evidence of early man's interest has been
  discovered in caves scattered throughout the world. Skeletons of some of the

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Life in colonial times was harsh, and the refinements of the mother country
  were ordinarily lacking. The colonists, however, soon began to mold their
  English culture into the fresh environment of new land. The influence of
  religion permeated the entire way of life. In most Southern colonies, the
  Anglican church was the legally established church. In New England, the
  Puritans were dominant; and in Pennsylvania, the Quakers. Especially in the
  New England colonies, the local or village church was the hub of community
  life; the authorities strictly enforced the Sabbath and sometimes banished
  non-believers. Unfortunately, the same sort of religious intolerance, bigotry
  and superstition associated with the age of Reformation in Europe also
  prevailed in some of the colonies, though on a lesser scale. In the last half
  of the 17th century, during sporadic outbreak of religious fanaticism and
  hysteria, Connecticut authorities tried and hanged several women as
  &quot;witches&quot;. Early in the 17th century, some other witchcraft
  persecution occurred in Virginia. As the decades passed, however, religious
