Researchers in Mumbai have found that certain types of gallstones can be

ether is injected through a tube directly into the gall bladder. The one-day 
treatment works only on cholesterol-based stones, not those composed largely of 
calcium. However, as the cholesterol stones are by far the most common type, for 
millions of gallstone sufferers the treatment should offer a welcome alternative

Hacking is a crime made possible by a relatively new technology, which is one of 
the reasons it is often poorly understood and reported. Many computers, but by 
no means all, are now linked together in networks which allow users on one 
computer to communicate with others on the same network. If a computer is not 
networked, no manipulation of its data from another machine possible. So long as 
users are authorized, networking is just a way of making work easier more 
productive. Hacking, on the other hand is the unauthorized use of networks or 
unauthorized entry into the computers themselves. Most people do not break into 
the networks they use, since they are already accredited users.<BR><BR><B>#</B>

Polycythemia often occurs in people who have chronic lung disease, but can 
appear spontaneously in healthy individuals. Excessive numbers of red blood 
cells manufactured by the body and the individual then develops a very 
healthy-looking, ruddy complexion. The blood becomes thicker and is liable to 
clot and block major blood vessels. High blood pressure is another frequent 
complication. Treatment involves venesection, in which a liter or so of blood is

Bindweed is only effectively controlled by applying a solution of

length from the host plant before treatment, but this is not so very difficult, 
and it does not seem essential to find and treat every leader on the same weed.

other, in a rubber glove, inserts the leaders in the can. If the the leaders can 
be laid out on the the ground , they can easily be wetted with a small brush. As 
long as the weather is calm, there is no real risk of damage to adjacent plants,

Pierre Claude Jean Allouez explored lake superior from 1665 to 1667. At his 
little mission station near the western end of the lake, he heard from the 
Indians of a great river to the west. Pierre Jacques Marquette determined to 
investigate. In 1673, accompanied by Louis Jolliet and five others, he left St. 
Ignace mission and ascended the fox river, which flows into green bay crossed 
over to Wisconsin river and followed it to the upper Mississippi. The party then 
descended the Mississippi to the mouth of Arkansas. These Frenchmen were not 
first Europeans to sight or travel the Mississippi. De Soto and Moscoso had done 
so a century and a half before. The report of the exploration was rushed back to 
Quebec, where, in 1672, Count Frontenac had arrived as Governor of the province. 
He and his friend, the remarkable La Salle-who earlier may have penetrated the 
Ohio river valley-listened with deep interest. <BR><BR><B>#</B> "Allouez

Dr. Goddard was the first to fire a rocket that reached a speed faster than the 
speed of sound. He was the first to develop a gyroscopic steering apparatus for 
rockets. He was the first to use vanes in the jet stream for rocket 
stabilization during the initial phase of a rocket flight. And he was the first 
to patent the idea of step rockets. After proving on paper and in actual tests 
that a rocket can travel in vacuum, he developed the mathematical theory of 
rocket propulsion and rocket flight, including basic designs for long-range 
rockets. All of this information was available to our military men before World 
War II, but evidently its immediate use didn't seem applicable. Near the end of 
World War II we started intense work on rocket-powered guided missiles, using

In March 1513, de Leon sailed off confidently from Peuto Rico for the Bahamas. 
Landing briefly at San Salvador, Bahamas, he wound through unchartered islands 
until he sighted an extensive coastline. He had no reason to suspect that it is 
anything more than an island, but he followed the coast for a day without 
rounding its end or finding a suitable landing place. He named the "island" La 
Florida. This name came to be applied by the Spanish to the entire Southeastern 
United States and beyond. Then, near the 30th parallel, de Leon landed at the 
mouth of the St. Johns river. Determined to be the first to circumnavigate the 
"island", he turned south, traced the coast around the tip of the peninsula, 
moved to the west, perhaps reaching Tampa bay. After 7 weeks, he gave up hope of 
circling the northern tip of this "island"; it was incredibly large and he may 
have suspected that he had discovered the long sought mainland. If so, it all 
belonged to his King, for he had earlier planted the Spanish flag and claimed 
Florida for Ferdinand. <BR><BR><B>#</B> "de Leon is from Spain, ruled by

James Madison understood that interests groups will inevitably develop within a 
free political system. The problem, as Madison saw it, was to prevent any single 
interest group from becoming so strong that it was able to dominate the 
political system. This could be accomplished by legislating restrictions on 
political behavior, but that solution meant a sacrifice of some of the freedom 
that Madison prized so highly. A better solution, he thought, was to extend the 
territorial scope of the government. This would allow for greater diversity of 
interests in the nation, and a greater number of groups competing for power. 
Each interest group would thereby find it more difficult to appeal to a majority 
of the people, and to dominate the political process. <BR><BR><B>#</B> "The more

The regulations and expenses to invent, patent and market new ideas and products 
imposes a heavy burden on inventors. The cost is often absorbed by large 
corporations with research and development facilities they provide. Corporations 
also help creative people contribute to society without suffering the loss of 
income or security of the private inventor. The realities of this arrangement 
are that many good ideas are never brought into the marketplace and the cost of 
products on the market is high because of the development cost. However, 
protection provided by the patents and the safety to the public to avoid placing 
harmful products on the market is important to maintain. Thus, as is often the 
case, rules and regulations have their favorable and unfavorable consequences.

Being born female and black were two handicaps Gwendolyn Brooks states that she 
faced from her birth, in 1917, in Kansas. Brooks was determined to succeed. 
Despite the lack of encouragement she received from her teachers and others, she 
was determined to write and found the first publisher for one of her poems when 
she was 11. In 1945, she marketed and sold her first book; national recognition 
ensued. She applied for and received grants and fellowships from such 
organizations as the AAAL and the Guggenheim Foundation. Later she received the 
Pulitzer prize for poetry; she was the first black woman to receive such an 
honor. Brooks' reaction to fame is atypical. She continues to work and work 
hard. She writes, travels, and helps many who are interested in writing. 
Especially important for her is increasing her knowledge of her black heritage 
and encouraging other people to do the same. She encourages dedication to the 
art to would-be writers. <BR><BR><B>#</B> "Brooks' story illustrates the power

A cave is a natural opening in the ground extending beyond the zone of light and 
large enough to permit the entry of man. Occurring in a wide variety of rock 
types and caused by widely differing geological processes, caves range in size 
from single small rooms to interconnecting passages many miles long. The 
scientific study of caves is called speleology. It is a composite science based 
on geology, hydrology, biology and archeology, and thus holds special interest 
for earth scientists. Caves have been natural attractions since prehistoric 
times. Prolific evidence of early man's interest has been discovered in caves 
scattered throughout the world. Skeletons of some of the earliest manlike 
creatures (Australopithecines) have been discovered in cave deposit in South 
Africa, and the first evidence of primitive Neanderthal man was found in 
Germany. Cro-Magnon man created his remarkable murals on the walls of caves in 
France.<BR><BR><B>#</B> "Primitive human form originated in

Although invaders represent the threat to the conservation of flora and fauna, 
there are two special cases in which invasion have been deliberately brought 
about. One is the desire to control pests by natural predators, which may have 
to be brought from other countries. The second is releasing organisms into the 
wild (or on to farms, from which they might escape) that are completely novel, 
because they have been genetically engineered. There is nothing intrinsically 
sinister about engineered organisms, but any novelty must be regarded as 
potential invader. <BR><BR><B>#</B> "Pests are more dangerous than their natural

Life in colonial times was harsh, and the refinements of the mother country were 
ordinarily lacking. The colonists, however, soon began to mold their English 
culture into the fresh environment of new land. The influence of religion 
permeated the entire way of life. In most Southern colonies, the Anglican church 
was the legally established church. In New England, the Puritans were dominant; 
and in Pennsylvania, the Quakers. Especially in the New England colonies, the 
local or village church was the hub of community life; the authorities strictly 
enforced the Sabbath and sometimes banished non-believers. Unfortunately, the 
same sort of religious intolerance, bigotry and superstition associated with the 
age of Reformation in Europe also prevailed in some of the colonies, though on a 
lesser scale. In the last half of the 17th century, during sporadic outbreak of 
religious fanaticism and hysteria, Connecticut authorities tried and hanged 
several women as "witches". Early in the 17th century, some other witchcraft 
persecution occurred in Virginia. As the decades passed, however, religious 
tolerance developed in colonies.<BR><BR><B>#</B> "New England was part of the

Organizing the home can be perceived as conferring power, so large numbers of

found that, out of 65 new marriages, not one single wife expected her husband to

half as much as more free time at weekends than his wife, and the typical new

Statistics show that millions of vehicles have been carried by shuttle over the 
past 30 years through Alpine tunnels without one ever catching fire. In the 
Alpine tunnels, drivers and passengers sit in their vehicles on the shuttle 
trains. Only one vehicle has ever caught fire on the busy French motorail 
equivalent system. This sort of accident is not possible in a closed shuttle. 
Assertion that a vehicle fire will lead to catastrophe have no basis. Since the 
resources exist to detect, control and extinguish a fire, and to remove any 
persons present safely to an adjoining wagon, leaving any surviving fire facing 
rapid extinction within a wagon built to contain fire for 30 minutes, 
catastrophe seems very unlikely.<BR><BR><B>#</B> " It is theoretically possible
