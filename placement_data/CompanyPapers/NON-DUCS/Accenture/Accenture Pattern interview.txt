             I am a 2004  passout  B.E(CSE) Fresher.I had taken the ACCENTURE  written test on last sunday.I cleared that.Next was HR Interview + Technical Interview on following days.Acutally Questions for Written test Comprises of
1.Aptitude(Analytical(15)+Quantiapps(10)+Mental(10)) = 35 Questions
2.Technical (C(20) & C++(20) Questions)               = 40 Questions
For Aptitude R.S Agarwal is enough to crack this.For technical u have to grill the "Test ur C & C++ Skill" books.Most of the questions r repeated from prev. question paper.
In C++,Mostly from Polymorphism,inheritence,virtual functions,constructors.
