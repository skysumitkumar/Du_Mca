Subject: [CHETANA] (PAPER) Sapient paper held on 17 jan at hyd


Hi All,
    
I am very new to the group and this is my first mail.
I have given sapient test on 17th jan in hyderabad. i
applied thru mafoi consultants (advertisement in
accent 3rd dec).
They had 3 different kinds of test.

The test contained 3 questions:

1. design a class diagram or date model for this
problem:

A company has some clients and some officers. Also it
has some rooms to be used for meetings between client
and officers. one officer is responsible for each
room.  and room has unique room id. a meeting will be
aranged only when the officer and client are free and
room is also free. the officer and clients must be
registered to the system which will give them unique
email ids. arrange the meetings. dont write ode.

2. write a program to find the occurance of charachers
'!', '$' '?' '.' ',' etc. Also write a function to
replace all odd occurance of '?' to '.'.

3. there was a given program to insert a value at the
proper postion in a doubly linked list. there was some
logical error in that due to which it was not working
properly. find out that error. it was easy.

wishing u all the best
Abhinav
