SECTION 3
 
 
SECTION III - ANALYSIS PROGRAM SEGMENTS
1) Here is the structure declaration of a doubly
linked list
struct dlink {
int nodeid;
struct dlink *next;
struct dlink *prev;
} dlink_t;
A pointer of the head of the linked list is
maintained
as a global variable,
whose definition is
dlink_t *head;
The funtion remove_element(dlink_t *rp), needs to remove the node pointed to the rp and adjust the head.
The first node’s prev and the last node’s next are
NULL.
remove_element(dlink_t *rp)
 {
rp-prev-next = rp-next;
rp-next-prev = rp-prev;
if( head == rp)
head = rp-next;
Which of the following statement is true about the
function remove_element
A) It work when head is the same as rp
B) It does not work when rp is the last element on the list
c) It sets the head of the list correctly
D) It works in all cases
Answer :B
2) Consider the following function written in c:
#define NULL 0
char *
index(sp,c)
register char *sp,c;
 {
do {
if(*sp == c)
return (sp);
} while (*sp++);
return NULL;
 }
The first argument sp, is a pointer to a C string.
The
second
argument, c, is a character. This function scarches
for the character
c, in the string. If it is found a pointer to that
location is returned
else NULL is returned.
This function works
a) Always
b) Always, but fails when the first byte contais the
character c
c) works when c is a non NULL character only
d) Works only when the character c is found in the string answer: a
03) What is printed when this program is executed

a) 4 b) 5 c) 6 d) 7
answer: a
04) On a machine where pointers are 4 bytes long,
what
happens when the
following code is executed.
main()
 {
int x=0,*p=0;
x++; p++;
printf (“%d and %d\n”,x,p);
 }
a) 1 and 1 is printed b) 1 and 4 is printed
c) 4 and 4 is printed d) causes an exception
05) Which of the following is the correct code for
strcpy, that is

 }
c) strcpy (char *dst,char *src)
 {
while(*src)
{ *dst = *src;
dst++; src++;
 }
 }

 {
while(*++dst = *++src);
 }
answer:b

f1(j);
*j+=10;
f2(j);
printf(“%d and %d”,i,*j);
 }
f1(k)
int *k;
 {
*k +=15;
 }
 
f2(x)
int *x;
 {
int m=*x,*n=&m;
*n += 10;
 }
 
The values printed by the program will be
a) 20 and 55 b) 20 and 45 c) 45 and 45 ***d) 45 and 55
e) 35 and 35
 
 
9) Consider the following prg
