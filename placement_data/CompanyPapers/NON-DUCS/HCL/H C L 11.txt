Hcl paper

1) In  most of the data bases , to make changes to the table during trans. 
Ans commit
2) select * from employee to names which start with “FM”
ans  likeFM%
3) thrashing means
ans excessive page I/O
4) ans is view(DBMS ques)
5) no. of nodes in the binary tree with n leaves
6) M nodes are at level L then 2m nodes are at which level?
7) What do inodes represent?
8) What does union do?
9) Reference of locality benefits whom?        Ans    cache
10)   Ques on size of structure        ans   10


      rest of the  technical questions askesd were:
(repeated as in chandigarh)
1. printf(5+"fimisile");
Ans ile 
2. printf(3.1453)
ans error
3. printf("%d",printf("trim"));
ans trim4.
4. #define max (x,y) x>y?x:y
main()
{
int a=2,b=3,c;
c=max(a++,b++);
printf("%d %d %d",a,b,c);
}
5. complexity of merge sort
6 in a strictly comlete binary tree,if there are n leaf nodes then what would
be the total number of nodes in that binary tree.
7 if in a binary tree there are m nodes at level L then the number of nodes at

level (L - 1)
8.which one is costly using link list
ans binary search
9.class a
{
public:
int a;
virtual fun()
{
printf("WE are in class a");
}
};
class b : public a
{
public :
fun()
{
printf("we are in class b");
}
}
void main()
{
a *obj;
b c;
obj=&c;
obj->fun();
}

10. class a
{
public:
int a;
fun()
{
printf("WE are in class a");
}
};
class b 
{
public :
fun()
{
printf("we are in class b");
}
};
class c:public a,public b
{
public :
fun()
{
printf("we are in c");
}
}
void main()
{
c obj;
obj.fun();
}
11. class a
{
public:
a(){}
~a(){}
};
class b:public a
{
public:
b(){}
~b(){}
};
order in which constructor and destructor will execute
ans a(),b(),~b(),~a()
12. four processes are there and each one needed 2 instance of resource type
R the number of resources 

such that system will in safe state.
13. three dimesional array is given and the base address is given find the
address of a[0][0]
14 struct a
{
int a;
union{
long b;
float c;
}d;
};
if int take 2 bytes long 8 bytes float 4 bytes find the size of
struct a 
15 size of long
a. 2 b. 4 c os dependent d compiler dependent.
16 there is query in dbms to select a row with name starting from fm
ans like "fm%"
17 three more question on dbms
18. one question on page replacement it is frequently in use and has a high
counter value which algorithm will replace this page
a FCFS 2 LRU 3 MFU 4 LFU
19 one program on abstract class in c++;
20 class a
{
static int count=0;
show()
{
cout<<count;
}
}; 
void main()
{
a b,c,d;
a.show();
}
21 printf("He \n lo\r l");
22 main()
{
static int a[]={0,1,2,3,4};
static int *p[]={a,a+1,a+2,a+3,a+4};
int **ptr=p;
printf("%d %d \n",a,*a};
printf("%d %d %d\n",p,*p,**p};
printf("%d %d %d\n",ptr,*ptr,**ptr};
}
23 char ((*(*p())[])() ---------------> pointer to a
function returning array of ponters to function returning character
