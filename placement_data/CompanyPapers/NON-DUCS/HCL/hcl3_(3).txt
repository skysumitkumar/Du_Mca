 SECTION III - ANALYSIS PROGRAM SEGMENTS
 ---------------------------------------

1) Here is the structure declaration of a doubly
linked list

 struct dlink {
     int    nodeid;
     struct    dlink    *next;
     struct    dlink    *prev;
 } dlink_t;

A pointer of the head of the linked list is maintained
as a global variable, whose definition is
 dlink_t *head;

 The funtion remove_element(dlink_t *rp), needs to
remove the node
pointed to the rp and adjust the head.

The first node's prev and the last node's next are
NULL.

 remove_element(dlink_t *rp)
 {
     rp->prev->next = rp->next;
     rp->next->prev = rp->prev;
     if( head == rp)
         head = rp->next;
  }
Which of the following statement is true about the
fution remove_element

A) It work when head is the same as rp
B) It does not work when rp is the last element on the
