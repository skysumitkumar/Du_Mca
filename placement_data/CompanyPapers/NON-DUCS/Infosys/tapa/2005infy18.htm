  LOCATION&nbsp; : <b> CHENNAI</b><br>
  ------------------------------------------------</font>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">HI friends<br>
  This is Elavarasan, I thank u all for Ur help. When I got the call letter I
  had no hope of doing it, but the valuable information that u all gave made me
  to clear Infosys Aptitude test, but…I didn’t do the Interview well, sorry
  not even fine! All because<br>
  of my carelessness. In this mail I am giving u the way how I prepared for the
  written test and along with that my Interview questions. I hope u all would
  have<br>
  got enough “aptitude test” question papers so I am leaving that.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Preparation</b><br>
  I got the hall ticket on 31st August 2005. A week before that I went through
  about 100 puzzles in Shakuntala Devi’s “Puzzle to puzzle you”. I found
  that very boring and took many days to go through. As soon as I got the hall
  ticket I send a mail requesting for help to all my mailing groups. I received
  lot of help from the groups. I seriously prepared for the exam for about 4
  days. In that 4 days I finished two books of Shakuntala devi ( “puzzles to
  puzzle you” and “more puzzles” ). Then I took George Summers’ puzzle
  book. It was very tough and I lost my hope and concentration. I spent 2 days
  in George Summers, but I was able to go through only 17 problems in that. Then
  I had four days left. I started to prepare previous year question papers. I
  first started with the latest one i.e., 2005 papers, then I worked<br>
  out 2004 question papers. I noticed many question were repeating and gave an
  extra attention to the repeating questions. I also went through R.S.Agarwal
  for<br>
  problems on age, time and work, time and distance and clock. This is all I
  did.<br>
  <br>
  <b>The Exam</b><br>
  My exam venue was at Meenakshi College, Chennai. When the question paper was
  given I found most of the questions were from previous test papers. I was able
  to answer many questions without solving them (but I neatly presented the
  steps in the<br>
  paper), because I solved those questions many time while I was preparing for
  the test. But even then it was highly impossible for me to answer the entire
  question set in time. I left 3 questions. The English section was very easy
  and I completed that very quickly.<br>
  <br>
  <b>The result</b><br>
  I didn’t have any hope of getting selected. But to my surprise I found my
  name in the<br>
  notice board and time for the Interview was printed next to that as 2:00 P.M.
  As it was very crowded, I just saw my name and the time, but didn’t see the<br>
  Venue!!!!!<br>
  <br>
  <b>Interview</b><br>
  For interview, I just went through my project. The next day I dressed well and
  went to Meenakshi College exactly at 2.00 P.M for attending Interview. Only
  after going there I came to know that the venue was at Infosys campus which is
  about 30 K.M<br>
  from the college. I felt “Oh my God, I made a very big mistake!” and
  immediately phoned Infosys but both the phone numbers were busy! Without
  knowing what to<br>
  do I dove to Infosys campus (In the heavy traffic ofChennai city). After
  clearing the security I went to the interview block. I was 1hr late for the
  interview.<br>
  I met the coordinator for 2 o clock batch and apologized him for my mistake.
  He was very kind and spoke to me calmly. Then came a senior officer (He<br>
  must be a senior HRD manager), He was very angry on me and he didn’t seemed
  to be convincing. I was already scared about the interview, added with that
  his<br>
  tension made me feel very bad. I was immediately called for the interview (I
  didn’t even have a second to wash my dusty face or comb my hair!!).<br>
  In the interview panel there were twoladies. Here I use L1, L2, and ME, for
  the<br>
  interviewers and me. And… here is my interview.<br>
  <br>
  ME-- Good Evening mam.</font>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">L1 and L2-- Good Evening.</font>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">ME-- I am extremely sorry
  for being late. I should have been here by 2 o clock but I taught the venue
  was at Meenakshi College and I went there, only after going there I came to
  know that the venue is here, that is why I am late mam.</font>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">L2-- Didn’t you see ur
  venue yesterday?</font>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">ME-- Mam there was heavy
  rush at Meenakshi College yesterday, so once I saw my name and my interview
  time I left.</font>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">L1-- didn’t u consult
  with any others?</font>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">ME-- no mam.</font>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">ME—just now I came here
  so may I have some water mam?</font>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">L1—sure have some and
  make comfort.</font>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">ME—Thank you mam</font>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">L1—So, Ela..va…rasan
  Ariv….ala…gan, is this the way others call u?</font>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">ME –Yes mam, but few of
  my friends call me as “Prince”.</font>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">L1 – Prince! Why?</font>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">ME – because... (L2
  interrupted and said to L1 that the word “Elavarasan” in Tamil means
  Prince)</font>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">L2 – Ok Elavarasan, tell
  us about you.</font>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">ME – I started with my
  home town, then about my family, then about my education about my hobbies and
  finally the prizes won in competitions.</font>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">L2 – What do u think as
  ur greatest strength Elavarasan?</font>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">ME – I think, my greatest
  strength is my commitment to work. If I am committed to do something I make
  sure that it has completed. (After a pause) I don’t care<br>
  about the amount of work I have to put forward or the amount of time it takes
  to complete the task.</font>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">L2 – So, ur greatest
  weakness?</font>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">ME – mam I think it is
  time management. I concentrate much on fine details and always leave time.</font>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">L2 – Have u faced any
  problem because of that?</font>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">ME – yes mam, even while
  preparing for my exams if I struck up in a topic I wouldn’t move to next
  topic.</font>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">L1 – Elavarasan, let us
  think that u have joined the company and after joining the company you are
  asked to go to California, where there is a threat that Bin<br>
  Laden is going to attack California. All the seniors don’t want to go
  because of the threat so you are chosen, because you are a fresher. So, what
  will u do in such a situation?

  ME – I’ll go to
  California.</font>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">L1 – what? Is that
  practical? Be pragmatic are u ready to risk Ur life for a company?</font>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">ME – mam I am practical.
  If the death is going to come for a man it will come to him, no matter where
  he is even if he stays in India he will face death.</font>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">L2 – Then you are ready
  to go into a burning house?</font>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">ME – mam it’s a burning
  house, I know it is burning so, I will not go in. But going to California is
  not like that, there is a threat that’s all. It may happen or it may not
  happen.</font>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">L1 – Will ur parents
  accept this and send u to California?</font>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><br>
  ME – mam we all do believe in God. If he is my protector then I believe that
  he will protect me at California too. (After a while)</font>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><br>
  L2 – Think of a scenario in which u are the only person in ur college
  selected to do a project. That requires a lot of preparation and work. If u do
  that u will gain a lot of technical knowledge. At the same time you are chosen
  by ur principal to do another project which is not very important for u but
  very important for ur principal. He wanted u to do it. Both of the project
  requires heavy work and heavy<br>
  preparation, and u need to submit a report about Ur projects daily. What will
  u do in this situation?&nbsp;</font>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">ME – mam, firstly I’ll
  talk to my principal and will tell him about my situation.</font>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">L2 – If he is very
  adamant that u must do that project?</font>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">ME –I’ll take both the
  project and try to do them, that’s all I can do</font>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">L1 – How can it be
  possible to allocate time in such a tight schedule between two different
  projects?</font>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">ME – I know it is very
  difficult but there is no other go, so, I have to do that so...</font>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">L1 – Won’t u try any
  other method?</font>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">ME – no, mam first I’ll
  speak to him; if he compels me I will do the work.</font>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">L1—try to solve this
  puzzle (she game me puzzle in a small bit of paper) The puzzle read like this
  “ Starting with 1 half cup of coffee and 1 half cup of tea, if u take 1
  teaspoon of tea and mix it to the coffee and then u take a teaspoon of that
  mixture and mix it with the tea. At last what will be more coffee or tea? “.
  It is very easy puzzle; the answer is both the content remains same. But I
  taught in a different way and answered wrongly!!!</font>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">ME – mam coffee will be
  more.</font>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">L1 – (with a smile)
  Justify it.</font>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">ME – If u takes a
  teaspoon of tea and put it into coffee… (I shouldn’t have used “put”
  here) tea gets diluted. If u take a teaspoon of that mixture and add it to
  tea, that would have had more coffee in that than tea.</font>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">L1 – try this puzzle.<br>
  She gave me another simple puzzle “If the only sister of your mother’s
  only brother has only one child then what is the relationship between u and
  that child?” Can you imagine a simplest puzzle than this? But my mind worked
  in a different way and answered completely wrong. The actual answer is
  “yourself”, but I in a hurry answered “my cousin”!!!</font>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">ME – mam , it is my
  cousin.</font>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">L1 and L2 – what? (At the
  same time)</font>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">L1 – may be u have to
  read it again Elavarasan.</font>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">ME – (After a while) I
  think it should be my cousin.</font>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">L1 – how?</font>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">ME – If my mother’s
  brother had a sister then, she must be my mother’s sister too, hence her
  child must be my cousin.</font>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">L2 – (with lowered voice
  as if I have done the interview badly) Elavarasan, do u have any question?</font>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">ME – Hmmm no mam.</font>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">L1 – Ok , you may leave
  now.</font>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">ME – Thank u mam (and
  left the room, I was about to close the door, some think blinked in my mind
  only then I realized that the answer to the last puzzle was just “me”, I
  again felt “Oh my God another big mistake”)<br>
  <br>
  After my interview was over I was asked to sit in a place and my ID was taken
  to get signed from the HR manager. He was no other than the person who was
  angry<br>
  at me when I went late. He went to my interview panel and spoke for a while
  with the interviewers. This made me sure that I would not be selected. After a
  while he came with the very same angry face and gave my ID to my coordinator.
  He called out my name and asked me to return the ID to the security.<br>
  <br>
  My Advice<br>
  So, friends, don’t ever be careless like me and loose a valuable moment in
  your life. It will be a very big lose.</font><br>
