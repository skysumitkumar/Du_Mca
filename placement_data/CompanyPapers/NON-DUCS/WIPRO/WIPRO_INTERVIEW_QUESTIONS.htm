<P class=MsoPlainText>Rahul Bhargava<BR>--------------<BR><BR>There was a 
technical interview followed by the HR interview. Following were the questions 
asked:<BR><BR>Technical:<BR><BR>1.Tell me about yourself<BR>(A brief description 
of yourself followed by what your technical skills are)<BR><BR>2.I'll first ask 
some questions on Software Engineering, followed by those in C and then about 
your projects.<BR>(Though I didn't mention SE in my resume nor did I mention any 
project in SE, he was keen to ask questions in SE)<BR><BR>3. What are the 
different models of SDLC?<BR>4. Differentiate between Spiral and Incremental 
model?<BR>5. What is the disadvantage of Incremental model? Give an example to 
explain.<BR>6. What do you mean by the Design phase? What are the tools that can 
be used in this phase?<BR>7. Coming to C, what is hashing? Why do we use hashing 
and not arrays? How do we implement a Hash table? <BR>8. What are function 
pointers? Give the syntax for the same.<BR>9. Why do we use pointers in C at 
all?<BR>10. You know about structures and union. Why is Union used? Give a real 
life example in which you'll use union?<BR>11. What is SSL?<BR>12. What is the 
difference between HTTP and HTTPS?<BR>13. Explain two of your projects (one 
should be FYP).<BR><BR>(This round took around 20 minutes)<BR><BR>HR 
:<BR><BR>The interview was such that no prior preparation could be done. The 
only preparation required was for questios like why did you skip some companies. 
If you say you skipped 6 companies for Wipro, you need to convince them why did 
you do so for a company like Wipro. They too don't expect that you'll give that 
kind of answer. you should just have a reason behind your selection of 
companies.<BR><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR>1. Tell me about 
yourself. She picked up some points in between and asked about them.<BR>2. (We 
were asked to fill a form containing our details, including strengths and 
weaknesses) She asked about the weaknesses. Tell how you are trying to overcome 
that weakness.<BR>3. What were the companies whose tests you took before 
Wipro?<BR>A. Oracle and Convergys.<BR>4. Why not TCS and Infosys?<BR>5. Why 
Wipro now? How can it help you in building your career?<BR>6. Are you hopeful in 
getting into Wipro?<BR>7. My questions end here, do you have any questions to 
ask?<BR>(I asked about the difference in the nature of training provided two 
months before joining Wipro and the three months training provided after joining 
Wipro.)<BR><BR>(This round took around 15 minutes)<BR>The questions in HR were 
easier as compared to the those asked last year as they involved knowledge about 
self only. What I judged was that they were looking at communication skills, 
clarity of goals, strengths and weaknesses.<BR><BR>These are the questions I 
remember. Though there were some more based on my 
answers.<BR><BR>********************************************************************<BR><BR>B
