                        SECTION-A
 
 you should write the programs for the following problems in C.
 
 1. swapping two variables x,y without using a temporary variable.
 2. a program has been given asking to find the output
        ans. it is algorithm for finding G.C.D
 3. write a program for reversing the given string.
 4. the integers from 1 to n are stored in an array in a random
    fashion. but one integer is missing. write a program to find the
    missing integer.
        ans. idea. the sum of n natural numbers is = n(n+1)/2.
             if we subtract the above sum from the sum of all the
             numbers in the array , the result is nothing but the
             missing number.
 5. some bit type of questions has been given on pointers asking to
    to find whether it is correct from syntax point of view. and if
    it is correct explain what it will do.(around 15 bits).
 
                        SECTION-B
 
   ANSWER AS MANY AS POSSIBLE.
 
 6.& 7. two programs on pre-processor directions has been given asking

THIS PAPER HAS GIVEN IN IIT DELHI , SO GO THROUGH THIS IT WILL GIVE 
ROUGH IDEA;


1.   typedef struct{
	char *;
	nodeptr next;
	} * nodeptr;
what does nodeptr stand for?

2. supposing thaty each integer occupies 4 bytes and each charactrer 
1 byte , what is the output of the following programme?

#include<stdio.h>
main()
{
 int a[] ={ 1,2,3,4,5,6,7};
char c[] = {' a','x','h','o','k'};
printf("%d\t %d ", (&a[3]-&a[0]),(&c[3]-&c[0]));
}
ans : 3  3

3. what is the output of the program?

#include<stdio.h>
main()
{
struct s1 {int i; };
struct s2 {int i; };
struct s1 st1;
struct s2 st2;
st1.i =5;
st2 = st1;
printf(" %d " , st2.i);
}

ans: nothing  (error)
expl: diff struct variables should not assigned using "=" operator.



4.what is the output of the program?

#include<stdio.h>
main()
{
int i,j;
int mat[3][3] ={1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9};
for (i=2;i>=0;i--)
 for ( j=2;j>=0;j--)
printf("%d" , *(*(mat+j)+i));
}

ans : 9 6 3 8 5 2 7 4 1

5.

fun(n);
}
int fun( int n)
{
int i;
for(i=0;i<=n;i++)
fun(n-i);
printf(" well done");

}
 howmany times is the printf statement executed for n=10?


ans: zero
expl: Befire reaching to printf statement it will goes to infinite loop.


6.what is the output of the program?

main()
{
struct emp{
	char emp[];
	int empno;
	float sal;
};
struct emp member = { "TIGER"};
printf(" %d %f", member.empno,member.sal);


ans: error. In struct variable emp[], we have to give array size.
 If array size given
ans is 0, 0.00



7. output of the program?

	# define infiniteloop while(1)
	main()
	{
	infiniteloop;
	printf("DONE");
}

ans: none
expl: infiniteloop in main ends with ";" . so loop will not reach end;
and the DONE also will not print.

8.  output of the program?
	
main()
{
int a=2, b=3;
printf(" %d ", a+++b);
}

ans:5
expl: here it evaluates as a++ + b. 

9. output of the program?

#define prn(a) printf("%d",a)
#define print(a,b,c) prn(a), prn(b), prn(c)
#define max(a,b)  (a<b)? b:a

main()
{
int x=1, y=2;
print(max(x++,y),x,y);
print(max(x++,y),x,y);
}


ans: 3 4 2

10. which of the following is the correct declaration for the function main() ?

ans: main( int , char *[])

11. if ptr is defined as

	int *ptr[][100];
	which of the following correctly allocates memory for ptr?

ans: ptr = (int *)(malloc(100* sizeof(int));

                      Interview Practice
                -------------------------------------
                                                                                     
Practicing for the interview means practicing several behaviors
- not    just answering questions. You must dress well, watch
your body    language and posture, practice your manners and eye
contact as well as    practice answering questions correctly,
smoothly, and with confidence.  The practice questions below, in
one form or another, account for a    large percentage of
interview questions. With each question, you are    given a
series of choices as to how you might answer the question.
When you select an answer, you will learn whether your answer is
correct-and why. Answering these questions will help you polish
your   interviewing techniques. The questions and answers in
this excercise   are generic and, in many cases, must be
tailored to your individual   situation. Still, the logic behind
the answer remains essentially the   same.
   
Why are you the best person for the job?  I 've held a lot of
positions like this one, and that experience    will help me
here." "Because I am good at what I do."

"Our discussion here leads me to believe this is a good place to
work."

"You need someone who can produce results, and my background and
experience are proof of my ability. For example..."

If asked a point blank question such as: Are you creative? Are
you  analytical?    Can you work under pressure? etc. What is
the best way to    answer?

of my ability to do the job.
   
3.My GPA is ------ which I don't think is too low, at least
compared to    my friends.

contributions and reward my efforts."

enough money    to support my lifestyle. I am a hard worker and
will give a concerted    effort to earn the money I need."
   
6. What do you know about our organization?
   
1."I've done a little homework and here is what I know about
your     organization...(cite examples)"
   
2."Everything I've seen and heard makes me want to be a part of
this organization. I understand your industry is ________ and
your primary customer is __________. A particularly exciting
part of your business    appears to be _________ ."
   
3."I know enough to know this is an exciting place to work. It
appears    to be fit for my career goals."
   
7. What is a weakness?
   
1. I get really frustrated with my co-workers when they whine
about    everything.

3.I haven't held a job yet so I don't know what my work style will be.
   
9. What are your strengths?
   
1."I am good at giving constructive criticism to my coworkers.
This    honesty is something I'm very proud of and have found
essential to    having open working relationships."
   
2."I consider myself to be very consistent. I have proven myself
to be    someone who can be counted upon to do what is
expected."
   
3."I would have to chose between two skills. I am very proud of
my    determination and ability to get things done. At the same
time, I am    very proud of my analytical abilities and problem
solving skills.  These skills combine to give me a unique
ability to solve problems and then implement the solutions."
   
 10. How would co-workers describe you?
   
1."They perceive me as a leader. The people who have worked with
me learned great deal and accomplished in many cases more than
they    thought possible."

needed and  the room to work when it was appropriate. I believe
a measure of a good manager is how much he is able to get done
through others."
   
3."They perceive me as someone who cared about them personally
and had high expectations. I get a great deal of satisfaction
from helping    others do their best. My former employees would
highlight three of my    priorities which are to build loyalty
and a team environment, obtain    results and develop people."
   
11. What did you like and dislike about college?
   
1. I didn't like the tremendous ammount of homework some
professors    assigned us. I liked those professors who
realized, I had a life outside of class.

organize events    and be a part of the planning team. I can't
really think of anything I    disliked, college was a wonderful
experience.
   
3.I liked having Wednesdays off. I think the thing I disliked
most was    living in the dorms.

opportunity. Could you tell me more about it?"

customer.

customer wanted to return an item she had obviously bought
several years ago, which was against store policy. I talked to
her calmly and explained our policies and encouraged her to shop
and I would exchange the item however I could not give a refund.

do so."
   
3."Money is not very important to me. I need to be able to pay
the    bills but the work environment is far more important to
me."
   
Face to Face Interview Preparation

So you have a job interview, NOW WHAT?

You have sent out hundreds of resumes and finally a Human
Resource person calls to schedule a time for you to come in for
a face to face interview.  This is a great company, and you
think you are perfect for the job.  Now, you must demonstrate
that to the hiring authority you are perfect for the position.

Here are some pointers to keep in mind when going in for the
interview.

Prepare - Do not go in attempting to "wing" it.  Keep in mind
there are lots of competitors for the job, and you will only
have this opportunity to impress the hiring authority.Research
and know the company, their history, products, services and
reputation.

Prepare answers to questions that will likely come up, like
"What is your biggest weakness?" "What is your greatest
failure?" "Describe your best and worse boss?" "Tell me
something about yourself?" "Why did you leave your last job?"
"How can you contribute to this company in this job?"

There will likely be a longer list of questions, each a
potential landmine that can eliminate you from the competition.
Keep your answers short and to the point.  Do not ramble.
Always be honest and avoid negative statements.  Wear your best
suit - The first impressions of a candidate are lasting.  It is
better to be over-dressed than under-dressed.  Your appearance
will demonstrate that you are taking the initiative.  Go out of
your way to make a good impression. Even if you never wear a
suit to work, even if it is a production job, the interviewer
will be pleased by your effort to impress.

Be on time - It is better for you to be early and wait for your
appointment time than to keep the interviewer waiting and
wondering.  If you miss your appointment time you may not get
another.  If a problem or emergency arises, and they do, call
immediately and explain and offer to come in at another time,
whenever is convenient for the interviewer.

Body language - Sit up, look attentive, do not cross your arms
or legs make eye contact.  Interviewers rely on body language to
determine your level of interest.

 Present a positive attitude - Companies seek pleasant and
positive people.

 Bring extra copies of your resume - You may interview with a
team of people, do not make them share one resume.

  Avoid smoking and drinking alcohol before and during an
interview.  If going to lunch with an interviewer, decline
alcholic beverages even if the interviewer orders a cocktail
with their meal.  If you are a smoker, abstain before and during
the interview.  Smoking can offend many people, even smoking
before an interview can leave an odor which may be offensive to
the interviewer.

 Do not lead with money or benefit questions in the initial
interview - If your main motivation is money it will probably
turn off most hiring authorities.  Convince them you can do the
job and want the job before discussing money and benefits.
Money, benefits and vacation will come up and can be discussed
should the company wish to make you an offer.

 Sell yourself - If you don't no one else will.  Use facts and
figures to quantify your experience and ability. Tell them the
things that will benefit the company if they hire you.

Show interest in the job - If you act cool they may not realize
that you want the job.  Companies want someone who is interested
and enthusiastic about the job and the company.  Don't make the
hiring authority guess if you want the job.

Do not close any doors - No matter what you see or hear during
the interview don't overreact.  Obstacles may come up regarding
money, relocation or other issues that can be resolved later if
you leave the issue open.

Getting an offer - If an offer is made to you during an
interview never, reject it outright.  Ask for time to think it
over to consider money and the specific details of the offer.
Always respond positively.  If you let them know you want the
job it will be a lot easier to negotiate items like salary
later.

When the Interview is over - Ask if there are any reservations
about your ability to do the job.  Deal with these now.  Ask
what is the next step in the interview  process.  If you like
the job and want an offer now is the time to tell them.  Do not
assume they will know if you want the job or not.

Follow-up - Be sure to send a note letting them know you
appreciate the opportunity to interview and reiterating  your
interest in the position.  Keep the note brief, and to the
point.

  

1.In my last job I dealt with customers at a retail store. One
customer wanted to return an item she had obviously bought

                   NOVEL  NETWORK PAPER
        *********************************************

The paper consists os three sections.
1. aptitude 15 questions 20 min.
2. system concepts 20 questions 20 min.
3. 'c'   15 questions 20 min.

NOTE:::::

I'm sendin the questions, somany have no answers. U do check the
answers  for all the given questions also.

All questions are MULTIPLE CHOICES ONLY.

U do try to cover the related topics to get some understanding.
In interview They are asking C C++ Operating system concepts
and Networks.
They will ask about Ur interesting subjects, U try to have good
grip on those intresting subjects.

They selected 11 out of 55 students.
 They asked about c c++ project work and OS,NETWORKS.
But they selected only 2 , one from CS and another is BTech ECE.


SECTION 1 is main factor selection to the interview


--------------------------------------------------------------
In the interveiw you should be very active .And should be frank to say 
no also.One CS student said that he don't know NETWORK and he hasn't 
taken NETWORKS subject.But he has selected.
      OK  BEST OF LUCK.


section 1::::;

*. GRE book test paper 3 section 5
question no. 8 to 12     (ships WXYZ starting on dec. 23rd..........)


* 5 programs are sheduled from monday to saterday, monday is not holiday,
PQRST are the programs. The day before P is holiday, and some other clues are
given, we have to find the sequence (4 questions)

ANS: tuesday is the holiday
     P comes on wednesday ,
     U can do the remaining very easily.
* Suppose U R the presoner, There are two guards Who will tell truth or
one will tell truth. There is a gate for liberty and another foe hell.

Some questions are given, like
    i. are U tell truth?
    ii. another tell truth or not??
    iii. both of U R telling truth??
    iV. both of U lieing??
    V. --------------


    they gave  a. b. c. d. and asking about which sequencing is sufficient to
    find the gate for liberty??
    ( I can't give exact thing)
 
* There are WIFE and HUSBAND at one side of river. They have one child,
They want to cross the river. The child can't be lonly. The boat boy won't
permit morethan one to cross the river, what is the correct way to
cross the river??

* There are 7  targets, A B and C has to shoot them. All should be shooted 
consicutively.
    1. The no. of chances for A and B are not less thn 2,
    2. for C there is only one chance.
    3. A can't shot 3 times consicutively.
    4. B is permited to shoot in even chances only.

    They have given some 3or 4 questions on this

* 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

section 3::

1.Max value of SIGNED int 
    a. b. c. d.
2.One questin is given, long one, to find the answer U should be 
femiliar
 with the operation as follows

 int *num={10,1,5,22,90};
 main()
 {
 int *p,*q;
  int i;
  p=num;
  q=num+2;
  i=*p++;
  print the value of i, and q-p, and some other operations are there.
  }
  how the values will change??
3. One pointer diff is given like this:
  int *(*p[10])(char *, char*)
  asked to find the    meaning.
4. char *a[4]={"jaya","mahe","chandra","buchi"};
   what is the value of    sizeof(a)/sizeof(char *)
   a. 4 b.bytes for char c-- d.--

PART 1

1). A beggr collects cigarette stubs and makes one ful  cigarette 
with every 7 stubs.  Once he gets 49 stubs .  How many cigarettes 
can he smoke totally.
                     Ans. 8
2). A soldiar looses his way in a thick jungle  at  random  walks 
from his camp but  mathematically  in  an  interestingg  fashion.  
First he walks one mile east then half mile to north.   Then  1/4 
mile to west, then 1/8 mile to south and so  on  making  a  loop. 
Finally hoe far he is from his camp and in which direction.
ans: in north and south directions 
   1/2 - 1/8 + 1/32 - 1/128 + 1/512 - and so on 
                = 1/2/((1-(-1/4))
      similarly in east and west directions
     1- 1/4 + 1/16 - 1/64 + 1/256 -    and so on 
             = 1/(( 1- ( - 1/4))
   add both the answers
3). hoe 1000000000 can be written as a  product  of  two  factors 
neither of them containing zeros
   Ans   2 power 9 x 5 ppower 9  ( check the answer )
4). Conversation between two mathematcians:
  first : I have three childern. Thew pproduct of their ages is  36 
.  If you sum their ages . it is exactly same as  my  neighbour's 
door number on my left. The  sacond  mathematiciaan  verfies  the 
door number and says that the not sufficient  .  Then  the  first 
says " o.k one more clue is that my youngest is the youngest"
Immmediately the second mathematician answers . Can  you  aanswer 
the questoion asked by the first mathematician?
What are the childeren ages?        ans  2 and 3 and 6
5). Light glows for every 13 seconds .  How  many  times  did  it 
between 1:57:58 and 3:20:47 am
      ans : 383 + 1 = 384

6). 500 men are  arranged in an array of 10 rows and 50 columns . 
ALL tallest among each row aare asked to   fall  out  .  And  the 
shortest among THEM is A. Similarly after resuming that to  their 
originaal podsitions that the shorteest  among  each  column  are
