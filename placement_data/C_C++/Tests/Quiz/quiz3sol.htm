<BODY><PRE></PRE><STRONG>Question 0 :</STRONG> <PRE>	In inheritance as we have studied it, private members of 
        the base class:

	a) Aren't inherited
	b) Are inherited but there is no way to access them in the
	   derived class
	c) Are inherited but they can only be accessed by member
	   functions of the base class which are either public or
	   protected
	d) Are inherited and they can be freely accessed in the
	   derived class	
<EM>Answer:</EM>
   c
</PRE><STRONG>Question 1 :</STRONG> <PRE>	Consider the following three classes
	
	class A
	{..........};

	class B : public A
	{..........};

	class C : public B
	{..........};

	What is order of invocation of destructors when delete is called 
        on a pointer to an object of class C?
	
	a) first ~A(), then ~B(), and then ~C()
	b) first ~C(), then ~B(), and then ~A()
	c) only the destructor of C is called
<EM>Answer:</EM>
   b
</PRE><STRONG>Question 2 :</STRONG> <PRE>	Consider the following three classes
	
	class A
	{..........};
	
	class B
	{..........};

	class C : public A, public B
	{..........};

	What is the order of invocation of constructors when an object
	of class C is instantiated?
	
	a) first C(), then B(), and then A()
	b) first A(), then B(), and then C()
	c) only C() is invoked
<EM>Answer:</EM>
   b
</PRE><STRONG>Question 3 :</STRONG> <PRE>	Consider the following code :
	
	class A {
	 public :
	  void fun1(void);
	  virtual void fun2(void);    };
	
	class B: public A {
	 public :
	  virtual void fun2(void);
	  void fun3(void);            };

	void main()
	{
	  A* ptr;
	  B bobj;
	  ptr = &amp;bobj;
	  .....          // &lt;--- inserted as this line
        }
	
	Which of the following lines of code would generate an error
	if inserted in main after the code shown above?

	a) ptr-&gt;fun1();
	b) ptr-&gt;fun2();
	c) ptr-&gt;fun3();
<EM>Answer:</EM>
   c
</PRE><STRONG>Question 4 :</STRONG> <PRE>	Say True or False (Enter t or f) :

	class C is publicly derived from class B, and
        class B is publicly derived from class A.

        An member function of C has access to protected members of A. 
<EM>Answer:</EM>
   t
</PRE><STRONG>Question 5 :</STRONG> <PRE>        How can we initialize private base class variables from a derived 
	  class constructor?

        a) We can assign values to the variables directly in the
	  derived class constructor
        b) We can call the base class constructor inside the {  }  
	  of the derived class constructor
        c) We can call the base class constructor after the function
	  header of the derived class constructor, with a : in-between 
	  the two 
        d) It is not possible to initialize private base class 
	  variables from a derived class constructor
<EM>Answer:</EM>
   d (we will award credit for C, but note that <B>we</B> can not initialize private data in the dervied
classes, rather we *need* to explicitly call the base member class constructor).
</PRE><STRONG>Question 6 :</STRONG> <PRE>      How does the phrase "old code calls new code" relate to 
       inheritance?

      a) dynamic binding allows old function calls to invoke new
	   function definitions
      b) protected access allows new classes to access old variables
	   directly
      c) the virtual keyword allows old classes to be overwritten by 
           new classes
      d) pure virtual functions allow old classes to force new 
	   classes to supply definitions for a function
<EM>Answer:</EM>
   a
</PRE><STRONG>Question 7 :</STRONG> <PRE>     Which of the following is not a kind of access permission?

      a) private
      b) programmed
      c) public
      d) protected
<EM>Answer:</EM>
   b
</PRE><STRONG>Question 8 :</STRONG> <PRE>        Say True or False (Enter t or f) :

	A pointer to type X can only point to objects of type X.
<EM>Answer:</EM>
   f
</PRE><STRONG>Question 9 :</STRONG> <PRE>       Which one of the following is true regarding the compiling
	and running of the line


		ptr-&gt;Fn();
       
       If ptr is a pointer to type Q and Fn() is a virtual function
	in class Q?

	a) function name and function definition both matched to type of
             pointer at compile time
        b) function name matched to pointer type at compile time; 	
	     function definition matched to type pointer points to at 
	     run time
        c) function name matched to pointer type at run time;        
             function definition matched to type pointer points to 
	     earlier, at compile time
        d) function name and function definition both matched to 
             type of object pointer points to at run time
<EM>Answer:</EM>
   b
