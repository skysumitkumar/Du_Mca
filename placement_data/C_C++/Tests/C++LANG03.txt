    Q.	Select appropriate choice for the following :


    1.	The size of the empty class is
	(a) 0 bytes	(b) 1 bytes	(c) 2 bytes	(d)none

    2.	What is the type of this pointer if class name is abc.
	(a) abc *const this	(b) abc const *this	(c) abc *this	(d) none

    3.	Can we create objects dynamically?
	(a) No		(b) Yes		(c) sometimes

    4.	Can a destructor be called explicitly to delete an object?
	(a) Yes 	(b) No
	
    5.	Does the delete operator call the destructor of the class?
	(a) Yes		(b) No

    6.	Can destructors be overloaded?
	(a) Yes		(b) No

    7.	By default, members of a structure are private & that of a class are also private.
	(a) True	(b) False

    8.	Nested classes are legal.
	(a) True 	(b) False
	
    9.	A class declaration creates space in memory for the members defined in it.
	(a) True	(b) False

    10. If a class contains a three-argument constructor then it is necessary to define 	explicitly a zero-argument, a one-argument and a two-argument constructor.

	(a) Yes 	(b) No		(c) Sometimes True and Sometimes False

    11. Size of an Object is not equal to sum of sizes of data members and member functions		within the class.
	(a) True	(b) False	(c) Only in special classes like anonymous class

    12. The this pointer always contains the address of the object using which the member 	function is being called.
	(a) True 	(b) False	

    13. The this pointer can also be used in global functions.
	(a) True	(b) False

    14. We can modify the this pointer.
	(a)True		(b)False

    15. OUTPUT OF :

	#include<iostream.h>
	class user 
	{
		private:
			int i;
			float f;
			char c;
		public:
			void displaydata()
			{
				cout<<endl<<i<<'\n'<<f<<"\n"<<c;
			}
	};
	void main()
	{
		cout<<sizeof(user);
		user u1;
		cout<<endl<<sizeof(u1);
		u1.displaydata();
	}


    16. OUTPUT OF :

	class date 
	{
		private:
			int date,month,year;
	
			date()
			{
				day=25;
				month=9;
				year=1979;
			}
	};
	void main()
	{
		date today;
	}	

	
    17. Is there any error :

	class a
	{
		int i;
	}
	
	main()
	{
		//code
	}


    18. can we apply delete on this pointer ( e.g. delete this ) inside member function?	
	(a) Yes		(b) No

    19. delete p deletes the pointer 
	delete p deletes the object being pointed to by p.
	
	(a) Ist statement is correct.
	(b) IInd statement is correct.
	(c) Both correct.
	(d) Both Wrong.

    20. Heap and Free Storage are two different things.
	(a) True	(b) False
