 Section I : Quantitive : 30 Qns 30 Min
 Level was moderate. Many students could make even all 30
 Section II : Analytical Ability : 15 Qns 15 Min
 Level was moderate.
 Section III : Engineering : 1 Hr
  
 was moderate. Have a feel with the following Qns:
  1. void foo1()
   {
   if(A<B) 
    Then {/*.... */}
   else
    if(C<D)
     then foo2()
   }
   How many time foo2() would get called given
   A<B 25% of the times and C<D 75% of the times and 
   foo1() is called 5000 times
  2. A parallel program if executed on a single processor takes N secs.
 40 % of the  
     the program is of sequntial nature. What is the least amount of
 time that the 
     program takes if executed on 
   a> 2 processors
   b> 4 processors
  3. Given a complete N ary tree. The no. of non leaf nodes is M. Then
 find
     out the total number of leaf nodes
  4. write an algo to calculate x^n in O(lg n) time
  5. 
   void foo(int n)
   {
    int h=n;
    while(h>0)
    {
    for( int i=1;i<=n;i++);
    h=h/2;
    }
   }
   What is the timing complexity of the function
  6. Give a finite automata which does not accept any string containing
 aabb
     Alphbet set is {a,b}
  7. There was a 32 bit Hexadecimal digit. You have to find out number
 of 1s
  8. 
   Void foo()
   {
   int counter=0
   for(int i=0;i<10;i++)
   {
    counter++;
    for(int i=0;i<10;i++)
     counter++;
   }
   What will be the final value of counter ?
  9. Given the Preorder and Inorder of a tree, we had to construct the
 tree
  10. and some more
 
 Section IV : C : 40 Mins
  Was easy
  1. what is the diff between  
   char *a="hello";
  and     char a[]="hello";
   Explain
 
  2. How to invert 20th bit
  3. Write programs :
   a> to find the max of three nums in one statement using ternary op.
   b> to implement atoi()
   c> to find the rightmost occurence of given pattern in a given
 string
   d> to print 1,1,2,3,5,.... 20 terms. Write recursive fun.
   e> to invert all odd bits of an int
  4. and other easy questions
 
Interview:
 2 tech each of around 1 hr and onr HR
 Important Questions of Interview :
  1. Find all the anagrams of a given word in the least amount of time.
 You are
     provided a dictionary which u can preprocess in any way
  2. You are receiving a continuous bit stream, one bit at a time. You
 have
     to tell when the number formed by the current and previous bit
 stream is
     divisible by 5. You are not allowed to store the info regarding
 the bits which 
     have already passed
  3. There is a sorted array. Some numbers from the start have been
 rotated left.
     [ just like left rotate with carry ]. Now give the algo of bin
 search to find
     an element in O(lg n) time
  4. You are given an array of sive n of positive and negative numbers.
 Also given
     another number k. U have to find whether the sum of any two of the
 numbers 
     from the array is equal to k in O(n) time.
  5. Some puzzles
  6. Some C questions
  7. And many more but moderately difficult questions from Algos and OS
 In HR : Some puzzles and some regular stuffs
 
Hope to see you there next Year.
Bye
