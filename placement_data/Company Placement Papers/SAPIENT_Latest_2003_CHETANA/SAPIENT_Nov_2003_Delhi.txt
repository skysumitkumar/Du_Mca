Subject: [CHETANA] [ Pattern + info] about Sapient India


hello guys,

i recently attended the first round for sapient at delhi. they asked to 
write 2 programs in any language. better if in C++ / java. the programs are 
very simple and u can get thru easily if u know a littile bit of 
programming.

1) in a trian compartment there are 67 seats...13 rows of 5 (3 by2) setats 
and the last row has 2 sets. a person cannot book more than 5 seats. if a 
person is bokin then it should be such that maximum people of the group get 
to sit in the same row.

2) i'm wrirng in a simple programming style here : in a sentece we have to 
compare each word from a list and replce it with "###" if it exists in th 
list.

hope that is helpful . for any more info do contact me.

--------------------------
in case anyone has info what will be there in the second technical round do 
let me know. the person  was talking abt some compression software program 
debugging

sapeksh
