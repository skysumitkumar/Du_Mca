Subject: [CHETANA] (Info)Sapient-Pattern


Hi 
regarding query of sapient pattern, even i appeared
for that, but could not clear beyond first round.
I appeared around 4 monhs ago and the first round
included the Group discussion and the Technical test.
-In group discussion, there were around 20 guys and
the topics were around 25 and everyone had to select
one topic from there.
-The persons in sequence are given a chance to choose
the topic from the list.
No two person can not  have the same topic for GD.
Topic were general like
1.If i were Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
2.The icon of my life.
3.............


In teh GD everyone was given around 3 minutes to speak
and the other guys got teh chance to ask anything
related with GD from him.

After teh GD there was technical test consisting  of 3
questions.
2 questions were related with the Data structure and u
have the choice to do it in either c, c++, or java.
3rd question is related with what do u feel abt the
company and why do u want to join this company.

--ALl the best 
Ashish
