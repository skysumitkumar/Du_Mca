For 1 MB memory, the number of address lines required,16

For a 25MHz processor , what is the time taken by the instruction which needs 3 clock cycles,

The n-th power of the 2 by 2 matrix can be computed efficiently in O(log n) time. 
This implies an O(log n) algorithm for computing the n-th Fibonacci number.

#include<stdio.h>
void main()
{
int x=3;
float y=3.0;
if(x==y)
printf("x=y");
else
printf("x!=y");
}
what would be the output. explanation is must. 

N is a Fibonacci number if and only if (5*N*N + 4) or (5*N*N - 4) is a perfect square!

for (j=1; j < base; j++)
sum += addition;
}

How to reverse the bits in an interger?


You are given a Double Link List with one pointer of each node pointing to the next node just like in a single link list.
b The second pointer however CAN point to any node in the list and not just the previous node.

Now write a program in O(n) time to duplicate this list. That is, write a program which will create a copy of this list. 



. Given a single link list with one info part containing single character and a link. 
Check whether the link list is a palindrome or not. 
The algo should run in Linear time only. 
You can't use any array or string to store the string of link-list.

2. Given a sentence ex:"I love Microsoft" reverse the string as "Microsoft love I".

The alog shoudl run in Linear time. You can't use any array or string to store the string.

3. Given an array which contains only 0's or 1's. Now arrange all the O's in the front of the array followed by all the 1's. 

The algo should have better time complexity than O(N).

4. Given a sentence ex: "Mississippi". Remove all the repetations and use the same string to store the resultant string.

The algo should run in Linear time. You can't use a different string to store the resultant string or the given string. 

5. Given a string ex: "aabccdcb". Find all size palindrome of the given string.

OUTPUT:-
aa
aabcc
cc
cdc
....
....
...

The algo should have a time complexity better than O(N^3). 




Given two unsorted circular linked list, write a program/algo to combine them into one 
sorted circular linked list in best possible way (i mean minimum time & space complexity)




Given a binary tree and a sum, return true if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that 
adding up all the values along the path equals the given sum. Return false if no such path 
can be found


Given a binary string x of length n, find the longest prefix of x in 
linear time which is a palindrome. 

How to Sort a Stack in ascending order


Given a linked list with 2n+1 element where exactly n numbers have duplicates and one 
number is single. (List is not sorted and number can be in any range). You have to find out 
the unpaired number

Can you write a C-code (or atleast algo) to find the least number from an array without 
using any of the comparison operators (<,<=,>,>=,==,!=)? 


Give a fast way to multiply a number by 7.

flip 2^15-1 bits....

Write, efficient code for extracting unique elements from
     a sorted list of array.  e.g. (1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 9, 9, 9, 9) ->
     (1, 3, 5, 9).



An array of integers. The sum of the array is known not to overflow an integer. 
Compute the sum. What if we know that integers are in 2's complement form

What is the simples way to check if the sum of two unsigned integers has resulted in an overflow. 

Convert (integer) number in binary without loops.

#include<stdio.h>
#include<conio.h>

	char **p="Hello";
	printf("%s",**p);
	getch();
}

to invert all odd bits of an int


There was a 32 bit Hexadecimal digit. You have to find out number of 1s

You are given an array of n of positive and negative numbers. Also given
     another number k. U have to find whether the sum of any two of the numbers 
     from the array is equal to k in O(n) time.(array is not sorted)

 There is a sorted array. Some numbers from the start have been rotated left.
     [ just like left rotate with carry ]. Now give the algo of bin search to find
     an element in O(lg n) time


 Find all the anagrams of a given word in the least amount of time. You are
     provided a dictionary which u can preprocess in any way


 You are receiving a continuous bit stream, one bit at a time. You have
     to tell when the number formed by the current and previous bit stream is
     divisible by 5. You are not allowed to store the info regarding the bits which 
     have already passed

Given a complete N ary tree. The no. of non leaf nodes is M. Then find
     out the total number of leaf nodes

Find Two Numbers in A BST Sum of These Equal to K


Given N numbers how will you partition them so that 
They are split into two sets so that the sum of the numbers of each set 
when subracted from the sum of the numbers of other set should be 
minimum i.e say S is a set of N numbers partition it so that you will 
be able to get a mimimum possible value called k, so that 
sum(S1) - sum (s2) = k or sum(s2) - sum(s1) =k . depending on which sum 
is greater.
