I am sachin from belgaum Karnataka. I would like to share my experience about campus recruitment for SAPIENT.

Sapient had come to BVB college of Engg, Hubli, Karnataka on 25th August 2007 for 1st round of campus recruitment. Only CS and MCA domain are eligible for this company and here it was a pool campus for all North Karnataka. Guys let me tell you that I did not knew anything about this company. They did not give any ppt and directly took the first round in which we had to write a program which is as follows:

Instruction:
1. You have to write code for the following program.
2. You can use any language but (Java, C++ preferable)
3. Do not write any input function or main function.
4. Please complete feed back form
5. Make required assumption.
6. Do write comment where necessary.
7. Follow flowchart and algorithm if required.
Construct an online registration of symbiosis entrance exam. The user must be given preferences for location (atleast three preferences). Consider some maximum entries in each location. If the registration are over then the next preference must be given as a choice and so on, there must be preference for date also each location will have 2 dates on which the exam will be conducted. The user must enter his preference for date as well as location. Considering the constraints for each location and date a valid 
choice must be given to the user.

Guys many constraints were given I can't remember everything. This was the abstract problem definition.

After about 7 days our placement officer told that I and along wit me 9 from our college have been selected for the 2nd round. Our 2nd round was in the Company's office itself in Bangalore on 15th Sep 2007.
Around 70 had made it till the 2nd round, they were from many places including Tamilnadu and Andhra Pradesh.

In the 2nd round we were given another program to write, as follows:
Instructions same as above:

Program 1.
Reservation: there are 67 seats in train. there are only 5 seats in a row and in last row there are only 2 seats. One person can reseve only 5 seat at a time. If person reserving seat, care is taken that he may get all in row. if seats are not available in row then the arrangement is so that person group get nearby seats.

the following class is given
public class seat
{
char name;
int seat;
boolean isSeatempty
}

1. Draw require class digram and object diagram.

2. Write function seatallot(int noofperson) 
to allocate seat with seat number printed for the each name.

After this round everyone was called for tech interview there wasn't any short listing

Now I will tell u the most interesting part that was my interview. I was the first person to be called and it was a cool 1hr 15min interview. The hr himself called me. I was being asked to jus sit for a while outside his cabin and I saw he was'nt doing anything inside. I think he was testing my patience. After some time he called me in. After wishing him he told me to sit.
http://www.ChetanaS.org
The interesting part of this interview was that first he gave me his introduction and then asked abt me. He was too cool and quite young he was just 28. He asked me to call him by his name but I told him I am comfortable calling sir.

Then he asked me to explain the entire code (2nd program). For everthing what I was telling him he would give me some instances about that program and asked me solve it. I did it very easily.

Actually Sapient has one more round called business round same as HR round but due to time constraints they merged wit tech round. Here he asked me some basic hr question like y sapient? N all such things also he would put me in some situations like he asked me if any project partners leave the project then wat will u do? Etc etc...

After the interview first he asked me to give his feedback and then he asked me to ask any question about Sapient. I did ask a few. Then he told me that result will be sent to our college placement officer. After 2 days I got a call from my p.o that I was selected and what else we had a party that day...
Thank u

I have attended the sapient written test on 5th Dec-04. Paper was on also 4th dec. There were around 3000-4000 guys attend this. 4th Dec paper had the same pattern- 2 programming ques. but... next day we had the different pattern.

Pattern was
  English-45 ques
  Quantative Aptt.-15
  Technical Skills-15
  Total time -1 hour

In Eng.

  10 synonyms and 10  antonyms
  5  odd man out- They were tough one
  10 ques- arrange 5 sentences in meaningful way- easy
  10 ques- Find same relationship as given-They were  also tough one

In QA- ques like
http://www.ChetanaS.com
  on interest, probability, train, work & time from    R.S.Agarwal
1. A family has 3 childrens one of them at least girl. Find the probability of having both girls.
2. 4 pairs of husband wife.Find the no. of ways they can play mixed double match.

In Tech part

  ques from C & C++  must have thorogh knowledge- not a tough one.

that was all. Result will be declared within 2 weeks   

=============================================================================================================================================================================================================
I have given sapient test on 17th jan 2004 in hyderabad. I applied thru mafoi consultants (advertisement in accent 3rd dec). They had 3 different kinds of test.

The test contained 3 questions:

1. design a class diagram or date model for this problem:
A company has some clients and some officers. Also it has some rooms to be used for meetings between client and officers. one officer is responsible for each
room.  and room has unique room id. a meeting will be aranged only when the officer and client are free and room is also free. the officer and clients must be
registered to the system which will give them unique email ids. arrange the meetings. dont write ode.

2. write a program to find the occurance of charachers '!', '$' '?' '.' ',' etc. Also write a function to replace all odd occurance of '?' to '.'.

3. there was a given program to insert a value at the proper postion in a doubly linked list. there was some logical error in that due to which it was not working
properly. find out that error. it was easy.
====================================================================================================================================

31 dec 2003
I have attended second round of written and interviews for sapient at banglore. The written was similar to first round. 

Written
--------

1) Write a program for the problem: the array of inetegers indicating the marks of the students is given, U have to calculate the percentile of the students aaccording to this rule: the percentile of a student is the %of no of student having marks less then him. For eg: suppose 

Student        Marks
A              12
B              60
C              80
D              71
E              30 
F              45      

percentile of C =  5/5 *100 = 100 (out of 5 students 5 are having marks less then him)

percentile of B  = 3/5*100 = 60% (out of 5, 3 have markses less then him)

percentile of A = 0/5*100 = 0%.

2) The code was given for a problem and u have to identitfy the logical error in it. That was simple. The code was to merge the Danagrams of 2 words. The danagram of a word is the letters of word arranfed in sequential order. eg danagram of abhinav is aabhinv. merging of danamagram is to merge the danagrams of 2 or more words such that the highest no of occurance are coming for each alphabet.eg

merging of aabhinv and abbhhixz is aabbhhinvxz.


Technical interview:
--------------------
discussion on the written paper. how did u solved the problem? expain him about that. small discussion on yr project for a while. simple techinal questions related to project. simple langugae question : Collections in java.. types of joins in SQL. if u want to ask something about sapient etc?

HINT: ask something good. eg kind of projecst they are doing.. processes they follow .. how do they capture the requirements .. etc..


Business Inteview:
------------------
Hr inteview.. behaviorial questions.. how will u react in some conditions.. how how did u reacted.. 
1) give an example when yr boss is not aggreed with u. what did u do? 
2) give an example when u had a clash with yr peer. what did u do? 
3) give an example when u faced some ambigious situation.(when u are not understanding the things properly ) what did u do? 
4) give an example when u faced some stressful situation.what did u do? 
5) did u make some decision of yr own to carray out something. and suggested this to yr boss and yr boss aggreed?
etc..

what do u want to ask.

HINT : ask some good ques. like how open the envrionment is? is a junior person part of design?? what is the responsibility of a member for the proper
working of project?


Busines Interview 2
-------------------
This was more of type 2 only. but they will tell about sapient. and u may ask as many quest as u want. now u can again ask the same ques ased in previous 2
interviews.

SAPIENT PLACEMENT PAPER - 3 


1) Write a program for the problem: the array of 

inetegers indicating the marks of the students is 

given, U have to calculate the percentile of the 

students aaccording to this rule: the percentile of a 

student is the %of no of student having marks less 

then him. For eg: 

suppose 



Student Marks 

A 12 

B 60 

C 80 

D 71 

E 30 

F 45 



percentile of C = 5/5 *100 = 100 (out of 5 students 5 

are having marks less then him) 

percentile of B = 3/5*100 = 60% (out of 5, 3 have 

markses less then him) 

percentile of A = 0/5*100 = 0%. 



2) The code was given for a problem and u have to 

identitfy the logical error in it. That was simple. 

The code was to merge the Danagrams of 2 words. The 

danagram of a word is the letters of word arranfed in 

sequential order. eg danagram of abhinav is aabhinv. 

merging of danamagram is to merge the danagrams of 2 

or more words such that the highest no of occurance 

are coming for each alphabet.eg 



merging of aabhinv and abbhhixz is aabbhhinvxz.

Sapient Paper


The test contained 3 questions: 

1. design a class diagram or date model for this 
problem: 

A company has some clients and some officers. Also it 
has some rooms to be used for meetings between client 
and officers. one officer is responsible for each 
room. and room has unique room id. a meeting will be 
aranged only when the officer and client are free and 
room is also free. the officer and clients must be 
registered to the system which will give them unique 
email ids. arrange the meetings. dont write ode. 

2. write a program to find the occurance of charachers 
'!', '$' '?' '.' ',' etc. Also write a function to 
replace all odd occurance of '?' to '.'. 

3. there was a given program to insert a value at the 
proper postion in a doubly linked list. there was some 
logical error in that due to which it was not working 
properly. find out that error. it was easy. 





Sapient test 2nd round 

This is also technical round .Duration 1hr 
.
You have to write two programs .in any language .preferably c++ and java.

Program 1.
Name : Post - mails
Some conditions are given like if you cover some distance you have to pay this amount , if postal weight is this then u have to pay this amount .
Thus five to six conditions are given , you have to write the program to get the distance of post – mail / sort / print / the result .
Very simple program just use if and else loop .
Given : getdistance() is function which gives you the distance between two cities.

Program 2 
Name : compress and decompress the string .

One string is given like : aaabbbbbcddddeeee 
You hav to compress the string like a3b5c1d4e4

And it may happen while transferring the compress string some non alphanumeric characters can add in compressed string so compressed string can become a@3b%5c*1d$4e4 like this you have to remove this extra characters.

Those who cleared this test hav technical interview round

Technical interview : 
50 minutes technical interview .
10 min:Debugging
q1 .They had given me one program for debugging. The program is in java .and don’t hav any syntax error. Just logical error.

Written 
-------- 

1) Write a program for the problem: the array of 
inetegers indicating the marks of the students is 
given, U have to calculate the percentile of the 
students aaccording to this rule: the percentile of a 
student is the %of no of student having marks less 
then him. For eg: 
suppose 

Student Marks 
A 12 
B 60 
C 80 
D 71 
E 30 
F 45 


percentile of C = 5/5 *100 = 100 (out of 5 students 5 
are having marks less then him) 

percentile of B = 3/5*100 = 60% (out of 5, 3 have 
markses less then him) 

percentile of A = 0/5*100 = 0%. 

2) The code was given for a problem and u have to 
identitfy the logical error in it. That was simple. 
The code was to merge the Danagrams of 2 words. The 
danagram of a word is the letters of word arranfed in 
sequential order. eg danagram of abhinav is aabhinv. 
merging of danamagram is to merge the danagrams of 2 
or more words such that the highest no of occurance 
are coming for each alphabet.eg 

merging of aabhinv and abbhhixz is aabbhhinvxz.
