<p>The following letter from a reader and Fred Langa's comments appeared in the Plus (paid) edition of the
Langa list on July 14, 2003:</p>
<p><b>How To Keep The Kids From Messing Up Your PC</b></p>

<blockquote><p>
<font face="Courier New" size="2">
Hi Fred: My kids have contaminated my computer with their games, downloads and other junk like
Spyware on every partition (They like a fast machine.) I've had enough!
I need a solution to keep them within one partition and preferably hide the other partitions.
Computer is dual boot FAT 32 with internet sharing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C=win98se for testing purposes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D=XPpro
<br>
The other partitions carry the applications.
Looking forward to your next newsletter. ---Con Deka

<p>Win98 is not secure, and cannot be made so. There are cosmetic things you can do, but anyone on a Win98 machine can easily muck up the entire machine, if they're not careful (kids) or if they're malicious (crackers).<br>
<br>
I suggest you use XP for the whole thing; set up limited-privilege guest accounts for the kids; turn off file sharing; and follow the advice in the XP help file on guest accounts and shared systems. Once set up this way, the kids can have safe areas in which to play, and they won't be able to do much, if anything, to damage your areas or the system as a whole.

<p>Having just set up an XP computer for shared use between parents and
children, I wrote to Mr. Langa about this and he published my letter in the August 18, 2003
Plus issue of the newsletter:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Plus! Edition Extra: More On "Kid-Proofing" A PC</b></p>

<p>In item #13 in <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.langalist.com/plus/newsletters/2003/2003-07-14plus.asp  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.langalist.com/plus/newsletters/2003/2003-07-14plus.asp'" tppabs="http://www.langalist.com/plus/newsletters/2003/2003-07-14plus.asp"> http://www.langalist.com/plus/newsletters/2003/2003-07-14plus.asp</a>, we discussed ways of making your PC kid-proof by
using XP's (or Win2k's) "Guest" accounts, which are intended for just that purpose---letting people use a PC without being able to do much harm to it.</p>

<p>But no solution is perfect. For example, the very restrictions that make guest accounts safe also limits their usefulness. So, reader Michael
Horowitz suggests another approach:</p> 
 
<blockquote> <font face="Courier New" size="2">

     Fred, I just spent days setting up an XP machine for multiple users for the same reason and it's not worth the trouble. The
restricted kids accounts are sometimes too restricted. For example, they can't change their power profiles in the control
panel. So you have to make the kids admin class users, log on as them, change the power settings, log off, log on as an
admin user and make the kids restricted users again. On top of this, I've had problems with old software not designed for XP,
not running well under a restricted userid, but working under an admin class userid.<br>
<br>
     To a partitioning pro, I suggest two copies of XP, one for the adults and one for the kids. The kids copy of XP can be made
to boot up with a default user id, no password prompt and no userlist screen. The adults copy of XP can be secured by the
usual userid/password. If each copy of XP is in a primary partition, pqboot from Partition Magic will shut down the
current copy of XP, hide its partition, unhide the partition of the other copy of XP and boot the other copy.
  All with a simple GUI interface.&nbsp;
</font>
  <p><font face="Courier New" size="2"> An extended partition can be used for sharing files, it will be seen by both copies of XP.
What you lose in disk space usage you more than make up in time and effort. The reader also mentioned they store
applications in different partition from the OS. This complicates my suggestion and I don't see the advantage to it,
even without this scheme in mind.  My 2 cents. --- Michael

<p> 
Thanks Michael! That way can work, and the end result--- one PC, one XP license, several users--- is the same whether you set up multiple<br>
accounts on one OS installation, or separate multiple installations of the OS. But my guess is that this "two separate installs of XP" may be a<br>
technical violation of the license, and may therefore not be ideal. </p> 

<p>I personally prefer the limited account option. Yes, it can be a minor hassle to have to switch accounts from time to time, but it's using the<br>
software in the way it was designed, and so may be a "cleaner" alternative.</p>

<h3><b>Updates</b></h3>

<p> September 29, 2003. I have tried, on a couple computers,
using restricted Windows XP accounts for children on a machine shared with
parents. Both were failures due to assorted software that fails to run correctly
as a restricted user. Mr. Langa's point about using the software the way it was
designed is valid for Windows. The problem is the millions of software programs
written before Windows XP introduced the concept of limited users. I have not
kept good records on the failing software, but a couple come to mind off the top
of my head.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most annoying was a USB based WiFi network adapter from D-Link. It
connected to the WiFi access point/router when logged on as an Admin class user,
but failed when logged on as a limited user. This happened for multiple admin
users and multiple limited users. My solution was to make all users Admin class
users.&nbsp;<br>
<b>Update</b>: A reader wrote to say that he too fought this battle and had to
set up users as members of the Power Users group. He was told by D-Link that
they always assume full administrator rights on their products.&nbsp; June 7,
2005.&nbsp;</p>
<p>CD Anywhere is software the makes virtual CD-ROM drives so you can run
programs off the hard disk that normally required a physical CD disc. Three
versions of the software all failed to work correctly under Windows XP (you can
read <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.computergripes.com/cdanywhere.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.computergripes.com/cdanywhere.html'" tppabs="http://www.computergripes.com/cdanywhere.html">detailed gripes</a>
on my other web site). One version produced error messages every time a limited
user logged on to Windows XP while it produced no errors when an Admin class
user logged on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Someone emailed me that under Windows XP you have to be an Administrative
user to get updated virus definitions with <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.computergripes.com/NortonAntiVirus2003.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.computergripes.com/NortonAntiVirus2003.html'" tppabs="http://www.computergripes.com/NortonAntiVirus2003.html"> Norton Anti-Virus 2003</a> and to run a

LiveUpdate requires the use of an Administrator account under Windows NT/2000/XP</a></p>
<p>The installation instructions for Jump Start Second Grade warn that although
it works under Windows XP, it has not been tested with limited userids.&nbsp;</p>
<p>April 18, 2004. I accidentally stumbled across the fact that some
configuration options for the ZoneAlarm firewall are tracked per user while
other options effect the entire computer (for all users). There is no way to
know if a particular setting applies to just the currently logged on user or the
entire computer, other than trial and error.&nbsp;</p>
<p>April 21, 2004. I accidentally stumbled across the fact that the free version
of MailWasher v2 (a great anti-spam program) which is only supposed to support a
single email account, actually supports a single email account per Windows XP
user.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

It's a very interesting read. One thing he mentions is that because shortcuts
are stored in the All Users account's desktop a limited user can't delete icons
off their desktop.</p>

<p>March 12, 2005. The anti-Spyware program SpySweeper from Webroot can only run with
Admin privileges (I have not confirmed this myself).&nbsp;</p>
