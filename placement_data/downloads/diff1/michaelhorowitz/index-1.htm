TimeKeeper is a web page that can be used to track hours/minutes spent working on a project.
The intended audience is someone who bills clients by the hour (consultants, lawyers,
etc.).&nbsp;
<p>It is a bit unusual in that the application consists entirely of JavaScript
embedded in the web page (cookies are the data store).&nbsp;</p>

<p> TimeKeeper is free. It requires only a web browser that supports JavaScript
and thus should be usable from pretty much any browser on pretty much any Operating System
(Windows, Mac,
Linux, etc.).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>TimeKeeper can be used either on-line or off-line. That is, you can use it
from this web site while
logged on to the Internet or, better yet, download it to your computer and use
it in off-line mode at any time. Although it is a web page, TimeKeeper was designed
and intended for off-line use. The <a href="timekeeper.online.html" tppabs="http://www.michaelhorowitz.com/Timekeeper/timekeeper.online.html">on-line
use</a> available here is intended only as a demonstration (but
it is fully functional). To use it off-line, you have to download the single TimeKeeper
web page to your computer (instructions are below).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The application is brutally simple, using it involves nothing more than clicking on buttons on a web page. One button tells
it when you start working for the day, another tells it when you stop working
for the day. In between, you can suspend working and resume working any number
of times. <a href="Usage.Notes.html" tppabs="http://www.michaelhorowitz.com/Timekeeper/Usage.Notes.html">(see usage notes)</a>
 All TimeKeeper does is add up all the minutes/hours you worked and report on
it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Your web browser does not have to be active or running TimeKeeper while you are working. After you
tell TimeKeeper that you have started or resumed a work day, you can close your web browser. TimeKeeper saves the
information it needs in a cookie, which is
read later when you suspend your work session or end the work day. The advantages of leaving TimeKeeper
running while you are working are that it makes it harder to forget about TimeKeeper when you stop working
and you can use the reminders feature.</p>

<p>A short introduction to using TimeKeeper is included with the off-line
version and available from the Help button. A longer discussion of all the ins and out of using TimeKeeper,
is available on the <a href="Usage.Notes.html" tppabs="http://www.michaelhorowitz.com/Timekeeper/Usage.Notes.html">Usage Notes</a> page.&nbsp; </p>

<p> Cookies are small text files that are read and
written by a web browser program. TimeKeeper's use of cookies is
unusual in that it does not require a web server. Instead, TimeKeeper issues
JavaScript commands to your web browser to read and write the cookies it needs. This is what enables
TimeKeeper to be used off-line. </p>

<p>Why use cookies? Originally JavaScript was intended for use within a web browser and for security reasons was not
allowed to read or write to files or databases. This has changed over time, ASP on the server side and WSH on
the client side now allow JavaScript programs to access files and databases. Cookies
have always been allowed from client-side JavaScript and they are a safe means
of data storage. They are plain text files and by restricting itself to cookies,
TimeKeeper can not read any data on your computer. If you have any security
concerns about TimeKeeper, just look at the source code of the web page.&nbsp; </p>

<h4><b>Can you run TimeKeeper?&nbsp;</b></h4>

<font face="Verdana" size="2">

As noted above, TimeKeeper requires JavaScript which is built into almost every web browser.
However, even if your web browser supports JavaScript, the use of JavaScript might be disabled.
Below is a test of whether your web browser
both supports
JavaScript and is enabled to use it. There are many versions
of JavaScript and the test shows the version used in your web browser.
TimeKeeper <i> should</i> work with all versions of JavaScript as I avoided any
recent (meaning nothing new as of 2001) or fancy language features. However, I have not tested it with each
and every web browser.&nbsp;Your test results:&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>Pretty much every web browser supports JavaScript. The most popular ones,
Internet Explorer, Mozilla, Firefox, Opera, Netscape (v4, 6 and 7) all do. To check if a particular browser
supports JavaScript, see this chart from <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://hotwired.lycos.com/webmonkey/reference/browser_chart/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://hotwired.lycos.com/webmonkey/reference/browser_chart/'" tppabs="http://hotwired.lycos.com/webmonkey/reference/browser_chart/">WebMonkey</a>.</p>

<h4><b>Get the Off-Line Version</b></h4>

<font face="Verdana" size="2">

<p>To use TimeKeeper off-line, you have to download a single <font face="Courier New"> html</font> file to
your computer. The <a href="Download.html" tppabs="http://www.michaelhorowitz.com/Timekeeper/Download.html">download</a> page has instructions on
this and also shows the date of the latest version of TimeKeeper (I track
updates based on dates, not versions/releases). The off-line version reports
it's last update date at the bottom of the web page.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>To help you decide whether to upgrade to the latest version of TimeKeeper, see
the changes made on the <a href="Change.History.html" tppabs="http://www.michaelhorowitz.com/Timekeeper/Change.History.html">change history</a> page.</p>
