Gazette Reader Sherrie R. writes:<I> <P>&quot; Hi Dennis,</p> <P>I am currently using Windows 2000 and Outlook Express. Sometimes when I receive an email, I see a lightly outlined small box with a red X in the center where a picture should appear. The red X also appears (but less frequently) with some web sites I visit. Why does this happen? Many of my friends report this has happened to them too, but they don't know why either. I would appreciate any and all help/advice you can give. &quot;</p> </I> <P><B>My response</B>:</P> <P>There are a number of reasons why a red X may appear on your screen, and is not necessarily a problem with Outlook Express or Internet Explorer.</p> <P>Here are a few possibilities:</p> <ol> <li>The page or email you are viewing contains text (which is often cached or saved to your hard drive); however, the picture file(s) contained in the page is/are probably referenced via a web site (which requires an Internet connection). If you are offline, the red X will appear.<br> &nbsp;</li> <li>The page (or email) you are viewing contains a picture which is in fact hosted on a secondary web site, and that web site is offline. If picture cannot be referenced, the red X will appear.<br> &nbsp;</li> <li>There may be a temporary problem connecting to the web site which hosts the picture.<br> &nbsp;</li> <li>The web site hosting the picture file may have been blocked by your firewall, ad-blocking software, or Hosts file.<br> &nbsp;</li> <li>The reference to the picture is no longer valid, producing a red X, because the picture has been moved or deleted from the remote host (web site).<br> &nbsp;</li> <li>Your Internet Explorer security settings are not permitting you to access the web site which hosts the picture file. Try changing your settings to default (Tools -&gt; Internet Options -&gt; Security -&gt; Default).</li> </ol> <P>If on the other hand, you have problems sending pictures using Outlook Express (an entirely different problem, although related to the &quot;red X&quot;), please refer to this article:</p> <P> <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.infopackets.com/channels/en/windows/gazette/2002/20021017_the_box_with_a_red_x_missing_pictures_in_outlook_express_part_2.htm  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.infopackets.com/channels/en/windows/gazette/2002/20021017_the_box_with_a_red_x_missing_pictures_in_outlook_express_part_2.htm'" tppabs="http://www.infopackets.com/channels/en/windows/gazette/2002/20021017_the_box_with_a_red_x_missing_pictures_in_outlook_express_part_2.htm"> The box with a Red X -- Missing pictures in Outlook Express, Part 2</a></p> <P>Hope that helps!

<p>Most CD burning applications are loaded with tons of techno-jargon that 
confuse most computer users (let alone, newbies). And with a plethora of CD 
formats, creating a CD -- whether it's an audio CD for your car, or a data CD

there's a much easier solution (and you don't need to be a rocket scientist to 
use it)!</p>
