	<li>Please give a regular expression (preferably Perl/PREG style), which can be used to identify the URL from within a HTML link tag. Example: The regular expression should match the tag &lt;A HREF=&#8221;http://www.yoursite.com/&#8221;&gt; and give the URL (&#8221;http://www.yoursite.com /&#8221;) as a return result.

Please create the SQL statements for creating the necessary table(s) for storing the invoices in a MySQL database. An invoice should hold information like invoice number, customer, date, article(s) and quantity etc.</li>
	<li>For the database from the previous question, please give an SQL query which returns the invoice number of all invoices which contain the article with the number &#8220;1234&#8243;. The query should be able to run under a MySQL 4.0 database.</li>

On submission, the form should be redisplayed (while remaining all options/inputs as the user has selected/entered them). Additionally, the selections/inputs of the user should be displayed in text.

	<p>This command will repair the table specified<br />
if the quick is given the mysql will do a repair of only the index tree if the extended is given it will create index row by row

		<p>Give the syntax of Grant and Revoke commands?<br />
The generic syntax for grant is as following<br />
&gt; GRANT [rights] on [database/s] TO [username@hostname] IDENTIFIED BY [password]<br />
now rights can be<br />
a) All privilages<br />
b) combination of create, drop, select, insert, update and delete etc.<br />
we can grant rights on all databse by usingh *.* or some specific database by database.* or a specific table by database.table_name<br />
<a href="mailto:username@hotsname">username@hotsname</a> can be  either <a href="mailto:username@localhost">username@localhost</a>, <a href="mailto:username@hostname">username@hostname</a> and <a href="mailto:username@%">username@%</a><br />
where hostname is any valid hostname and % represents any name, the *.* any condition<br />
password is simply the password of user</p>
	<p>The generic syntax for revoke is as following<br />
&gt; REVOKE [rights] on [database/s] FROM [username@hostname]<br />
now rights can be as explained above<br />
a) All privilages<br />
b) combination of create, drop, select, insert, update and delete etc.</p>
	<p><a href="mailto:username@hotsname">username@hotsname</a> can be  either <a href="mailto:username@localhost">username@localhost</a>, <a href="mailto:username@hostname">username@hostname</a> and <a href="mailto:username@%">username@%</a><br />

		<p>What is the difference between char and varchar data types?<br />
Set char to occupy n bytes and it will take n bytes even if u r storing avalue of n-m butes<br />
Set varchar to occupy n bytes and it will take only the required space and will not use the n bytes<br />
eg. name char(10) will waste 5 bytes if we store &#8216;kumar&#8217;, if each char takes a byte<br />
eg. name varchar(10) will just use 5 bytes if we store &#8216;kumar&#8217;, if each char takes a byte. rest 5 bytes will be free.

	<p>Mr. Kumar has given its answer but if you have used mysql as backend and if you fire a query &#8220;delete from tablename&#8221; then in mysql it will reset auto index. so for condition one it will start from value 1. </p>
