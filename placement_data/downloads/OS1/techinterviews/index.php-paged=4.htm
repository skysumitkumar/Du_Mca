	<ol>
<li><b>Explain the .NET architecture.</b></li>
	<li><b>How many languages .NET is supporting now?</b> - When .NET was introduced it came with several languages. VB.NET, C#, COBOL and Perl, etc. The site DotNetLanguages.Net <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.dotnetlanguages.net/DNL/Resources.aspx  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.dotnetlanguages.net/DNL/Resources.aspx'" tppabs="http://www.dotnetlanguages.net/DNL/Resources.aspx">says 44 languages are supported</a>.</li>
	<li><b>How is .NET able to support multiple languages?</b> - a language should comply with the Common Language Runtime standard to become a .NET language. In .NET, code is compiled to Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL for short). This is called as Managed Code. This Managed code is run in .NET environment. So after compilation to this IL the language is not a barrier. A code can call or use a function written in another language.</li>
