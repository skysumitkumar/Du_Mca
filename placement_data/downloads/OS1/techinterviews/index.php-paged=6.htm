<li>What is normalization? -  Well a relational database is basically composed of tables that contain related data. So the Process of organizing this data into tables is actually referred to as normalization. </li>

			<p>And guide on how to answer them. Forwarded to me by recruiter who swore she uses this guide.</p>
	<ol>
<li><b>Tell me about yourself:</b> - The most often asked question in interviews. You need to have a short statement prepared in your mind. Be careful that it does not sound rehearsed. Limit it to work-related items unless instructed otherwise. Talk about things you have done and jobs you have held that relate to the position you are interviewing for. Start with the item farthest back and work up to the present. </li>
	<li><b>Why did you leave your last job?</b> - Stay positive regardless of the circumstances. Never refer to a major problem with management and never speak ill of supervisors, co-workers or the organization. If you do, you will be the one looking bad. Keep smiling and talk about leaving for a positive reason such as an opportunity, a chance to do something special or other forward-looking reasons. </li>

	<ol>
<li><b> Is it possible to inline assembly or IL in C# code? </b> - No. </li>
	<li><b> Is it possible to have different access modifiers on the get/set methods of a property? </b> - No. The access modifier on a property applies to both its get and set accessors. What you need to do if you want them to be different is make the property read-only (by only providing a get accessor) and create a private/internal set method that is separate from the property. </li>

<li><b> Are private class-level variables inherited? </b> - Yes, but they are not accessible, so looking at it you can honestly say that they are not inherited. But they are. </li>
	<li><b> Why does DllImport not work for me? </b> - All methods marked with the DllImport attribute must be marked as public static extern. </li>

<li><b> Can we use the constructor, instead of init(), to initialize servlet? </b> - Yes , of course you can use the constructor instead of init(). There&#8217;s nothing to stop you. But you shouldn&#8217;t. The original reason for init() was that ancient versions of Java couldn&#8217;t dynamically invoke constructors with arguments, so there was no way to give the constructur a ServletConfig. That no longer applies, but servlet containers still will only call your no-arg constructor. So you won&#8217;t have access to a ServletConfig or ServletContext.</li>
	<li><b> How can a servlet refresh automatically if some new data has entered the database? </b> - You can use a client-side Refresh or Server Push.</li>

			<ol>
<li><b>Is is possible for an EJB client to marshal an object of class java.lang.Class to an EJB?</b> - Technically yes, spec. compliant NO! - The enterprise bean must not attempt to query a class to obtain information about the declared members that are not otherwise accessible to the enterprise bean because of the security rules of the Java language.</li>
	<li><b>Is it legal to have static initializer blocks in EJB?</b> - Although technically it is legal, static initializer blocks are used to execute some piece of code before executing any constructor or method while instantiating a class. Static initializer blocks are also typically used to initialize static fields - which may be illegal in EJB if they are read/write - In EJB this can be achieved by including the code in either the ejbCreate(), setSessionContext() or setEntityContext() methods.</li>
