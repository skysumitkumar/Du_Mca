			<p>A reader went through an interview at eBay and shared the questions asked.</p>
	<ol>
<li>Let&#8217;s say you have 100,000 records and you want to delete 95,000 at a time and keep only 5 thousand. But in local memory you don&#8217;t have enough space for 95,000 records. What do you do in this case? How do you delete without any problem with time and performance?</li>
	<li>I need data on eBay customers in Chicago who can did bid on certain item? I dont have access to eBay database directly. How I get the information?</li>
	<li>With DTS packaging I can store tables in Excel and convert them back to SQL. But once I copied tables to Excel I want to modify some info. How you do that without editing the Excel file?</li>
	<li>What is cursor and where do you use them?</li>
</ol>

Its basically like a Macro so when you invoke the Stored procedure, you actually run a set of statements. </li>

<li><b> Can we use the constructor, instead of init(), to initialize servlet? </b> - Yes , of course you can use the constructor instead of init(). There&#8217;s nothing to stop you. But you shouldn&#8217;t. The original reason for init() was that ancient versions of Java couldn&#8217;t dynamically invoke constructors with arguments, so there was no way to give the constructur a ServletConfig. That no longer applies, but servlet containers still will only call your no-arg constructor. So you won&#8217;t have access to a ServletConfig or ServletContext.</li>
	<li><b> How can a servlet refresh automatically if some new data has entered the database? </b> - You can use a client-side Refresh or Server Push.</li>
