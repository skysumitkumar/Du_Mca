	<li><b>What are the steps involved in establishing a JDBC connection?</b> This action involves two steps: loading the JDBC driver and making the connection.</li>
	<li><b>How can you load the drivers?</b><br />
Loading the driver or drivers you want to use is very simple and involves just one line of code. If, for example, you want to use the JDBC-ODBC Bridge driver, the following code will load it:</p>
	<blockquote><p>
Class.forName(&#8221;sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver&#8221;);
</p></blockquote>
	<p>Your driver documentation will give you the class name to use. For instance, if the class name is jdbc.DriverXYZ, you would load the driver with the following line of code:</p>
	<blockquote><p>
Class.forName(&#8221;jdbc.DriverXYZ&#8221;);
</p></blockquote>

<li><b>Explain the difference between a hot backup and a cold backup and the benefits associated with each.</b> - A hot backup is basically taking a backup of the database while it is still up and running and it must be in archive log mode. A cold backup is taking a backup of the database while it is shut down and does not require being in archive log mode. The benefit of taking a hot backup is that the database is still available for use while the backup is occurring and you can recover the database to any point in time. The benefit of taking a cold backup is that it is typically easier to administer the backup and recovery process. In addition, since you are taking cold backups the database does not require being in archive log mode and thus there will be a slight performance gain as the database is not cutting archive logs to disk.</li>
