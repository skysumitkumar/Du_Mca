Let $F$ be a text file consisting of $128$ characters, each in the set
$A=\{ a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h \}$, and let $T$ be a Huffman encoding
trie for~$F$.  The height of $T$ depends on the frequencies the
characters of $A$ in~$F$ (the frequency of a character is the number
of occurrences of that character in the file).
\begin{enumerate}
\item  Assign a frequency to each character of $A$ such that the height
  of $T$ is {\em maximum}.
\item  Assign a frequency to each character of $A$ such that the height
  of $T$ is {\em minimum}.
\end{enumerate}
In each case, draw $T$ and determine the length (number of bits) of
the encoded file.  Note that in each case, the sum of the frequencies
of the characters must be~$128$.
