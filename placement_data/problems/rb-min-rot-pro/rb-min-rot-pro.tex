Suppose we build a red-black tree by inserting $N$ keys into an
initially empty red-black tree.  How many restructurings (single or
double rotations) are performed overall in the best-case and
worst-case, respectively?  Use the Oh-notation. You don't have to give
give exact expressions. ({\em Hint:} what affects the height of the
tree?)
