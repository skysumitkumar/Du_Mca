Consider a set of points with no three collinear points.  Describe an
efficient data structure that supports the following query operation:
%
\begin{quote}

Given a point $p$ not on the convex hull, return three points on the
convex hull that form a triangle containing $p$.

\end{quote}
%
What is the space requirement and query time for your data structure?
Assume that the points on the convex hull are given as part of the
input.  It's OK if your algorithm does not handle special cases (e.g.,
triplets of collinear points).
