One night Roberto was walking home from the CIT when he was attacked by
a dog.  Luckily, the dog was satisfied with biting only Roberto's
notebook \ldots  The next day Roberto tries to figure out what was the
algorithm that he had written on one badly damaged page of the
notebook.  Here's what the page looks like:

Your task is to figure out what is the algorithm described by the
above pseudocode.

\begin{enumerate}

\item    (40\%  credit) What is the set of edges $S$ returned by the
algorithm?

\item    (40\%  credit) What is the time complexity of the algorithm?

\item    (20\%  credit) Give an example of a practical problem that can be
solved by applying the algorithm.

\end{enumerate}
