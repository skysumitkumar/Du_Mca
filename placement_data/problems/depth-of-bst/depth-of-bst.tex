\begin{enumerate}

\item  The depth of a binary-search-tree of $n$ nodes can be anywhere  
between $(\approx  \log  n)$ to $(n-1)$. You're going to demonstrate
this to us by solving this problem.

Draw binary search trees of height 2,3,4,5 and 6 on the set of keys
\{1,4,5,10,16,17,21\}. 

\item  You are given an array $A$ of size $n$. Suppose the following
algorithm was used to print out the elements of $A$ in sorted order.

\begin{enumerate}
\item  Initialize $B \leftarrow$  Empty Binary Search Tree.
\item  for $i$ $\leftarrow$  1 to $n$
\item  ~~~~Insert $A[i]$ into $B$
\item  Print out the elements in an in-order traversal of $B$
\end{enumerate}

Give an upper bound on the time complexity of the above
algorithm. Note that you cannot assume that the procedure to insert
into the search tree does any height balancing.

\end{enumerate}
