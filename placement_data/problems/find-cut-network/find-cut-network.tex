Brown's computer network is a connected graph whose vertices are
computers and whose edges are communication links.  A link is said to
be {\em critical} if its failure causes some computers to become
unreachable by some other computers, i.e., if its removal disconnects
the graph.  Give an efficient algorithm that finds all the critical links.
