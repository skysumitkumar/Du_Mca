With very brief reasons, state whether the following statements are
true or false.

\begin{enumerate}
\item  The best case running time of Bubble Sort if $O(n)$.
\item  The best case running time of Merge Sort is $O(n)$.
\item  Quick Sort is stable. Remember that a {\em stable sort}
preserves the original order of equal keys in the sequence.
\item  Selection sort is stable.
\item  The worse case complexity of Quick Sort is $O(n^2)$.
\end{enumerate}
