You are implementing an algorithm that draws part of the landscape of a
terrain, and you are faced with the following problem: You are given
the heights of $N$  points of the terrain's grid, and you need to find
and sort, as fast as possible, the $\sqrt  N$ highest of them. Give an
algorithm that does this, and argue that no one can do better (up to a
constant factor, of course!) ({\em Hint:} Your algorithm should run in
$O(N)$ time; there is a simple argument why this is the best
possible.)
