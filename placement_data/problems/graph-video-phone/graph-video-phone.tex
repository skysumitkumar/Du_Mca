RT\&T  has a network of $N$ switching stations connected by $M$
high-speed communication links.  Each customer's phone is directly
connected to one station in his/her area.  The engineers of RT\&T  have
developed a prototype video-phone system that allows two customers to
see each other during the phone call.  In order to have acceptable
image quality, the number of links used to transmit video signals
between the two parties cannot exceed~4.  Suppose that RT\&T's  network
is represented by a graph  Design an efficient algorithm that computes,
for each station, the set of stations it can reach using no more than 4
links
