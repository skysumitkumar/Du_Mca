The number of irrelevant posts per day on the brown.cs.cs016 newsgroup
reached a new high when the Brown newsgroup police decided to do
something. They decided to take ``action'' against all people who had
more than $x$ posts totally. They have all the input and want to do
this real fast since they have had enough of work and want to go home
and sleep. The action that they plan to take also depends on the
number of offenders. If the number of offenders is large, then they
will take severe action against each of them, otherwise the action
taken will be mild. So, they first have to find the number of
offenders.

As an input they are given an array $A$ of $n$ unsorted integers where
$A[i]$ contains the number of posts by student $i$. Design an $O(\log
n)$ time PRAM algorithm to determine the number of elements in $A$
which are greater than $x$. Specify the number of processors required
as well as the PRAM model used.  Your algorithm may use auxiliary
space.
