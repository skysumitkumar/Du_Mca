In this question, we will compare the merge-sort and quick-sort
algorithms under different circumstances.
You have to sort a set of $n$ numbers in an application.
\begin{enumerate}
\item  The application is such that one should be able to guarantee
that the algorithm executes within a certain time ($T$, say) and of
course, the lesser the value of $T$ that the algorithm can guarantee,
the better suited it is for the application. The correctness of the
application depends upon the guarantee being obeyed. Which algorithm
would you choose for this, merge-sort or quick-sort?

\item  The application is such that it can tolerate an occasional case
when the algorithm takes a lot of time, but the algorithm should be
fast ``most'' of the time. Which algorithm among merge-sort and
quick-sort would you choose for this?
\end{enumerate}
