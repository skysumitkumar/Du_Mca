Suppose a group of men and women subscribe to {\em Dates Are Us}, a
dating service.  Each subscriber has provided personal information to
help determine compatibility.  In addition, following consideration of
the personal data of the other subscribers, each subscriber submits a set
of {\em candidates}, i.e., the people he or she is willing to date. 

{\it A date between $\alpha$ and $\omega$ can be arranged if and only

if $\alpha$ is candidate for $\omega$, and $\omega$ is a candidate for

$\alpha$.}

If {\em Dates Are Us} successfully arranges a date, it collects \$100
from both of the involved parties.  Given the restriction that a
member can date exactly one of his or her candidates, each of whom is
of the opposite sex, how can the dating service make the most money?

Note: The above restrictions are imposed to make the problem simpler
to solve, and are in no way meant to be discriminatory.
