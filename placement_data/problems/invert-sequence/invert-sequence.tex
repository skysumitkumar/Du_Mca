{\large\bfseries\itshape Invert a Sequence.} 
Consider a sequence $S$ that provides the following methods:
\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\tt insertFirst}$(e)$ inserts element $e$ into the first
  position of $S$ and returns a locator to the newly inserted element.
  
\item[] {\tt remove}($l$) removes the element with locator $l$ from
  $S$ and returns it.
  
\item[] {\tt first}$()$ returns a locator to the first element of $S$.
  
\item[] {\tt last}$()$ returns a locator to the last element of $S$.
  
\item[] {\tt size}$()$ returns the number of elements of $S$.

\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\item  Provide a new method {\tt invert()} that inverts the order of
  the elements in the sequence and accesses the sequence {\it only}
  through the above methods.
  

\item  Can you perform {\tt invert()} without using method {\tt last()}
  given to you?
\end{enumerate}

Note that {\tt invert()} does not return a new sequence but rearranges
the elements of the current sequence.  You can use temporary sequences
for auxiliary storage in order to perform this operation.
