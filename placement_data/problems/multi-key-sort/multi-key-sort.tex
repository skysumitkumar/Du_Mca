Entries in a phone book have {\em multiple} keys: last name, first
name, address, and telephone number.  They are sorted first by last
name, then by first name, and finally by address.  Design a variation
of radix sort for sorting the entries in a phone book, assuming that
you have available a procedure that sorts records on a {\em single}
key.
