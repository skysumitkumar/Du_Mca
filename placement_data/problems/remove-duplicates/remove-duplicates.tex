AB-CD, a company that sells audio CDs, wants to offer for free to its
customers the latest CD of MammaDonna, a hit singer of the 90's. It
wants, however, to give only one CD per household.  Members of the same
household are defined as those that share the same address.  AB-CD
keeps the records of its $N$ customers in an unsorted linked list,
where each element contains a name and an address.  Thus, AB-CD decides
to prune the customer list such that only one customer per address is
kept, i.e., every household appears only once.

Describe an efficient algorithm, in pseudocode or English, to prune
AB-CD's customer list.  Make sure that you are doing better than the
naive, inefficient, $O(N^2)$ method that compares every possible pair
of records.
