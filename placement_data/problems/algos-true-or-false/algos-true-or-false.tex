Explain briefly whether the following statements are true or false. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item  In a heap, the heights of the left and right subtrees of a node
differ by atmost 1.  
% \item  In a heap represented in an array, the smallest element can in
% the first half of the array. (Assume that all the elements in the
% array are distinct)
\item  The best case running time of Bubble Sort is $O(n)$.
\item  The best case running time of Merge Sort is $O(n)$.
\item  The worst case complexity of Quick Sort is $O(n^2)$.
\item  The worst case complexity of AVL Tree insertion is $O(n)$.
\end{enumerate}
