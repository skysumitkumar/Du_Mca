To reduce costs, a mail-order company wants to remove duplicates from
its large mailing list.  Give an efficient
algorithm to perform this task.  Assume that the mailing list is stored
as an unsorted linked list, where each element contains a name and
an address.

Describe your algorithm in English or pseudocode, mention any
additional data structure used, and analyze the time complexity.  You
should do better than the obvious and inefficient $O(N^2)$-time
algorithm that checks all the possible pairs of elements.
