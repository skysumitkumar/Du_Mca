A team of biologists keeps information about DNA structures in an AVL
tree using as key the specific weight (an integer) of the structure.
The biologists routinely ask questions of the type
%
\begin{quote}
``Are there any structures in the tree with specific weight between $a$
and $b$ (inclusive)?''
\end{quote}
%
and they hope to get an answer as soon as possible.

Design an efficient algorithm that given integers $a$ and $b$, returns
true if there exists a key $x$ in the tree such that $a \le  x \le  b$,
and false if no such key exists in the tree.  Describe your algorithm
in pseudocode or English. What is the time complexity of your
algorithm?
