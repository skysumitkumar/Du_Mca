Let graph $G=(V,E)$ be given and let $R$ be a relation on $E$. For 
$e_{1},e_{2} \in  E$, assume that $(e_{1},e_{2}) \in  R$ if and only if 
$e_{1}=e_{2}$ or
there is a cycle in $G$ which contains $e_{1}$ and $e_{2}$.  Prove that
$R$ is an equivalence relation on $E$.  Also, show that the equivalence
classes which $R$ defines are the biconnected components of $G$.
