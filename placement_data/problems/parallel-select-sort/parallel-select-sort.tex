Let $A$ be an array of $N$ unsorted integers.  Suppose, in addition,
that you are given a single integer $x$.  

\begin{enumerate}

\item

Design an $O(\log  N)$ time PRAM algorithm to determine the {\em rank}
of $x$ in $A$ (i.e. the number of elements of $A$ which are less than
or equal to $x$).  Specify the number of processors required as well as
the PRAM model used.

\item

How can you apply the above algorithm to derive a parallel version of
selection sort using $N^2$ processors? (Describe the algorithm in
English.) What is the time complexity of your algorithm?

\end{enumerate}
