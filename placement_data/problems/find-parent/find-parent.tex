The students at Tamarindo University are being harassed by electronic
chain letters and the FBI wants to trace who has started the infamous
game.  The FBI has obtained from the system administrators the
sender/receiver information for all the chain emails.  By viewing the
sender as the ``parent'' and the receiver as the ``child'' they have
built trees to represent the propagation of chain letters (Assume for
simplicity that there are no cycles in the graph thus
constructed). The originators are the roots of such trees. FBI has
decided that each person who received an electronic chain letter
should get a compensation from the originator of that chain (i.e the
root of the tree to which the person belongs). Assume that each person
is in only one tree.

Let $\cal  F$ be a forest, i.e., a set of rooted trees.  Assume that
for each node $v$ contained in some tree of $\cal  F$, we know only
$p(v)$, the parent of $v$.  Given this, design a CREW PRAM algorithm
that computes the root of the tree containing $v$, for each node $v$
in the forest.  Your algorithm should run in $O(\log  H)$ time, where
$H$ is the height of the tallest tree in $\cal  F$.  Your algorithm
need not be optimal in terms of the number of processors used, but
specify the number of processors required by your algorithm.
