Professor Fermat has the policy of giving A's to the top $\sqrt{n}$
students of his class, where $n$ is the number of students.  The
algorithm that he uses to determine the top $\sqrt{n}$ students first
sorts the list of students by their numerical grade, and then picks the
top $\sqrt{n}$ students from the sorted list. This algorithm has
time-complexity $O(n\log  n)$.  Can you suggest a more efficient
algorithm that has time-complexity $O(n)$?  Describe your algorithm
informally in English and justify its time-complexity.
