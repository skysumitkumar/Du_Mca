Let $T$ be a rooted tree such that all the leaves have the same depth
$d$, and all the internal nodes have exactly $b$ children, and let $r$
be the root of~$T$.  Consider $T$ as a graph, and represent it with
adjacency lists, where the edge to the parent of a node follows the
edges to the children.  If we perform depth-first search on $T$ with a
nonrecursive procedure starting at vertex $r$, what will be the maximum
size of the stack during the computation?   And what about
breadth-first search? Use $O$ or $\Theta$  notation.
