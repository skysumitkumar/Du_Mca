The United Nations has $N$ aircraft stationed at bases around the
world, which perform relief missions consisting of delivering
supplies.  For each such aircraft, there is a set of {\em reachable

locations}, determined by the aircraft's base.  Also, each aircraft can
perform at most one mission per day.

Each morning the U.N.\  leaders examine the set of $M$ locations that
have requested supplies, and assign each aircraft to a relief mission
into a specific location.

\begin{enumerate}

\item  Give an algorithm that allows the maximum number of
requests to be fulfilled.

\item  What is the time complexity of your algorithm?

\end{enumerate}
