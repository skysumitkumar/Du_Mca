A team of scientists is designing a control system to monitor the
reactor in a nuclear energy plant.  They need to find the maximum of
$N$ integer readings very fast, so that the system can immediately
trigger appropriate procedures.

The scientists took CS~16 and know that the maximum of $N$ elements
can be computed in $O(1)$ time using a CRCW PRAM with $N^{2}$
processors.  However, they have a limited budget that allows them to
purchase only $N^{3/2}$ processors.

Design a CRCW PRAM algorithm that computes the maximum of $N$ elements
in $O(1)$ time using $N^{3/2}$ processors.
