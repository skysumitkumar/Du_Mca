In order to provide cellular phone service, RT\&T  has set up $N$
transmission stations, such that a mobile customer is served by the
station currently closest to her.  Therefore, we can define $N$
geographic regions, each served by a distinct station.

\begin{enumerate}

\item  Which geometric construction gives the above partition into regions?

\item  Draw the regions for the stations shown in the figure below,
where each station is represented by a point in the plane.

\end{enumerate}
