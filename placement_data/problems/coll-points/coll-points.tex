Give an algorithm which determines whether any three points in a set
of $n$ points are collinear. Your algorithm should execute in
$O(n^2\log  n)$ time. Assume that the points are all distinct.

You are given a function {\em MakesGreaterAngle} which takes an input
an origin and 2 other points and determines which of these two points
make a greater angle with the horizontal (which has been fixed).
