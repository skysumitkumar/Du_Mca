Let $A$ be an array of $n$ unsorted integers.  Suppose, in addition,
that you are given a single integer $x$.
Design an $O(\log  n)$ time PRAM algorithm to determine the {\em rank} of
$x$ in $A$ (i.e. the number of elements of $A$ which are less than or equal
to $x$).  Specify the number of processors required as well as the PRAM
model used.  Hint:  Compare $x$ to all elements of $A$ and store the results
in an auxiliary array.  Then invoke the prefix sums algorithm presented in
Homework 10.
