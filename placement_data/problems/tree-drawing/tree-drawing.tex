Consider the tree drawing method covered in class (slide 40).

\begin{enumerate}

\item  Let $x(v)$ be the {\em pre-order} rank of $v$ (rather than the in-order
      rank of $v$), and draw the tree in slide 40 accordingly.

\item  Draw the tree if $x(v)$ is the {\em post-order} rank of $v$.

\item  Let $T$ be any binary tree.  Show that if $x(v)$ is the pre-order rank
      of $v$ and $y(v)$ is the depth of $v$, for all nodes $v$ of T,
      then the resulting drawing of $T$ has no edges crossings.

\end{enumerate}
