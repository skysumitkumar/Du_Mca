You are given a sequence of $n$ integers realized as a doubly-linked
list.  Give an $O(\log  n)$-time CREW PRAM algorithm that uses $n$
processors and determines, for each element in the sequence, the
largest element with smaller or equal rank.  Assume that at the
beginning of the algorithm each processor is associated with an
element of the sequence.
