Bob is designing a new window management system (called {\em FancyWin

'99}) with 3-D (virtual reality!) capabilities.  In order to implement
efficient window redrawing procedures, Bob needs to determine whether
two windows intersect.  Show how to solve the following intersection
problems:

\begin{enumerate}

\item  Each window is a 2-D rectangle with sides parallel to the axes,
represented by the coordinates of its lower-left and upper-right
vertices.  Given two 2-D windows $((x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2))$ and $((x_3,
y_3), (x_4, y_4))$, determine whether they intersect.

\item  Each window is a 3-D box with sides parallel to the axes,
represented by the coordinates of its lower-left-rear and
upper-right-front vertices.  Given two 3-D windows $((x_1, y_1, z_1),
(x_2, y_2, z_2))$ and $((x_3, y_3, z_3), (x_4, y_4, z_4))$, determine
whether they intersect.

\end{enumerate}

\noindent  Don't forget to consider the intersection case when one
rectangle (or box) completely contains the other.
