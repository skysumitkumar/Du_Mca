Assume an array representation of a heap for this question. The
operation that we want to implement is the {\em union} of 2 heaps. The
{\em union} of 2 heaps is a heap consisting of the union of the
elements from heap1 and heap2.

\begin{enumerate}
\item  Describe an algorithm to implement the union of 2 heaps, $H1$
and $H2$. A brief description in 3-4 sentences is enough.
 
\item  If the number of elements in the heaps are $n1$ and $n2$
respectively, analyze the running time of your operation and give it
in $O$ notation.
\end{enumerate}
