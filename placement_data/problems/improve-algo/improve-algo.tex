\begin{enumerate}

\item  Suppose it is known that the running time of an algorithm is
$2n^2$ microseconds, and that the running time of another algorithm
for solving the same problem is $200n$ microseconds, where $n$ is the
input size. Which one would you prefer, assuming all other factors
equal?  {\em Hint:} Your choice may depend on $n$.

\item  Could you use these two algorithms to develop an algorithm
which works fast for all input sizes? 

\end{enumerate}
