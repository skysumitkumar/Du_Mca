The {\em Towers of Providence} is a variation of the classical Towers of
Hanoi problem.  There are four pegs, denoted $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$,
and $N$ disks of different sizes.  Originally, all the disks are on peg
$A$, stacked in decreasing size from bottom to top. Our goal is to
transfer all the disks to peg $D$, and the rules are that we can only
move one disk at a time, and no disk can be moved onto a smaller one.

We can solve this problem with a recursive method:  If $N=1$, move this
disk directly to peg $D$, and we are done. Otherwise ($N>1$), perform
the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item  transfer the top $N-2$ disks on peg $A$ to peg $B$ applying the
method recursively;
\item  move the second largest disk from peg $A$ to peg $C$;
\item  move the largest disk from peg $A$ to peg $D$;
\item  move the second largest disk from peg $C$ to peg $D$;
\item  transfer the $N-2$ disks on peg $B$ to peg $D$ applying
the method recursively.
\end{enumerate}
\medskip
Let $T(N)$ be the total number of moves needed to transfer
$N$ disks.  We have:

\[  T(1) = 1 ; ~~~~~~~~~~ T(N) = 2 T(N-2) + 3 . \]

Unfold this recurrence relation to obtain a closed-form expression for
$T(N)$.  Assume that $N$ is odd.
