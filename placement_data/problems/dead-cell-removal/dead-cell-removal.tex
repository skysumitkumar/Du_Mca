The problem of {\em removing inactive elements} is defined as follows:
You are given a singly-linked list containing $N$ elements.  Some of
them are marked as inactive.  You want to have them removed from the
list, so that at the end of the removal operation, the list contains
no inactive elements.

\begin{enumerate}

	\item  (30\%  credit) Give a sequential algorithm that removes
	inactive elements from the list.  What is the complexity of
	your algorithm?

	\item  (70\%  credit) Modify the pointer-jumping technique to get
	a parallel algorithm that solves the same problem using $N$
	processors. Optimally, your algorithm should work in $O(\log
	K)$ steps, where $K$ is the maximum number of consecutive
	inactive elements.

\end{enumerate}
