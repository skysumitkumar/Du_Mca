\begin{enumerate}
\item  Draw a biconnected graph with 5 vertices and 5 edges.
\item  Let $G$ be a biconnected graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges,
  and assume that $n \geq  2$.  Show that $m \geq  n$.
\item  Draw a graph with 5 vertices and 7 edges that is connected
  but not biconnected (i.e., it has a cutvertex). This shows that
  the above condition ($m \geq  n$) is necessary but not sufficient for
  a graph to be biconnected.
\end{enumerate}
