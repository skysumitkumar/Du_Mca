One of the good things about using computers is that it can make you
seem smarter to mom and dad on Sunday mornings when they try to do the
NYTimes crossword.  It also makes them happy that you are worth the
money they pay to Brown.

Very often, there is this strange word they try to find, but there is a
letter missing and they have no clue of what is the middle name of the
famous Roman speaker who said ''Delenda (est) Carthago.''  All you know,
is that his or her middle name is  {\sf ?orcius}, where {\sf ?} is the
missing letter.  Now, you have Britannica on-line, but you cannot
search the whole thing just to find that name --- plus, even if you do,
it will not seem as if you had it in your mind.  Your whole education is
at stake!

So, what you want is to modify the Rabin-Karp algorithm we learned in
class to be able to search for incomplete words. You would like to type
in something like {\sf ?orcius} and have the program match this pattern
quickly to the correct answer {\sf Porcius}.  What modifications are
needed in the Rabin-Karp algorithm for this to work?
