\begin{enumerate}

\item  Suppose it is known that the running time of an algorithm is
$(1/3)n^2 + 6n$, and that the running time of another algorithm for
solving the same problem is $111n -312$. Which one would you prefer,
assuming all other factors equal?  {\em Hint:} Your choice may depend
on the input size $n$.

\item  Of course, ``all other factors'' are never exactly equal for two
algorithms.  There is no question that execution time is important, but
there are other factors to consider when choosing an algorithm.  Can
you think of other considerations?

\end{enumerate}
