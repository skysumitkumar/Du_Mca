There is a simple algorithm called Count~Sort that will construct a new
sorted list from a given list $L$ provided that all the keys in $L$ are
different from each other. Count Sort goes through $L$ once, and for
each member~(key)  in $L$ scans $L$ to count how many keys are less than
that key. If $c$ is the count then the proper position in the sorted
list for the key is $c+1$. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item  Write a pseudo-code for Count Sort.
\item  Determine the number of comparisions made by Count~Sort.
\end{enumerate}
