A hash table of size $M$ stores $N$ integer keys.  Collisions are
handled by {\em chaining} and the hash function is $h(K) = K \bmod  M$.

\begin{enumerate}

\item  What is the worst-case search time?  Give an example of a set of
keys that achieves the worst-case search time.

\item  Would you use this hash table for a time-critical application (e.g.,
air-traffic control)?

\end{enumerate}
