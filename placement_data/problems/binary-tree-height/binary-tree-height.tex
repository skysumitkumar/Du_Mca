Let $T$ be a binary tree.  

\begin{enumerate}

\item  If $T$ has seven nodes, what is it's minimum height?  What is 
      it's maximum height? Draw two trees with seven nodes that achieve
      the minimum and maximum height, respectively.

\item  Assume $T$ has $N$ nodes, where $N=2^{k}-1$ for some positive
      integer $k$.  If $h(N)$ denotes the minimum height of $T$, then
      $h(N)=h((N-1)/2)+1$ and $h(1)=0$. Also, if $H(N)$ denotes the
      maximum height of $T$, then $H(N)=H(N-2)+1$ and $H(1)=0$.
      Explain the logic behind these recurrence equations (i.e., why
      does $h(N)=h((N-1)/2)+1$ and why does $H(N)=H(N-2)+1$?).  In
      addition, solve them explicitly.

\end{enumerate}
