Newark airport is developing a computer simulation of air-traffic
control, which handles events such as landings and take-offs.  Each
event has a {\em time-stamp} that denotes the time when the event
occurs.

The simulation program needs to perform efficiently the following two
fundamental operations:

\begin{itemize}

\item    insert a new event with a given time-stamp
	(i.e., add a future event);

\item    extract the event with smallest time-stamp
	(i.e., determine the next event to process).

\end{itemize}

Which data structure would you use to support the above operations?
