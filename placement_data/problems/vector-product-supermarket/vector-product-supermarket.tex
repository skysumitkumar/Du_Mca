A wholesaler wants to speed up its large volume of accounting
operations using parallel computation.  Given $N$ products
$s_1,s_2,\cdots,s_N$,  let $p_i$ be the unit price of $s_i$ and $q_i$ be
the quantity of $s_i$ purchased by a customer.  The amount to be billed
to the customer is $\sum_{i=1}^{N} p_i \cdot  q_i$, which can be
computed sequentially in $O(N)$ time.

\begin{enumerate}

\item  (60\%  credit) Give an {\em efficient} parallel PRAM algorithm for
solving the billing problem in time $O(\log  N)$.  Specify the number of
processors you're using and the type of PRAM (EREW, CREW, etc.).

\item  (40\%  credit) Give an {\em optimal} parallel PRAM algorithm for
solving the billing problem in time $O(\log  N)$.  Specify the number of
processors you're using and the type of PRAM (EREW, CREW, etc.).

\end{enumerate}
