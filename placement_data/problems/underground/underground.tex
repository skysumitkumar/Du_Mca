An undergound organization is getting ready to start a revolution.
The $N$ members have organized themselves in a strict 
hierarchy (as is appropriate for any serous underground organization 
that respects itself):
Each member is assigned an importance number, $i$. He or she receives orders
from member $i-1$, and gives orders to member $i+1$. 
When the Leader, also known as member 1, decides that the time has come, he 
makes a phonecall to the Vice-Leader, member 2, who in turn, phones
the Vice-Vice-Leader member 3, etc., until all members have been informed.

Unfortunately, the last couple of times that the Leader sent his
message to start the revolution, only 5\%  of the members got it on
time, and so the revolution was postponed. But this time, they have a
new leader, Tam Asia, who has arrived after completing successfully
CS16.  Tam has a grand scheme of speeding up the phonecall process
greatly, by asking each member $i$ to call 2 other members $j$ and
$k$, instead of one. He has nick-named the scheme Operation Member
Jumping (OMJ).

Explain what his idea is all about and how he plans to implement it.
What is the relation of numbers $k$ and $j$ to $i$?  Also explain why
after $\log_2  N$ phonecall rounds, everyone will be talkin' 'bout a
revolution.
