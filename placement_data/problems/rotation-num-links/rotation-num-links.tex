A right rotation is shown in the figure below:

\begin{enumerate}

\item  Mention all the links that are modified by a right rotation.
(For example, $x$'s left child now points to $y$, etc.)

\item  How much time does it take to perform a right rotation in an
$N$-node AVL tree?

\item  Argue that a right rotation operation preserves the inorder
sequence of the keys.

\end{enumerate}
