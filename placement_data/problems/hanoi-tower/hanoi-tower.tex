The {\em Tower of Hanoi} is a classical problem which can be solved by
recurrence.  There are three pegs and $N$ disks of different sizes.
Originally, all the disks are on the left peg, stacked in decreasing
size from bottom to top. Our goal is to transfer all the disks to the
right peg, and the rules are that we can only move one disk at a time,
and no disk can be moved onto a smaller one. We can easily solve this
problem with the following recursive method:  If $N=1$, move this disk
directly to the right peg and we are done. Otherwise ($N>1$), first
transfer the top $N-1$ disks to the middle peg applying the method
recursively, then move the largest disk to the right peg, and finally
transfer the $N-1$ disks on the middle peg to the right peg applying
the method recursively. Let $T(N)$ be the total number of moves needed
to transfer $N$ disks.  We have that $T(1)=1$, and $T(N) = 2T(N-1) +
1$.  Unfold this recurrence relation to obtain a closed-form expression
for $T(N)$.
