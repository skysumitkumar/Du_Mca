Let $F$ be an ASCII file containing $n$ total characters.  Suppose
that in scanning $F$ we have found (roughly) equal occurrences of each
of the $256$ ASCII characters. Why doesn't Huffman encoding help to
compress the file in this case?  Explain.  Assume that all characters
have $8$ bit representations in ASCII.
