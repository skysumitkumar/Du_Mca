The scientists of Space Lab want to sort their remote sensoring data to
reconstruct the 3-D images of the surface of Mars. They have one
million 64-bit integers to sort.

\begin{enumerate}

\item  If they use quicksort, estimate the number of key value
comparisons performed. ({\em Hint:} consider the average time
complexity of quicksort.)

\item  If they treat these integers as four-digit, radix-$2^{16}$
numbers and use straight radix sort based on the radix-$2^{16}$
notation, how many sorting passes are required to do the sorting?

\item  Unfortunately, the computer in the Space Lab has only 9 megabytes
of available memory for running the sorting task.  Is it practical to
choose bucket sort to be the stable sorting method in the
implementation of the above straight radix sort? Explain your answer.

\end{enumerate}
