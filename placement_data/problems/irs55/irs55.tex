The Internal Revenue Service expects to receive about 55 million
returns this year, and will need to sort them by SSN. Assume that the
IRS computer can compare two SSN's in one $\mu$second.  (1 day $ =
864\cdot  10^8 \mu$secs.)  Is selection-sort a good method for the task?
How about bubble-sort or insertion-sort?  How long would it take for
the sorting to be done?
