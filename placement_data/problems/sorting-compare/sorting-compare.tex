This problem will make you compare the characteristics of the sorting
algorithms you learned in class.

\begin{enumerate}

\item  Which of the sorting algorithms you learned are stable?

\item  Which sorting algorithm would be best for an air-traffic control
program where thousands of flights must be sorted quickly, and
slow sorting should never occur?  Why?

\item  Which sorting algorithm should you almost never use?  Why?

\end{enumerate}
