Use extendible hashing to insert the sequence of keys {\tt

HASHTABLEISFUN} into an initially empty table.  Draw all intermediate
results.  As in the example shown in class, assume that the bucket size
is 4 and that the $i$-th letter of the alphabet is represented by
number $i$ written in binary with 5 bits (e.g., {\tt B} is represented
by 00010).
