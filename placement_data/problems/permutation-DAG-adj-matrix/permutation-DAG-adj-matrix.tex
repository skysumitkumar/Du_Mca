Suppose we are given directed acyclic graph $G=(V,E)$ where
$V=\{v_{1},v_{2},\ldots,v_{n}\}$.  Show that if $v_{1},v_{2},\ldots,v_{n}$ is
a topological ordering of the vertices of $V$, then the adjacency matrix 
corresponding to $G$ is an {\em upper triangular matrix} (that is, all enties 
below the main diagonal are zero).
