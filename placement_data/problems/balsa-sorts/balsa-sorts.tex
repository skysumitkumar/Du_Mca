Run the balsa demo ``sorts'' and restore the window named
``sorts-selinsbub''. Run the demo. What do the color patterns in
the ``Chips'' windows represent? In particular, compare the color
patterns for selection sort, insertion sort, and bubble sort. How
do the color patterns represent the differences in the algorithms?
