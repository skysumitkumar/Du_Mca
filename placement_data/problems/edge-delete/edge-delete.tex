Let $G$ be an {\em undirected} graph with vertex set
$\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\}$ and with $m$ edges. We denote with $(i,j)$ the
edge connecting vertex $i$ and vertex $j$, and with $d(i)$ the degree
of vertex~$i$.

We define the following two operations:
\begin{description}
\item[{\sf deleteEdge}$(i,j)$:] delete from $G$ a given edge $(i,j)$.
\item  [{\sf deleteIncidentEdges}$(i)$:] delete from $G$ all the $d(i)$
  edges incident on a given vertex $i$.
\end{description}
Provide a precise analysis of the time complexity of operations {\sf

  deleteEdge} and {\sf deleteIncidentEdges} for the following two
representations of graph $G$:
\begin{enumerate}
\item  Graph $G$ is represented by an $n \times  n$ boolean matrix $A$
  such that $A[i,j]$ is true if and only if $G$ contains edge
  $(i,j)$.
\item  Graph $G$ is represented by $n$ sequences $S_1, \ldots  , S_n$,
  where sequence $S_i$ contains all the $d(i)$ vertices adjacent to
  vertex $i$ and is realized by means of a doubly-linked list.
\end{enumerate}
