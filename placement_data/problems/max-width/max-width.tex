NASA wants to link $N$ stations spread over the country using
communication channels.  For every pair of stations, there is a
badnwidth associated with the channel between them, which is known a
priori.

It (NASA) wants to select $N-1$ channels (the minimum possible) in
such a way that all the stations are linked by the channels and the
total bandwidth (defined as the sum of the individual bandwidths of
the channels) is maximum.  Give an efficient algorithm for this
problem and determine its worst-case time complexity.
