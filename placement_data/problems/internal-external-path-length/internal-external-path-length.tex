Consider a binary tree in which any node has either zero or two children.
Let $n$ be the number of internal nodes. The {\em external path length}
$E_n$ is defined as the sum of the depths of all the external nodes.
Similarly, the {\em internal path length} $I_n$ is defined as the sum of the 
depths of all the internal nodes. Show that $E_n = I_n + 2n$.
