$X$, who has completed his Ph.D on compression algorithms, has
proposed an algorithm, which he claims, compresses {\em any} file by
at least 10\%  of its original size. (i.e. If A file's length was $x$
bytes before compression, its not greater than $0.9x$ after
compression). Should he be shortlisted in the Brown Faculty search?
Justify your conclusion.
