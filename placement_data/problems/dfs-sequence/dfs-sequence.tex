Suppose that graph $G$  has the following adjacency lists:
%
\begin{eqnarray*}
 1 & - & (2,3,4) \\
  2 & - & (1,3,4) \\
  3 & - & (1,2,4) \\
  4 & - & (1,2,3,6) \\
  5 & - & (6,7,8) \\
  6 & - & (4,5,7) \\
  7 & - & (5,6,8) \\
  8 & - & (5,7)
\end{eqnarray*}
%
\begin{enumerate}

\item  Draw $G$.

\item  Give the equivalent adjacenty matrix representation.

\item  Give the sequence of vertices visited using depth-first search starting at vertex 1. Use recursive depth-first search on adjacency lists, as explained in class.

\end{enumerate}
