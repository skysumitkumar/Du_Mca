A robot currently at position $A$ needs to move to position $B$ (see
the figure below).  The robot's sensors indicate that there is an
obstacle in between.  What algorithm should the robot use to find a
trajectory of minimum length between $A$ and $B$ that avoids the
obstacle?  Assume that the obstacle is a simple polygon $P$, and that
the robot knows the coordinates of $A$, $B$, and of the vertices of
$P$. 

You can also assume that $A$ is to the left of the obstacle and $B$ is
to the right.
