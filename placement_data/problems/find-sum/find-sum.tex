Given a set $S$ of $N$ integers, stored as an unsorted linked list, and
another integer $z$, design an $O(N \log  N)$-time algorithm that
determines whether there exist two elements, $x$ and $y$, in $S$ such
that $x+y=z$.

Describe your algorithm in English or in pseudocode.  Mention any
additional data structure used, and explain why the time-complexity is
$O(N \log  N)$.
