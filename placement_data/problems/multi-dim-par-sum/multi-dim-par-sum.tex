We have seen that a two-dimensional array of processors is faster than
a one-dimensional array for computing sums.  What will the time
complexity be if we use a three-dimensional array?  And what about a
$d$-dimensional array?  Does the {\em efficiency} of the algorithm
increase with the dimension $d$?
{\em Hint:} To get started,
think of a 2-D array as a square of size $\sqrt{N} \times  \sqrt{N}$,
a 3-D array as a cube with dimensions $N^{1/3} \times  N^{1/3} \times  N^{1/3}$,
etc.
