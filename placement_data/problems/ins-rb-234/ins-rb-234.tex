\begin{enumerate}

\item  Perform the following sequence of key insertions into an
  initially empty 2-3-4 tree:
  \begin{center} \tt
        R E D S O X C U B Z V W
  \end{center}
  Use {\em bottom-up} rebalancing, and draw the tree after every
  insertion.
  
\item  Perform the above sequence of key insertions into an initially
  empty red-black tree.  Draw the tree after every insertion.
  
\item  Compare the 2-3-4 tree and the red-black tree resulting from the
  above sequence of insertions.  How are they related?

\end{enumerate}
