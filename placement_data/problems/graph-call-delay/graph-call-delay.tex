The time delay of a long distance call can be determined by multiplying
a small fixed constant to the number of communication links on the
telephone network between the caller and callee. Suppose the telephone
network of RT\&T  is a tree.  The engineers of RT\&T  want to compute the
maximum possible time delay that may be experienced in a long-distance
call.

Given a tree $T$ with $N$ nodes, the {\em diameter} of $T$ is the
length of a longest path between two nodes of~$T$.  Give an efficient
algorithm for computing the diameter of~$T$.

{\it Note/Hint}: A solution to this problem is closely related to a solution 
of the previous problem.
