Each of $n$ keys in an array may have one of the values {\it

red,white} or {\it blue}. Give a linear time algorithm for rearranging
the keys so that all the reds come before all the blues and all the
blues come before all the whites. The only operations permitted on the
keys are 
\begin{itemize}
\item  Examination of a key to find out what color it is.
\item  A swap (interchange of positions) of two keys specified by
their indices.
\end{itemize}
