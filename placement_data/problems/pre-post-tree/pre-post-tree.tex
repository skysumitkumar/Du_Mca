In the late eighties, CS~16 was called CS~21, OOP was the
beginning of oops, Meadow was a piece of grassland, and the happy
students enjoyed so much programming in C that they created the motto:

\centerline{\em CS 21 means big fun!}

\begin{enumerate}

\item  Consider binary trees that have single characters stored at each
internal node.  Draw a binary tree that  will spell out {\tt

CS21MEANSBIGFUN} upon a pre-order traversal and {\tt 1M2AESBISFNUGNC}
upon a post-order one. 

\item  Is this the unique tree that satisfies those conditions?

\end{enumerate}
