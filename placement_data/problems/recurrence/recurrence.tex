In a recent empirical study, it was discovered that the number of
computer science concentrators at Brown has grown every year since the
department's creation according to the following recurrence:

\[  T(N)=2T(N-1)+1;~~~T(1)=1.\]

\noindent  Solve this recurrence to discover an explicit formula for
$T(N)$.
