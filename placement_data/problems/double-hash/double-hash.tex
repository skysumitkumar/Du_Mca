You have a hashtable of size $m=11$ and two hash functions $h1$ and $h2$:

$h1(x)$ = (sum of the values of the first and last letters of $x$) mod $m$ \\
$h2(x)$ = ((value of the last letter) mod $(m-1)$) +1  \\

where the value of a letter is its position in the alphabet
(e.g., value(a)=1, value(b)=2, etc.).  

Here are some precomputed hash values: 

word ape bat bird carp dog hare ibex mud koala stork 
h1 6 0 6 7 0 2 0 6 1 8 
h2 6 1 5 7 8 6 10 5 2 2

\begin{enumerate}
\item  Draw a picture of the resulting hashtable after inserting, in
order, the following words: \\

ibex, hare, ape, bat, koala, mud, dog, carp, stork.

\item  Highlight cells that are looked at when trying to find bird. Do
this for each of the following techniques.  Chaining with h1 as your
hash function.  Linear probing with h1 as your hash function.  Double
hashing with h1 as your first hash function and h2 as your second hash
function.
\end{enumerate}
