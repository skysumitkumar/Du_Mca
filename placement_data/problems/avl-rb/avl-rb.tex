Consider the following sequence of keys: 10, 30, 50, 70, 90.

\begin{itemize}

\item  Insert the above keys, in the order given, into an initially
empty red-black tree.

\item  Insert the above keys, in the order given, into an initially
empty AVL tree.

\end{itemize}

Draw all the intermediate results.
