\begin{enumerate}
\item  We have studied two similar looking data structures, the
binary-search-tree and the heap. What is the difference between these
two?

\item  An in-order traversal of a binary-search tree can be used to print out
the elements of an $n$-node tree in sorted order in $O(n)$ time. Can
the same be done with a heap? Explain why or why not.
\end{enumerate}
