A telephone network diagram is a weighted graph where the vertices
represent switching centers and the edges represent lines between two
centers.  The edges are labeled by their bandwidth. We define the
bandwidth of a path as the smallest bandwidth of an edge in the path.

Give an algorithm that computes a path of maximum bandwidth between
two given vertices of a telephone network diagram.
 
For example, in the telephone network diagram shown below, $v_1 v_2
v_4$ is a path of maximum bandwidth (equal to 5) between vertices
$v_1$ and $v_4$, and $v_1 v_2 v_4 v_3$ is a path of maximum bandwidth
(equal to 4) between vertices $v_1$ and $v_4$
