As your reward for saving the Kingdom of Bigfunnia from the evil
``Exponential Asymptotic'' the king has given you the opportunity to
earn some ``big cash''.  Behind the castle (near the hot tub) there is
a maze.  Along each corridor of the maze there is a bag of gold coins.
The amount of gold in each bag varies.  You will be given the
opportunity to walk through the maze, picking up bags of gold.  You may
enter only through the door marked ``ENTER'' and exit through the door
marked ``EXIT''.  (These are separate doors).  While in the maze you
may not retrace your steps.  Each corridor of the maze has an arrow
painted on the wall.  You may only go down the corridor in the
direction of the arrow.  There is no way to traverse a ``loop'' in the
maze.  You will receive a map of the maze, including the amount of gold
in and the direction of each corridor.  
Describe an algorithm to help you  pick up the most gold?
