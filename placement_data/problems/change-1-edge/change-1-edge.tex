You want to increase the maximum flow in a network,
by changing the capacity of {\em only one} edge.
\begin{enumerate}

\item
Explain how you would do it. What is the complexity of your
algorithm?
(Hint: What is the role of the minimum cut?)

\item
Demonstrate your method on the network of the previous problem.

\item  Is it always possible to increase the maximum flow in a network,
by changing the capacity of {\em only one} edge?
\end{enumerate}
