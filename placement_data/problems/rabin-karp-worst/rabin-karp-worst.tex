Suppose we have pattern $c_{1}c_{2} \ldots  c_{m}$ and text
$x_{1}x_{2} \ldots  x_{n}$ where $m \leq  n$.  Also, assume that for any strings
$x$ and $y$, $hash(x)=hash(y)$ 
if and only if $x$ and $y$ are composed of precisely the same characters.
If the Rabin-Karp algorithm then acts on $c_{1}c_{2} \ldots  c_{m}$ and
$x_{1}x_{2} \ldots  x_{n}$ exactly as the brute force method of string 
searching does, what is the relationship between the input pattern and the 
input text?
