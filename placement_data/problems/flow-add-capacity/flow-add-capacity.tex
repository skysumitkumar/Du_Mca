Consider the following flow network, where  S is the source and T is the sink.

\end{center}

\begin{enumerate}
\item  Compute a maximum flow for this network using the Ford \&
    Fulkerson algorithm.  Give the sequence of augmenting paths and the
  value of the maximum flow.
\item  Suppose one additional unit of capacity is available now.  Find
  an edge $e$ such that if the capacity of $e$ is increased by one,
  then also the value of the maximum flow in the network is increased
  by one.  Justify your choice.
\end{enumerate}
