We can represent a box in a 3D space by the coordinates of a pair of its two
opposite vertices. For instance, a cube with side length 1 whose 
lower-left corner is
located at the original can be represented by a pair of coordinates
which is $((0,0,0),(1,1,1))$. Given two boxes $((x_1,y_1,z_1),
(x_2,y_2,z_2))$ and $((x_3,y_3,z_3),(x_4,y_4,z_4))$, how to determine
if these two boxes intersect? Note that if one box completely encompasses
the other, they are also said to intersect. ({\em Hint:} Consider the
case for a 2D rectangle at first.)
