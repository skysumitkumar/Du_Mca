BT\&T  (Big Telephone \&  Telegraph) has 256 million customers.  Their
current telephone directory consists of many heavy volumes typeset in
small point size, which are expensive to print and inconvenient to
use.  To overcome the above problems, BT\&T  has decided to set up an
on-line computerized directory, and their software engineers are
debating what is the most efficient data structure for the purpose.
Assume that the BT\&T  computer can compare two names in one
microsecond.

\begin{enumerate}

\item  One of the engineers, who did not take any course beyond CS~15,
suggests to implement the on-line directory as an unsorted linked
list.  With this implementation, give an estimate of the worst-case
search and insertion times.

\item  Another engineer, who had taken CS~16, wants to implement the
on-line directory as an AVL tree.  With this implementation, give an
estimate of the worst-case search and insertion times.

\item  A third engineer proposes the use of a sorted array.  What kind
of arguments can she make to support her proposal?

\end{enumerate}
