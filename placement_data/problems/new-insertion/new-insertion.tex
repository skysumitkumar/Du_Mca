Consider the following variation of insertion sort.  Assume $A$ is the array
we are sorting and that $A[1]$, $A[2]$, $\ldots$  , $A[p]$ is the subarray of
$A$ which is currently sorted.  Rather than sequentially searching for
$A[p+1]$'s position in $A[1]$,  $\ldots$  , $A[p]$, suppose we perform a binary
search.  If this is the case for $1\leq  p \leq  n-1$ (where $n$ is the size of
$A$), then what is the time complexity of the sorting algorithm?
