Suppose we alter quicksort's {\em partition} function as follows:  Instead of 
simply partitioning around {\tt List[Right]}, we find the
median of {\tt List[Left], List[Right]}, and {\tt List[Right-1]},
then partition around this median.  How many 
comparisons does quicksort perform
in the worst case if we use this scheme?  Note: Don't forget
the comparisons necessary to find the median.
