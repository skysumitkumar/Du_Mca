Congratulations! Your interview with BT\&T    went exceptionally well, and you are
hired by the company's vice president, with a salary that beats your cs16
instructor's salary, to help in the project described in the previous question.
However, your manager Mr. T.H.E. Meansob, angry with your success, challenges
you --- in front of the whole team that made the suggestions in the previous
question --- to justify your salary by coming up with a better solution or
else. After thinking deeply for hours without success, you decide to ask for
help your old cs16 instructor, and pick up the telephone book to look up his
phone number. Wow! You open the huge telephone book exactly on the page that
contains his name, and you wonder how did that happen. Well, the book's entries
are sorted, but you did not do a binary search neither did you use any tree or
plant or animal. You just opened the book {\em at the place that you expected to

find the letter ``T''} and
$voila!$ You realize that you can use this observation to win the challenge.
Explain how.
