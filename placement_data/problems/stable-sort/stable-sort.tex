A sorting algorithm is said to be {\em stable} if it does not exchange
the relative positions of items with equal keys.  More formally, a
sorting algorithm is stable if, for any two elements $a$ and $b$ with
equal keys, $a$ precedes $b$ {\em after} the sorting if and only if $a$
precedes $b$ {\em before} the sorting.  Given this definition, is the
bubble sort algorithm which was covered in class a stable sorting
algorithm? Explain.
