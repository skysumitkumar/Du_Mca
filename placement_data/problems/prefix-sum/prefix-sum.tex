The {\it prefix sum with operation addition} problem is defined as follows:
Given an array of numbers $I[1..N]$, output a new array $O[1..N]$  in which
$O[i] = \sum_1^i  I[i]$.
For example, when $I[1..5] = 3, 2, 5, 1, 2$, we get
$O[1..5] = 3, 5, 10, 11, 13$.

Sequentially, this is a very easy problem to solve. Give a parallel algorithm
for solving this problem in $\log  N$ time using $N$ processors.
{\em Hint:} Look at slide 599 on the mirror....

NOTE that you can define the ``prefix sum'' problem over {\em any} binary,
associative operation, not only addition.
For example, if the operation is $minimum$, every element in the output
array will contain the minimum of all the elements to its left in the
input array. In the numerical example above, the result 
of prefix sum with operation $minimum$ would be
$3, 2, 2, 1, 1$.
