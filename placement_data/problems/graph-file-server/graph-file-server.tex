Tamarindo University and many other schools worldwide are doing a joint
project on multimedia. A computer network is built to connect
these schools using communication links that form a tree.  The schools
decide to install a file server at one of them to share data.  Since
the transmission time on a link is dominated by the link setup and
synchronization, the cost of a data transfer is proportional to the
number of links used.  Hence, it is desirable to choose a ``central''
location for the file server.

Given a tree $T$ and a node $v$ of $T$, the {\em eccentricity} of $v$
is the length of a longest path from $v$ to any other node of
$T$.  A node of $T$ with minimum eccentricity is called a {\em center}
of~$T$.

\begin{enumerate}

\item  Design an efficient algorithm that given an $N$-node tree $T$,
computes a center of $T$.

\item  Is the center unique?  If not, how many distinct centers can a
tree have?

\end{enumerate}
{\it Hint:}
Consider a tree $T$ and the tree $T'$ produced by pruning the leaves
of $T$. What is the relation between the centers of $T$ and $T'$?
