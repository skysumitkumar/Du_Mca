Give a parallel algorithm that computes the maximum of $N$ numbers in
$O(1)$ time on an $N$-processor CRCW {\em smallest} PRAM. Note that in
a {\em smallest} CRCW PRAM, if concurrent write operations occur, the
smallest number will be written into the given memory cell.  Also,
determine the extra space (i.e., the space in addition to the $N$
memory locations for storing the $N$ numbers) used by your algorithm.
