There are eight small islands in a lake and we want to build seven
bridges to connect them so that each island can be reached by the
others.  The distances in feet between pairs of islands are given in
the following table.

\begin{verbatim}
                    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8

                1   -   240  210  340  280  200  345  120
                2   -    -   265  175  215  180  185  155
                3   -    -    -   260  115  350  435  195
                4   -    -    -    -   160  330  295  230
                5   -    -    -    -    -   360  400  170
                6   -    -    -    -    -    -   175  205
                7   -    -    -    -    -    -    -   305
                8   -    -    -    -    -    -    -    - 
\end{verbatim}

Find which bridges to build so that their total length is minimum.
Use the minimum spanning tree algorithm taught in class, starting from
island~1

Show the execution of the algorithm using the following tabular
format, where each row of the table corresponds to a step of the
algorithm.  The first row has been filled for your convenience.
Complete the table with the remaining 7 rows

\begin{verbatim}
Step    Spanning Tree       Fringe             Unseen   Bridge Selected
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

0       {1}                 {2,3,4,5,6,7,8}    {}           none
\end{verbatim}
