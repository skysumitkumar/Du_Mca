If we apply DFS to a graph, we will get some back edges. Note that back
edges are directed edges. Show that for any back edge $(u,v)$, $v$ can
only be the direct ancestor of $u$ in the DFS tree. $v$ is the ``Directed 
ancestor'' of $u$ if and only if there exists a sequence of vertices 
$u,v_1,v_2,\cdots,v_n,v$
such that $(u,v_1),(v_2,v_3),\cdots,(v_n,v)$  are tree edges.
