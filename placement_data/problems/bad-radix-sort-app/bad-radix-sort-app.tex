Superfast Software Inc.\  was founded last year by three young
programmers. They all dreamed their company would become a really big
one and would distribute a large number of software products all over
the world.  Thus, they decided to use 64-bit integers to represent
their inventory codes. Since it is just a one-year-old company, the
inventory database now contains only 2000 distinct product codes, in
the range from 1 to 3000. At this time they need to sort these codes
and one of the co-founders suggests using a general comparison-based
$O(n \log  n)$-time sorting algorithm such as heap-sort.  But another
co-founder disagrees and suggests using radix-exchange sort because it
is a so-called ``linear time'' (that is, $O(n)$) algorithm.

Do you think radix exchange sort is good for this case? Explain your
answer.
