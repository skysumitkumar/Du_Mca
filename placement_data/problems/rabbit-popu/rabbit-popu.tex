For the rabbits in a certain zoo, the population increases in
such a way that:
%
\begin{eqnarray}
    T(N) & = & 2 \cdot  T(N-1) + 3 \nonumber  \\
        T(1) & = & 4 \nonumber
\end{eqnarray} 
%
where $T(N)$ is the population of the $N$-th year. Unfold this 
recurrence relation and obtain an expression for the number of rabbits
in the zoo in the $N$-th year.

At one stage in Australia, the number of predators for rabbits was
very low and rabbits were more or less multiplying at will. Can you
imagine the plight of the people there if the above recurrence were
obeyed? (Of course, it did not hold true, but Australia still had a
problem of too many rabbits.)
