BT\&T  has a complex project to carry out, and $N$ alternative plans
have been proposed for completing the project.  Each plan $p$ can be
represented by a pair $(t(p),c(p))$ where $t(p)$ is the time (duration)
and $c(p)$ is the cost of plan~$p$.  We can represent these plans as
points in the plane, just let the $x$-axis represent $t$ and the
$y$-axis represent $c$.

A plan $p$ is ``bad'' if there is another plan $q$ which is both faster
and cheaper than $p$.  In the example shown below, plan $p_6$ is bad
because there is plan $p_2$ such that $t(p_2) < t(p_6)$ and $c(p_2) <
c(p_6)$.

Design an algorithm that takes as input the list of plans, and returns
a revised list where the bad plans have been removed.  In the example
below, the algorithm should return a list containing plans $p_1$,
$p_2$, $p_3$ and $p_5$. Your algorithm should have the time complexity
$O(N \log  N)$.
