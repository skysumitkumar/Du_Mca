You are given a set $P$ of $n$ distinct points, $p_1,p_2,\ldots  p_n$,
on the circumference of a circle centered at $p_0=(0,0)$.  Give an
$O(n \log  n)$-time algorithm to determine whether $P$ contains two
diametrically opposite points (i.e., a pair of distinct points $p_i$
and $p_j$ of $P$ such that $p_i$, $p_0$ and $p_j$ are collinear).
