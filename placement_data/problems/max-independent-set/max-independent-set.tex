An independent set of a graph $G = (V,E)$ is a subset $I$ of $V$ such
that no two vertices in $I$ are adjacent.  That is, if $u,v \in  I$ then
$(u,v) \not\in  E$.  A {\it maximal independent set} $M$ is an
independent set such that $M \cup  \{u\}$ is not independent for any $u
\in  V - M$.  In other words, adding any other vertex to $M$ creates a
set that is not independent.  Every graph has a maximal independent
set.  (Can you see this?  --- This question is not part of the homework
but is worth thinking about.) Give an efficient algorithm that computes
a maximal independent set for a graph $G$.
