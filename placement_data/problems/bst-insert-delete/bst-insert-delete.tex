\begin{enumerate}
\item  Consider the binary-search-tree shown in the next page. Perform the
the following operations in the order shown below starting from that
configuration. Draw the tree after each operation has been performed.

\begin{enumerate}
\item  insert 12 
\item  insert 8
\item  delete 4 
\item  delete 9
\item  delete 3
\end{enumerate}

In case a node to be deleted has two chidren, then replace the node
with its {\em successor} and delete the successor from its original
position.

\item  We want to insert the numbers in the set \{1,2,3..15\} into an
initially empty binary search tree. Give an ordering of the insertions
of these elements into the search tree so that the the height of the
resulting search tree is minimum. For example, the ordering
(1,2,3...15) would give us a search tree of height 14.
\end{enumerate}
