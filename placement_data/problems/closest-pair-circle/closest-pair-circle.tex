The algorithm discussed in class for computing the closest pair among
$N$ points in the plane takes $O(N \log  N)$ time.  The divide and
conquer strategy employed is clever, but somewhat complicated.  Suppose
that we are given $N$ points all of which are on the same circle.
Clearly, the general algorithm will correctly determine the closest
pair of points in the set.  However, by taking advantage of the fact
that all points are cocircular, we can devise a simpler method for
finding the closest pair while not adversely affecting the time
complexity.  Develop such an algorithm.
