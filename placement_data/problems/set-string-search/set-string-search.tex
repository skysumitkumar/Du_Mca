Suppose we allow a set of alternate characters to appear in a string
search pattern.  E.g., the pattern {\tt c\{a,o,u\}b} matches {\tt

cab}, {\tt cob}, and {\tt cub}.  How can we modify the Rabin-Karp
algorithm to search for such patterns? Your algorithm {\em need not}
take care of the case where a set of alternate characters appears in
more than one position in the search string.
