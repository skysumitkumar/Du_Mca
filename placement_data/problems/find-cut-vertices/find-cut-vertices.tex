Suppose that graph $G$ is represented by the following adjacency lists:

\begin{verbatim}

          1 - (3,4)                      5 - (3,4)         
          2 - (3,6)                      6 - (2,3,7,8)
          3 - (1,5,2,6)                  7 - (6,8)
          4 - (1,5)                      8 - (6,7)

\end{verbatim}

\begin{enumerate}

\item    (20\%  credit) Draw $G$.

\item      (30\%  credit) Perform a recursive Depth-First Search (DFS) of
$G$ starting at vertex~1, and compute, for each vertex $v$, its rank
val$(v)$ in the sequence of vertices visited by the DFS.

\item    (30\%  credit) Draw the DFS tree $T$ and back edges, and label
each vertex $v$ with val$(v)$ and Min$(v)$, where Min$(v)$ is the
minimum of val$(v)$ and the smallest val$(u)$ of a vertex $u$ reachable
by a back edge from a vertex in the subtree of $T$ rooted at $v$.

\item    (20\%  credit) What are the cutvertices of $G$?  Explain how the
cutvertices can be detected using the DFS tree $T$ and the val and Min
labels.

\end{enumerate}
