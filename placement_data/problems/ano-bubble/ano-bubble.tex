Below is a variant of bubble-sort, written in C and with comments
removed.  Compare this algorithm with the standard bubble-sort taught
in class, and determine what improvement it makes.

\begin {verse} \tt
\begin {tabbing}
%
an\=other\_bubble(int  a[ ], int N) \\
\>\{  \= \\

\>\>int i,j,k,t; \\

\>\>j = N; \\

\>\>do\= \{ \\

\>\>\>fo\=r (i = k = 1; i $<$ j; i++) \\

\>\>\>\>if\= (a[i] $>$ a[i+1]) \\

\>\>\>\>\>\{ t = a[i]; a[i] = a[i+1]; a[i+1] = t; k = i; \} \\

\>\>\>j = k; \\

\>\>\>\} while (1 $<$ j); \\

\>\} \\
\end {tabbing}
\end {verse}
