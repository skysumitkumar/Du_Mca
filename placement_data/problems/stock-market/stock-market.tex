{\em The stock market problem} is as follows:  Given the price of a stock at
each  day for $n$ days, determine the biggest profit that you 
could have made by buying
one day and selling on a later day.  For example, if the stock prices are:
$$[12,11,10,8,4,8,9,6,7,7,10,7,4,2]$$
the biggest profit would be 6, 
since we could buy at 4 on day 5 and sell at 10 on day 11.

Assume that you have a parallel algorithm for prefix sum on any
binary, associative operation (i.e., you already have an algorithm
for the previous problem).
Describe a parallel algorithm that 
solves the stock market problem by using the prefix sum as a primitive 
operation. Your algorithm should use $N$ processors and
run in $O(\log{N})$ steps, where $N$ is the size of the input.
{\em Hint:} The note at the end of the previous problem will be very useful.
