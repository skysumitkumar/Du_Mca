Suppose the entering freshmen class at some university has $N$
students.  The information pertinent to each student in the class
(name, sex, identification number, etc.) can be found in some element
of $A$, an array of records indexed from $1$ to $N$.  Assume the
records are in some random order, and that we wish to rearrange the
array so that all the female records precede all the male records.
Give a linear ($O(N)$) time algorithm  which performs this ``partial
sort'' on $A$.  Assume ``sex'' is a field in each record,  with
value ``Male'' or ``Female''.
