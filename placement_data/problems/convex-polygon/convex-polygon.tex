Professor Tamassia proposes the following algorithm to determine
whether a sequence $\langle  p_0,p_1,\ldots,p_{n-1} \rangle$  of $n$
points forms the consecutive vertices of a convex polygon.

Output ``yes'' if the set $\{CCW(p_i,p_{i+1},p_{i+2})~~|~~ i =

0,1,\ldots,n-1\}$ (where subscript addition is performed modulo $n$)
contains numbers of the same sign ; otherwise output ``no''. You can
assume that $CCW(p_i,p_{i+1},p_{i+2})$ is never 0.

\begin{enumerate}
\item  Show that this method does not always give the correct answer.
\item  Modify the professor's method so that it always produces the
correct answer and runs in $O(n)$ time.
\end{enumerate}
