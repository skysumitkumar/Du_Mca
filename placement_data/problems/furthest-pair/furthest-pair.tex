A {\em furthest pair} of a set $S$ of points is a pair of points $p$
and $q$ in $S$ such that the distance between $p$ and $q$ is maximum
over all pairs of points in $S$.

\begin{enumerate}

\item  Show that $p$ and $q$ must be on the convex hull of $S$.

\item  Give an $O(N \log  N + M^2)$ algorithm to find a furthest pair,
where $N$ is the number of points, and $M$ is the size of the convex hull.

\end{enumerate}
