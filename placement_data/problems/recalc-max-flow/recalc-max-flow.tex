Suppose you are given a flow network $N$ and a maximum flow $f$ for
$N$.  Suppose $d$, a positive integer, is added to the capacity of one
edge of $N$.

\begin{enumerate}

\item  Give an efficient algorithm to compute a maximum flow for the new
network.

\item  What is the worst case time complexity of your algorithm?

\end{enumerate}
