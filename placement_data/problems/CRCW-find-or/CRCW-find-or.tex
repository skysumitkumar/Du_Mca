Tam (being the smart guy he is..) has foreseen the possibility that
someone in the group might feel weak at heart and might squeal out his
name to authorities. So, he has installed a sensor on each member's
head (without them knowing about it, of course) which outputs a 1 in
Tam's central control room whenever the person squeals out Tam's
name. He plans to vacate his office and run for his life as soon as he
finds that someone has squealed. What he wants is a circuit which
outputs a 1 as soon as someone squeals (i.e he wants to compute the
logical OR of the outputs of all the sensors).

Furthermore, since parallel algorithms is the hot topic around, he
wants you to design a CRCW {\em smallest} PRAM algorithm for this task
which executes in $O(1)$ time. Assume that there are $N$ members in
the revolution and that there are $N$ processors.

Note that in a {\em smallest} CRCW PRAM, if concurrent write
operations occur, the smallest number will be written into the given
memory cell.  Also, determine the extra space (i.e., the space in
addition to the $N$ memory locations for storing the $N$ booleans)
used by your algorithm.
