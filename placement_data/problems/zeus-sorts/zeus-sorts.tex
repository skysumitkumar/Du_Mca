Run the Zeus demo {\em Sort} on 64 input elements. (Just type the
command {\tt mentor} in your shell and then choose the option {\em

  Sort} in the {\em Sessions} menu to do this.)

\begin{enumerate}
\item  Choose the elements initially in decreasing order, and observe
  the {\em Chips} view.What do the color patterns in the Chips windows
  represent?  In particular, compare the color patterns for
  selection-sort, insertion-sort, and bubble-sort.  How do the color
  patterns visualize the differences in the algorithms? Looking at the
  {\em Dots} view may strengthen your intuition of the above process.
  
\item  Choose the elements in increasing order and look at the color
  patterns for the heap-sort algorithm. It looks as if the colors
  first travel (roughly) all the way across the array and then come
  back to their original positions. Can you explain this?
\end{enumerate}
