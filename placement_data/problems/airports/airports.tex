Suppose you are given a {\em timetable}, which consists of:

\begin{itemize}

\item  a set $\cal  A$ of $N$ airports, and for each airport $a \in  \cal
A$, a minimum connecting time $c(a)$;

\item  a set $\cal  F$ of $M$ flights, and for each flight $f \in  \cal
A$, the following information:

\begin{itemize}

\item  origin airport $a_1(f) \in  \cal  A$;

\item  destination airport $a_2(f) \in  \cal  A$;

\item  departure time $t_1(f)$; and

\item  arrival time $t_2(f)$.

\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}


Give an efficient algorithm for the following problem:

\begin{itemize}

\item[]  Given airports $a$ and $b$, and a time $t$, find a sequence of
flights that allows one to arrive at the earliest possible time in $b$
when departing from $a$ at or after time $t$.
Minimum connecting times at intermediate airports should be observed.

\end{itemize}


Also, give the time complexity of your algorithm as a function of $N$ and $M$.
