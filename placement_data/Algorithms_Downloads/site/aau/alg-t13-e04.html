 <h2>Exercise Set 13</h2> <br> <br>

<b>Exercise 1 (hand-in):</b> <br><br>

Take a look at the digraph from exercise 11.13 in the main textbook.

<UL>
<LI>  Draw the resulting BFS spanning tree and one of the possible
sequences of nodes visited during BFS of the digraph. 
There are many correct answers.

<LI>  Draw the resulting DFS spanning tree and one of the possible
sequences of nodes visited during DFS of the digraph. 
There are many correct answers.
</UL>

<br><br><br>

<b>Exercise 2:</b> <br><br>

<UL>
<li> Write an algorithm <b>reachable_nodes(g:DIGRAPH, v:VERTEX_TYPE):int</b>
which returns the number of nodes reachable from a given node v.
The node v should be included in the counting.
(Hint: Use BFS as a procedure in your program.)
<li> Let us consider that every node has a distance field.
Modify the BFS algorithm such that after the execution of
<b> bfs(g,a)</b> for every vertex v the field
<em>v.distance</em> contains the length of the shortest path from 
the start vertex a to v.
</UL>
<br><br>

<b>Exercise 3:</b> <br><br>

Model the organization scheme of your semester project as a DAG 
with cost (include only the main tasks - cca 10 to 20 nodes).
Try to put as many steps in parallel as possible and estimate
the time each task takes by a unit price (1 unit = 1 week of work).
<UL>
<LI> What is the critical path for your group in this semester?
<LI> What is the minimal time required to
complete all the tasks provided that
an optimal work distribution among the group members is possible?
</UL>

<br><br>

<b>Exercise 4:</b> <br><br>

Rewrite the algorithm <b>dfs(g:DIGRAPH,a:VERTEX_TYPE)</b> such that 
instead of recursion it uses a stack to remember which nodes 
have to be yet investigated.
