 <h3>Algorithms and Data Structures (INF1, Autumn'04)</h3>
 <h2>Lecture 10</h2>
<br>
<b>Main topic:</b> Hashing and Sorting.
<h3> Lecture Plan</h3>
<ul>
<li> hashing (symbol table implementation)
<li> comparison of different implementations of symbol table ADT
<li> insertion sort
<li> selection sort
<li> merge sort
</ul>
<h3> Reading</h3>
<ul>
<li> 
Sections 7.7, 7.9, 9.1, 9.2 and 9.3
of Algorithms and Data Structures: Design, Correctness and Analysis
by Jeffrey H. Kingston. 
(You may safely skip the mathematics in the text
having to do with <b>average</b>-case complexity of 
the operations, however, read the worst-case complexity analysis.)
