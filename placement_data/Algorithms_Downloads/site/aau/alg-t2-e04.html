 <h2>Exercise Set 2</h2>
<br>
<b>Exercise 1:</b> <br><br>

Exercise 1.1 from Algorithms and Data Structures: Design, Correctness and Analysis by Jeffrey H. Kingston.
<br><br><br>
<b>Exercise 2:</b> <br><br>

State appropriate pre- and post-conditions for the following algorithm 
and prove that it is correct with respect to that specification (find
appropriate assertions). <br><br>


procedure XY (x,y:INTEGER)<br>
x := x+y <br>
y := x-y <br>
x := x-y <br>
end <br><br><br>

<b> Exercise 3</b>:<br><br>

Let us consider the following algorithm for computing factorial. <br><br>

factorial(n)= <br>
<b>if</b> n=0 <b>then</b> return 1<br>
<b>else</b> return n*factorial(n-1)<br>
<b>endif</b><br><br>

Let us consider the following pre- and post-condition.<br><br>

-- pre: n is an integer <br>
x:=factorial(n) <br>
-- post: x=n!

<UL>
<li> Is this algorithm totally correct with respect to these pre- and
post-conditions? Why?
<li> Is this algorithm partially correct with respect to these pre- and
post-conditions? Why?
</UL>

<br>
<b> Exercise 4</b>:<br><br>

Exercise 1.2 from Algorithms and Data Structures: Design, Correctness and Analys
is by Jeffrey H. Kingston.                 
<br><br><br>

<!--
<b> Exercise 5</b> (removed from the tutorial exercises
because of time limitations):<br><br>


Formulate appropriate pre- and post-conditions and
prove that the following algorithm that adds the values in an array A[1..n] of integers is correct. <br><br>
function sum(A) <br>
s := 0 <br>
for i := 1 to n do s := s + A[i] <br>
return(s) <br><br>

Write a recursive algorithm that solves the same problem, and prove its 
correctness.
