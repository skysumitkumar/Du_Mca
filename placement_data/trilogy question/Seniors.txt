trilogy question :)

first interview

1)  an array of integer is given. (size N) now u have to find all the
 pairs whos sum is some value X.
   example a[2]=2
	   a[4]=3
	   x = 5
	   than ans should be 2,4
	array is not sorted and values are distinct.

some modifications
	i) sorted array is given.
	ii)dublicate values are allowed. 
	exp =>  a= {1,2,3,4,4,7,8,8}
	x=12
	ans = (4,7) (4,8) (5,7) (5,8) all possible combination

	please try to do first que in O(nlgn)
	
	after modification try to do it in O(n)
	memory should be constant O(1).

2)  a binary tree is give to u.... with node having -1 as values.....(
 all node have value -1)
    now u have to write a fuction which will assign values to these
 nodes such that it will satisfy
    the properties of a binary search tree.
    write down iterative and recursive function :)
    do not use static variable in the function.





second interview

1) write down a iterative code for inorder traversel.... parent pointer
 is not given...

2) write donw a recursive and iterative code for inorder traversel when
 parent pointer is given.
   O(n) time  and space complexity O(1).
	
   try to reduce code as much as possible. 



third interview

1) suppose u have a tree with node having values 1 to N.. no dublicate
 values...
   now an array is given to u which contain the value of parent node at
 index X. Parent node will be 
   parent node of node whose value is X.

   exp.. 
   let we have a tree with 3 node   parent value = 3
				 left child = 2   right child = 1

   now array will be like this..
      
    a[1] = 3        right child parent is node with value 3 
    a[2] = 3        left child parent is node with value 3
    a[3] = -1       no parent 

   now question is this

   u have this array... now u have to find the hight of the tree.... u
 can modify the values in this 
   array. try to do it in O(n) with space O(1).

2) u have a binary tree with 1 property... all child node will have
 have values less than its parent
   nodes. now an array is give.. it contain the inorder traversel of
 the given tree....
   now write a code to regenrate the tree again using the array....

 

fourth interview

1) there is an array of length N and it contain values between 1 to
 N-1.. only one value is repeated...
   now u have to find that value.... constant space and O(n) time
 complexity....
   
   modification => u can't make changes in the array...

2) u have a binary tree. find out whether it is a BST or not.. in O(n)
 with O(1) space.....






question from other people

1) post order of a binary tree is given.. regenrate the tree....
2) 2 linklist are given in sorted order now u have to create a new link
 list which will have only 
   those elements which are common in both link list. 
3) spiral printing of 2D array.... size could be any integer n,m
