 <h3>Algorithms and Data Structures (INF1, Autumn'03)</h3>
 <h2>Answers for Re-Exam Questions from 30.8.2004</h2>
<br>

<h3> Question 1</h3>
<ul>
<li> a) True, True, False, False 
<li> b) Yes, Yes
<li> c) G,H,D,E,B,F,C,A 
<li> d) T(n)=2n+3 
<li> e) 4,3,1,2,6 
<li> f) 2 
<li> h) nodes: A, B, C, D, edges: A->B, A->C, B->D, C->D, optionally
also A -> D 
<li> i) True, True, False
</ul>

<h3> Question 2 (sketch)</h3>

<UL>
<li>
a) easy; 
<li>
b) x:=s.pop; res:= x.value; s.push(x); return res <br>
Complexity is O(1).
<li> by using a temporary stack <br>
Complexity is O(n).
</ul>

<h3> Question 3 (sketch)</h3>
This is a graph problem. The ADT to chose is DIGRAPH. Cars are nodes
and the fact that car A has the same color as car B is represented
by two directed edges from A to B and from B to A.
<br><br>
To find the number of colours, go through the nodes and if the
node has not been visited, add 1 to the number of colours and
call depth first search from this node. Complexity is O(n+m)
where n is the number of nodes and m is the number of edges.
