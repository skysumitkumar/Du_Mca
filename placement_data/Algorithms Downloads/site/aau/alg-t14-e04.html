 <h2>Exercise Set 14</h2> <br> <br>

<b>Exercise 1:</b> <br><br>

Take a look at the following digraph. <br>

<UL>
<LI>  Construct the resulting table for Bellman-Moore algorithm.
Fill in also the column where k=n (see page 289 of the book).
<LI>  Does this digraph contain a negative cycle? Why yes/no? 
</UL>

<br><br>

<b>Exercise 2 (possible exam question from category 2!):</b> <br><br>

Solve Exercise 12.2 from the book (page 340). Assume that the input road map
is represented as a digraph (which is a result of replacing every edge
in a given graph by two edges of the same cost but in the oposite
direction) and use exclusively the operations
from DIGRAPH ADT to design a polynomial time algorithm.
Provide a detailed analysis of its worst-case time complexity. 
Be specific about what data structures you used.

<br><br><br>
<b>Exercise 3:</b> <br><br>


Professor <em>Konfus</em> once claimed:  <br><br>

"Dijkstra's algorithm works correctly even if the weight of the edges can
 be negative." <br><br>

Was he right? If yes, prove his claim. If not, give a counter example
and clear explanation why it is not the case.
