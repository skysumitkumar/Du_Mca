 <h3>Algorithms and Data Structures (INF1, Autumn'04)</h3>
 <h2>Exercise Set 1</h2>
<br>
<b>Exercise 1:</b> <br><br>

Write an equivalent algorithm without the use of goto. 
<br><br>
x:=1 <br>
1: x:=x*2 <br>
if (x<20) then goto 1 else x:=x+1 <br><br><br>


<b> Exercise 2:</b><br><br>

Consider the following problem. <br><br>

INPUT: A sequence S of natural numbers of length n, such that n>0
 (accessed by S[1], S[2], ..., S[n]). <br><br>

OUTPUT: The smallest and the largest element of S. <br><br><br>

<UL>

<LI> Describe a precise algorithm to solve this problem. <br><br>

<LI> What is the number of comparisons of your algorithm in the worst case?
     <br><br>

<LI> Does this number depend on the input sequence S?
</UL>
<br>

<b> Exercise 3 (hand-in, either individually or in pairs):</b><br><br>

Consider the following problem. <br><br>

INPUT: A sequence S of natural numbers of length n, such that n>0
 (accessed by S[1], S[2], ..., S[n]). <br><br>

OUTPUT: The second smallest element of S. <br><br><br>

<UL>

<LI> Describe a precise algorithm to solve this problem. <br><br>

<LI> What is the number of comparisons of your algorithm in the worst case?
     <br><br>
 
<LI> Does this number depend on the input sequence S? If not modify (improve)
     your algorithm such that it does. <br><br>

<LI> Try your algorithm on some examples (you do not have to write down
     this part) and for all natural numbers n find 
     a sequence S such that the algorithm performs the largest 
     number of comparisons on this sequence (write down the sequence
     and the number of comparisons).

</UL>
<br>


<b> Exercise 4:</b><br><br>

Consider the following problem. <br><br>

INPUT:
Let x and y be words over an alphabet of capital Roman
letters {A,B,C, ..., Z} of length n and m, respectively
such that n>m>0. Let us call x <em>text</em> and y <em>pattern</em>. <br><br>

OUTPUT: A number of occurrences of the pattern y in the text x. <br><br><br>

<UL>

<LI> Describe a precise algorithm to solve this problem. <br><br>

<LI> 
What is the number of comparisons of your algorithm in the worst case?
(I.e. given a text x of length n and a pattern y of length m,
what is the maximum number of comparisons among all possible
input words x and y of the length n and m, respectively?) <br><br>

<LI> 
For every n and m describe two words x and y of the given length such that
your algorithm run on these words performs the largest number of comparisons.

</UL>
To access the i'th letter of the word x and y use the syntax x[i] and y[i].
For example if x=ALGORITHM then n=9, x[1]=A, x[3]=G and x[n]=M. <br><br><br>
