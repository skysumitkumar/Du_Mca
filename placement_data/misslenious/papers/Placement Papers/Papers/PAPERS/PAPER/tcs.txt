answers are given as 1 , 6 , not compiled , machine dependent
answer is 6;
4) 
  another program apperas like this
main()
{ 
   int *x , y=2;
   int * fun(int* );
   x = (int *) malloc(sizeof(int));
   fun(x,&y);
   printf("%d%d",x,y);
}
  
int* fun(int *a, int *b)

    Regarding Interview:

   you should say everything confidentially, whatever you say tell them 
 frankly and confidentially i.e. I will do this, I will definetely learn
 within this period, now I am learning etc. regarding C-language, COBOL, etc.
   they will ask, how can you be best suited to our TCS (or soft ware field)?
  ans:   some of my seniors told that TCS is doing consultancy business in
 soft-ware field, this requires some sort of programming skills, knowledge of
 programming languages, in addition to this it requires a sort of aptitude
 skill  which I am sure of possing it, this I can say based on my past 
 academic ahcievements.     Also now I am learning C, I learned up to ....
 (say arrays or functions) I will go through Pointers etc. also I am learning
 COBOL, I am preparing for TCS  C, COBOL test.
  question: Why are you shifting from your mechanical field to software field?
  ans: I am interested in soft-ware field, because of its bright & prosperous
 future and quick recogniton of talent leading to faster growth.
  They will ask about your family members and you, you just simply answer
 the truth frankly, they donot bouther about your father occupation i.e business
 studies, etc.
   question: how can you compete with a computer background student as you 
             are a pure mechanical student?
    ans:  actually I have taken Fortran as one of my courses in B.Tech. degree
 course, now here in IIT I learned --------- languages( something about what
 you learned in IITB), initially I found slightly difficulty to compete with
 a student having computers background, but now I am confident of learning
 programming skills as once I am in the process of learning I am sure of
 achieving this.
        here we have first about family, then about 4 minutes talk on my project
 then they questioned on the project, then they asked about soft-ware i.e
 do you know about INTERNET, Y2K problem, etc. I frankly told that I donot know
 about INTERNET, I know a little bit about Y2K problem and explained about
 Y2K problem i.e now in all computers year is indicated by two digits only,
 finally after the 99th year (1999) the computer will treat as 00 year(1900)
 instead of considering it as 2000.   meanwhile one or two question on my
 academic record, about my refrigeration companies, etc.
     if you have a good topic on your project, you tell about that one and
 have a little knowledge on it so you can answer well their questions.
