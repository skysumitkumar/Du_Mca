Basically the paper was very easy and every one was able to perform well in it. Thus I don’t think it played a major role in the final selections. 
It was one-hour duration paper with 30 questions each on quant/aptitude and English.
There was no short listing on the basis of the written and all of us were invited for the GD.

Two groups were formed for the GD. The topics were
1)	does “kahin na kahin koi hai “ the sony serial on marriages reflects the true morse of Indian society
2)	should performance enhancing drugs be made legal in sports


8 students were short listed after the GD out of which three were selected finally,
There were two interviews a technical and a HR.
The technical interview was based on the projects u have mentioned in the cv and also ur areas of interest. The standard of interview was good. Two students were rejected on the basis of technical interview only. Others were called for the HR section.
The HR interview was very general.
