                -------------------------------------
                                                                                     
Practicing for the interview means practicing several behaviors
- not    just answering questions. You must dress well, watch
your body    language and posture, practice your manners and eye
contact as well as    practice answering questions correctly,
smoothly, and with confidence.  The practice questions below, in
one form or another, account for a    large percentage of
interview questions. With each question, you are    given a
series of choices as to how you might answer the question.
When you select an answer, you will learn whether your answer is
correct-and why. Answering these questions will help you polish
your   interviewing techniques. The questions and answers in
this excercise   are generic and, in many cases, must be
tailored to your individual   situation. Still, the logic behind
the answer remains essentially the   same.
   
Why are you the best person for the job?  I 've held a lot of
positions like this one, and that experience    will help me
here." "Because I am good at what I do."

"Our discussion here leads me to believe this is a good place to
work."

"You need someone who can produce results, and my background and
experience are proof of my ability. For example..."

If asked a point blank question such as: Are you creative? Are
you  analytical?    Can you work under pressure? etc. What is
the best way to    answer?

Face to Face Interview Preparation

So you have a job interview, NOW WHAT?

You have sent out hundreds of resumes and finally a Human
Resource person calls to schedule a time for you to come in for
a face to face interview.  This is a great company, and you
think you are perfect for the job.  Now, you must demonstrate
that to the hiring authority you are perfect for the position.

Here are some pointers to keep in mind when going in for the
interview.

Prepare - Do not go in attempting to "wing" it.  Keep in mind
there are lots of competitors for the job, and you will only
have this opportunity to impress the hiring authority.Research
and know the company, their history, products, services and
reputation.

Prepare answers to questions that will likely come up, like
"What is your biggest weakness?" "What is your greatest
failure?" "Describe your best and worse boss?" "Tell me
something about yourself?" "Why did you leave your last job?"
"How can you contribute to this company in this job?"

There will likely be a longer list of questions, each a
potential landmine that can eliminate you from the competition.
Keep your answers short and to the point.  Do not ramble.
Always be honest and avoid negative statements.  Wear your best
suit - The first impressions of a candidate are lasting.  It is
better to be over-dressed than under-dressed.  Your appearance
will demonstrate that you are taking the initiative.  Go out of
your way to make a good impression. Even if you never wear a
suit to work, even if it is a production job, the interviewer
will be pleased by your effort to impress.

Be on time - It is better for you to be early and wait for your
appointment time than to keep the interviewer waiting and
wondering.  If you miss your appointment time you may not get
another.  If a problem or emergency arises, and they do, call
immediately and explain and offer to come in at another time,
whenever is convenient for the interviewer.

Body language - Sit up, look attentive, do not cross your arms
or legs make eye contact.  Interviewers rely on body language to
determine your level of interest.

 Present a positive attitude - Companies seek pleasant and
positive people.

 Bring extra copies of your resume - You may interview with a
team of people, do not make them share one resume.

  Avoid smoking and drinking alcohol before and during an
interview.  If going to lunch with an interviewer, decline
alcholic beverages even if the interviewer orders a cocktail
with their meal.  If you are a smoker, abstain before and during
the interview.  Smoking can offend many people, even smoking
before an interview can leave an odor which may be offensive to
the interviewer.

 Do not lead with money or benefit questions in the initial
interview - If your main motivation is money it will probably
turn off most hiring authorities.  Convince them you can do the
job and want the job before discussing money and benefits.
Money, benefits and vacation will come up and can be discussed
should the company wish to make you an offer.

 Sell yourself - If you don't no one else will.  Use facts and
figures to quantify your experience and ability. Tell them the
things that will benefit the company if they hire you.

Show interest in the job - If you act cool they may not realize
that you want the job.  Companies want someone who is interested
and enthusiastic about the job and the company.  Don't make the
hiring authority guess if you want the job.

Do not close any do
