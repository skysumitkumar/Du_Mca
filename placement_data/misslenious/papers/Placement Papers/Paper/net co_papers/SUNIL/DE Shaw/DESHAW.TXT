   we cant able to reproduce them.:wq

1.while((*p++=*q++)!=0){}
   is equal to
expl: while((*p++=*q++)!='\0'){}
   a) b) c) d)

2.the function strcmp(str1,str2) returns
ans: int 

3. int   *x[](); means
expl: Elments of an array can't be functions.

4.#define  PRINT(int) printf("int=%d",int);
main()
{int x,y,z;
x=03;y=-1;z=01;
PRINT(x^x);
z<<=3;PRINT(x);   ----> I think here may be (z). for this ans=8.

}
                       expl: 0,8,-1  (if second is z)


5. struct list{
int x;
struct list *next;
}*head;
the struct head.x =100
 above is correct / wrong


expl: Before using the ptr type struct variable we have to give memory
 to that .
And also when ever the struct variable is ptr then we access the members
 by "->" operator.

 6. '-'=45  '/'=47
 printfr(%d/n,'-','-','-','-','/','/','/');
 o/p =?
                           ans: 45 ( i.e it takes first argument in 
								printf function.
                

 7.o/p=?
 int i;
 i=1;
 i=i+2*i++;

								over writes on same file.
										
						

10. int a=1, b=2, c=3, *pointer;
pointer=&c;
a=c/*pointer;
b=c;
printf("a=%d b=%d",a,b);
a. a=1 b=3
b a=3 b=3
c 3     2
d. error                           
							ans: d .  Because ";" indicates  competion
								of that statement. so It give error.

 			* Imp: And in above program   " a=c/*pointer " statement
					it considering as starting of comment statement.
                    So , It also causing for syntax error.

THIS PAPER HAS GIVEN IN IIT DELHI , SO GO THROUGH THIS IT WILL GIVE 
ROUGH IDEA;


1.   typedef struct{
	char *;
	nodeptr next;
	} * nodeptr;
what does nodeptr stand for?

2. supposing thaty each integer occupies 4 bytes and each charactrer 
1 byte , what is the output of the following programme?

#include<stdio.h>
main()
{
 int a[] ={ 1,2,3,4,5,6,7};
char c[] = {' a','x','h','o','k'};
printf("%d\t %d ", (&a[3]-&a[0]),(&c[3]-&c[0]));
}
ans : 3  3

3. what is the output of the program?

#include<stdio.h>
main()
{
struct s1 {int i; };
struct s2 {int i; };
struct s1 st1;
struct s2 st2;
st1.i =5;
st2 = st1;
printf(" %d " , st2.i);
}

ans: nothing  (error)
expl: diff struct variables should not assigned using "=" operator.



4.what is the output of the program?

#include<stdio.h>
main()
{
int i,j;
int mat[3][3] ={1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9};
for (i=2;i>=0;i--)
 for ( j=2;j>=0;j--)
printf("%d" , *(*(mat+j)+i));
}

ans : 9 6 3 8 5 2 7 4 1

5.

fun(n);
}
int fun( int n)
{
int i;
for(i=0;i<=n;i++)
fun(n-i);
printf(" well done");

}
 howmany times is the printf statement executed for n=10?


ans: zero
expl: Befire reaching to printf statement it will goes to infinite loop.


6.what is the output of the program?

main()
{
struct emp{
	char emp[];
	int empno;
	float sal;
};
struct emp member = { "TIGER"};
printf(" %d %f", member.empno,member.sal);


ans: error. In struct variable emp[], we have to give array size.
 If array size given
ans is 0, 0.00



7. output of the program?

	# define infiniteloop while(1)
	main()
	{
	infiniteloop;
	printf("DONE");
}

ans: none
expl: infiniteloop in main ends with ";" . so loop will not reach end;
and the DONE also will not print.

8.  output of the program?
	
main()
{
int a=2, b=3;
printf(" %d ", a+++b);
}

ans:5
expl: here it evaluates as a++ + b. 

9. output of the program?

#define prn(a) printf("%d",a)
#define print(a,b,c) prn(a), prn(b), prn(c)
#define max(a,b)  (a<b)? b:a

main()
{
int x=1, y=2;
print(max(x++,y),x,y);
print(max(x++,y),x,y);
}


ans: 3 4 2

10. which of the following is the correct declaration for the function main() ?

ans: main( int , char *[])

11. if ptr is defined as

	int *ptr[][100];
	which of the following correctly allocates memory for ptr?

ans: ptr = (int *)(malloc(100* sizeof(int));
