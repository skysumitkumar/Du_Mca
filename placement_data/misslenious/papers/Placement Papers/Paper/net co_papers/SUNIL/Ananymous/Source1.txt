     L - xL/6 =  2(L - xL/4)
=>  x=3
2        x         x+27
        x =( x+27)/2       =>     x  = 27
3.  distance = x
                           x/40 + 10   =    x/30   + 16

                            x/40 - x/30 = 6  =>  x = 720 kms

5.  24 officers > 25 years

     19 married >  25     => 7M
     25 males   >  25   =>  5 M U M

10.
      15 * 12 = 180

11.       3* 50 = 150  =>  180 - 150 = 30

12.      x-1    x    x+1

    ( x*x - 1 ) * x =  x*x*x - x = 120  =>  x = 6
