as far as aptitude paper is concern it is simple one .
reasoning is that comes in entrance exam there are two cities a & 
b,there are three types of comunication (train ,bus...)having some 
cost assosiated u have to choose the best alternative .as i told 
earlier to u that they are typically from gre(barrons) which 
sanmacs had given.
as far as aptitude is plesse do series, time &distance,ratio 
propotion.


it is not having the aptitude
