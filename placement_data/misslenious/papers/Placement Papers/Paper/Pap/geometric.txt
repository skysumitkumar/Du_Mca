			I am sending mainly c paper and some questions.Rao
also will send somethig.There are 15 c q's all are discriptive.

1)fallacy  
f()
{
int a;
void c;f2(&c,&a);
2)a=0;
b=(a=0)?2:3;
a) What will be the value of b? why
b) If in 1st stmt a=0 is replaced by -1, b=?
c) If in second stmt a=0 is replaced by -1, b=?
3)char *a[2]
int const *p;
int *const p;
struct new { int a;int b; *var[5] (struct new)
4)f()
{
int a=2;
f1(a++);
}
f1(int c)
{
printf("%d", c);
}
c=?
5)f1()
{
f(3);}
f(int t)
{
switch(t);
{
case 2: c=3;
case 3: c=4;
case 4: c=5;
case 5: c=6;
default: c=0;}
value of c?
6)Fallacy
int *f1()
{
int a=5;
return &a;
}
f()
int *b=f1()
int c=*b;
}
7)a)Function returning an int pointer
b)Function ptr returning an int ptr
c)Function ptr returning an array of integers
d)array of function ptr returning an array of integers
(See Scham series book)
8)fallacy 
int a;
short b;
b=a;
9)Define function ?Explain about arguments?
10)C passes  By value or By reference?
11)Post processed code for 
abc=1;
b=abc1; (1 or 2 blank lines are given)

at each code, return function of all the nodes in binary tree.(Study)Check
15)Calling refernce draw the diagram of function stack illustrating the
variables in the -----then were pushed on the stack at the point when
function f2 has been introduced 
type def struct
{ double x,double y} point;
main( int argc, char *arg[3])

int b,c;
f1(a,b);}
f1(double x, int y)
{
point p;
stack int n;
f2(p,x,y)}
f2(point p, double angle)
{ int i,j,k,int max)
}
_____________________________________________________________

.............................................................................


I donot know paper before giving GSSL. But for your purpose only I 
recollected all questions. But C language paper Sekhar babu will send 
today afternoon.  Otherwise I will send today before 8:00p.m.  Best of luck.

C language is some what tough. 15 questions are there. 

You solve these questions.and check mails frequently I will definitely 
send C language paper today itself,

In interviewthey will ask about graphics i.e. about curves, prove sum of 
the angles in triangle is 180

About MTP

If we draw a triangle in a circle prove that angle is 90 degrees.
