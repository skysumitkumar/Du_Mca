So here Iam giving flow chart answersin sequence.  These answers are
perfectly in sequence,donot worry, youcan keep these answers blindly.

There are 7 flow charts we know only 6 flow charts answers.

Donot thinkabout these answers are correct or not , these are 100%
correct.  We tested here.

1.     D    B    A  E   C

2.	D   E C E  C


3. C  B D  B  D

4. D B  D C B

5. C E A D E
6. B C D A D


In hurry, I typed. Please cooperative.


Model :

Section 1  synonyms :  

section 2 numerical ability :   26questions 8min

section 3 letter series : 26 questions 10min

section 4 reasoning type : 14 questions 20min

setion 5 flow charts : 7 questions 35min


Each sectionis having separate time. I could not complete letter series,
numerical ability questions in time. Flow chartssection i kept within 5
min afterwards I cam back. If they see I will fuck you.  So be care.


Group discussion topics:

1. Brain drain: i.e. related to why immigration to U.S; I opposed
partially and supported partially

2. Electronic media effect;  Internet, TV ,Email multimedia

	G.D they won't eliminate so many people.  but you have participate
with enthusiasm.You talk something. Interview as usual, stereoscopic
questions.like TCS. 


	I went upto interview, afterwards out.


BEST OF LUCK.  If you want any help always welcome.

A.V.Rao

 I am adding some question which are not above. these question are
regarding flowcharts.
Instrctions:
1) There are 7 flow charts & each has 5-6 blank rectangles/diamonds with
subquestion no. in rectangle/diamond. you have to fill the blank from the
5 options given against respective question no.
2) You have to understand the logic & then it is very easy to fill the
blanks.
3) they had provided some information which you have to use for getting
answers.
Flow charts:
1) there are 3 boxes of 3 balls each. you have to select the heaviest
among all.  
        
         <select box 1&2>
               |
         <is wt.1=wt.2>--No----(is wt1 > wt.2)--No--(select box2)
               |                       |                         |
              Yes                    Yes                         |
               |                        |                        |
         select box 3            select box 1                    |
               |                        |                        |  
               |------------------------|------------------------|      
               |
        select two balls
                |
         is wt.ball.1 = wt.ball.2 --- No --  is wt.ball.1> wt.ball.2 -- No
                |                                      |                |
               Yes                                     Yes              |
                |                                       |           ball.2
            ball.3 is                                  ball.1 is     is
             heaviest                                  heaviest     heavist

 so there will be some blank in this flow chart and u have to fill up the 
blanck with correct option. 


Q2)
    there are red and black balls. if ball is red then one point. if
ball is black and previous ball is red then two points. For winning u  
have to get seven points. No point for same color consecutive balls.  
   
        |----------- select ball
        |               |
        |           is ball red ---  Yes --  Is previous --No---   
        |                              |         ball red
        |               No           p=p+1        |
        |               |                         No 
        |            is previous                  |
        |             ball black --No----------- p=p+2  --count= count+1
        |                 |                                |      
        |                Yes                         |---is ball left   
        |                 |                          |       |  
        |              No point                    Yes       No 
        |                                            |       |
        |                                            |        end
        |--------------------------------------------               



Q3)
        Classify objects in class A, class B and scrap. for classfing u
have to do  diffrent test such as weight, material etc. and Flow char for
this ques. will be there along with some blanks.


Q4)
     There is production process in which action depend on temprature and
pressure. and there are temp. and press. controls.     


Q5)
      find max. and min. of the  12 nos. there will array and u have to
arrange the numbers in assending/ descending order and find out max. and
min.

Q6)
     diffrent age group are given and also diffrent salary slabs are
given.  so depending on the salary group as well as his group u have to
fill the person in particular class. (ques. is not in exact form.) 

one ques.  do not remember.

So here Iam giving flow chart answersin sequence.  These answers are
perfectly in sequence,donot worry, youcan keep these answers blindly.

There are 7 flow charts we know only 6 flow charts answers.

Donot thinkabout these answers are correct or not , these are 100%
correct.  We tested here.
but check it the test also

this is the ans of flow chart.
