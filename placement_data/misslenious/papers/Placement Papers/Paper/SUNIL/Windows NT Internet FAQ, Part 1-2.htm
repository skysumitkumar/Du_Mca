Q2-2:  Which Internet books are recommended for a Internet beginner?

	Ed Krol, "The Whole Internet User's Guide &amp; Catalog"

==============================================================================

Q2-3:  Can I have Linux and NT installed on the same pc?


Thanks to Mark Cooke (<A href="mailto:ee2015@mail.bristol.ac.uk">ee2015@mail.bristol.ac.uk</A>) for the following
answer.

You can use LILO with the linux partition active
in the superblock instead of the MBR.  Using LILO
you can choose between DOS/NT and Linux.  Then I
use NT's boot manager to choose between Dos and NT.

Installed Dos first, then Linux, and then NT.

==============================================================================

Q2-4:  Where can I find the GNU binaries for NT?

<A href="ftp://ftp.cc.utexas.edu/microlib/nt/gnu">ftp://ftp.cc.utexas.edu/microlib/nt/gnu</A>

==============================================================================

Q2-5:  Where is the port of GNU gcc to NT? Is it version 2.6.+ ?

You can ftp  gcc-2.6.0  from  ftp.cs.yale.edu /pub/gnat
(This release includes both the C and Ada front ends. There is
also a .hlp file for gcc in MS-HELP format)

==============================================================================
SECTION 3: Connectivity Hardware
==============================================================================

Q3-1:  Where can I locate the latest Microsoft Windows NT 3.5
hardware compatibility list?

==============================================================================

Q3-3:  What is the recommended modem.inf entry for USR 28.8 modems?

Thanks to Christopher Browne (<A href="mailto:cbrowne@usr.com">cbrowne@usr.com</A>) at USR for the
recommended MODEM.INF for various USR modems.

This is the .INF as we have it now. It's been tested on NT 3.1 / 3.5
andWfW 3.11 with great success. I've been able to use all of our
modems from the Courier v.34 down to the Sportster 9600 data/fax.

The MAXCONNECTBPS is set at 38400 so that this file works with most
of the installed base of modems. We only started supporting &gt; 57600
with the Courier V.32t.

The MAXCARRIERBPS is set but any dce-dce rate that is reported at
connect isignored since the port is locked. The first release of
this file was in error since it did not contain the &amp;B1 command
and this caused considerable pain for a few folks. My apologies!

Using ITU-T as our default allows a USR modem to connect with more
than USR modems at higher dce rates. This can be changed runtime by
the user either through the phone number "123-123-1234B0" or by
changing the INF file. I would prefer to see the phone number used
so that the modem stays in a more compatible mode by default.

; For use with Windows for Workgroups, NT 3.1, NT 3.5

"Personal Internet Access Using SLIPP or PPP: How You Use It,
How it Works" by Frank Hecker
FTP//ftp.digex.net/pub/access/hecker/internet/slip-ppp.txt

==============================================================================

Q4-2:  Where do I find SLIP/PPP for NT?  How do I install SLIP/PPP for NT?


A.)  Double click on the Main program group
B.)  Double click on Network
C.)  Click on add software
D.)  Choose Remote Access Service

==============================================================================

Q4-3:  Help: My RAS PPP/SLIP connection is not working?

You probably have one of three problems either the slip link is not
working, or your NT system is not accessing the UNIX service DNS,
or the IP routing is messed up between your NT system and your slip
providers UNIX network.

1.) Can you ping any addresses on the other end of the slip or ppp
link?  Try pinging the UNIX server or the gateway. Drop to DOS and
use the ping command. Use the numeric IP address.

2.) Try turning VJ compression off.  Sometimes telnet and FTP will
not work if you have VJ compression on and the system you are
connected to does not support VJ compression.  If you are using
TIA be sure and set the NT option for VJ compression to off.
Since, TIA does not support VJ compression.

3.) Check and confirm that the following are correct:
Double click on the Main program group icon, then double click on
the Control Panel icon, then double click on Network icon, select
the TCP/IP protocol and click on the configure button.  Click on

DNS and verify the following is correct:

A.)  The Host Name for your PC
B.)  Your Domain Name
C.)  Add the proper DNS IP address or addresses for your slip/ppp
     service.

Click on OK to confirm DNS changes
Click on OK to close out the TCP configuration dialog.
Click on OK to close the Network configuration dialog.

If you are not sure please ask slip/ppp service providers system
admin. to confirm them for you.

4.) Drop the baud rate to 9600, some UARTs do not work above 9600
without UART receiver overruns.

5.) Finally try finding someone else who is using NT slip or ppp
at your location.  Ask the system admin. if anyone else is
successfully running NT via slip or ppp.

6.) Can you dial in using slip or ppp from a known working system
using your username and password?

7.) Are you using dynamic IP addressing (bootp)?

With slip you will have to manually login using Rasphone and
then type your IP into the little white box at the lower right
side of the screen and click on the DONE button.  For PPP you
can automate the login follow the directions under question no.
27 below.  Also a NT workstation using RAS to dial into a NT
server will work with dynamic IP if the NT server is configured
for DHCP.

8.) Are you using a static IP address?

The first time you dial in using the RAS SLIPP use the manual
login option, you will get a screen a 0.0.0.0 IP address displayed
in a white box at the bottom of the screen.  Type in your assigned
SLIP IP address and click on the DONE button.  The IP address will
be written into the rasphone.pbk as the SlipIpAddress=NNN.NNN.NNN.NNN
entry under the currently active selection in the rasphone.pbk file
located in the /winnt35/system32/ras directory.


9.) After you dial in and login in shell out to does and see what
the netstat -rn utility shows.

My netstat -rn returned the following info after my slip link is
connected.  My IP address is 198.60.143.32 and my slip service
providers gateway is 168.158.8.5

Network Address Netmask		Gateway Address Interface    Metric
0.0.0.0		0.0.0.0		198.60.143.32	198.60.143.32   1

==============================================================================

Q4-4:  Where can I find a UUCP implementation for NT?

	You'll find UUCP on ftp.cica.indiana.edu

==============================================================================
SUBSECTION 4A: Server
==============================================================================

Q4A-1:  Does 3.5's RAS support dynamic ip addressing?

Yes NTAS V3.5 allows you to setup up a range of address that
the remote ras clients can request. This is called dynamic addressing
or bootp.  and it works.  The NTAS server is configured as a DHCP server.
When the remote pc calls in via RAS and is authenticated the NTAS server
assigns the remote pc an IP from the pool of unused IP addresses.

==============================================================================

Q4A-2:  If a remote user dials into a NT 3.5 PPP server, will this person
be able to

A.)  Use File Manager or Net Use commands to access NetBIOS-based shared
drives?

Yes, if the remote user is using NT Workstation V3.5 or WFWG V3.1 RAS.

No, if the remote user is using most third party PPP implementations
such as Chameleon TCP/IP, Spry Air Series 3.0, and Trumpet SLIP/PPP
Winsock.  Most of the third party TCP/IP software packages do not
support NETBIOS SMB over a remote slip/ppp connection.


B.)  Use a POP mail client to connect to a POP server?


Yes, if the remote user is using NT Workstation V3.5 and RAS PPP
with the TCP/IP option enabled on both ends of the RAS link.

Eudora email works great with NT V3.5 for SMTP and POP3
<A href="ftp://ftp.qualcomm.com/quest/eudora/windows/1.4/beta">ftp://ftp.qualcomm.com/quest/eudora/windows/1.4/beta</A>
filename eud143b4.exe

No, if the remote user is using WFWG V3.1 RAS.  The WFWG RAS does
not support PPP and TCP/IP.  WFWG V3.1 RAS supports NETBEUI only.

Q4A-3:  Where can I get DNS for NT?

The Windows NT 3.5 resource kit is supposed to include a DNS software
package, there is also a third  party product called 'DNS Magic' that
runs as a NT Service, company is 'Software Innovations'
(winnt#innov.com)

Q4B-1:  Where do I configure the RAS TCP/IP settings for PPP connections?


Thanks to Tom Horsley (<A href="mailto:Tom.Horsley@mail.csd.harris.com">Tom.Horsley@mail.csd.harris.com</A>) for his
suggestion of configuring PPP from the Rasphone.

Instead of configuring PPP starting from the Network entry on the
control panel, I find that I can configure those details
from the RAS program's phonebook in the Advanced edit dialog. This
actually makes perfect sense because the details are likely to be
different for each phone number.


For PPP you can configure the TCP/IP settings as follows:

Double click on the Remote Access icon.
Highlight the proper entry then click on the EDIT button.
Click on Advanced if set to Basic.
Click on Network button (Displays the Network Protocol Settings Dialog)
Check the PPP option.
Click on TCP/IP Settings
If using dynamic IP addresses, check "Use server assigned IP addresses".
If using a static IP address, check "Require specific IP address" and
fill in your assigned address.

and enter the primary and backup DNS IP addresses.  The
backup DNS is optional.

If your provider supports compressed ppp, check Use VJ compression.
and also check the use default gateway on remote network.

==============================================================================

Q4B-2:  Where do I configure the TCP/IP settings for SLIP connections?

Double click on the Main program group icon, then double click on
the Control Panel icon, then double click on Network icon, select
the TCP/IP protocol and click on the configure button.  Click on

DNS and verify the following is correct:

A.)  The Host Name for your PC
B.)  Your Domain Name
C.)  Add the proper DNS IP address or addresses for your slip/ppp
     service.

Click on OK to confirm DNS changes
Click on OK to close out the TCP configuration dialog.
Click on OK to close the Network configuration dialog.

NOTE: You will have to setup Rasphone to manually dial the first time you
make a slip connection.  Set the security options to "Use clear text
Terminal login only", and set the Before and After Scripts to NONE.  Then
select/highlight your entry and click on Dial. You will manually login
the first time you dialup for the slip connection, after the valid login
using your username and password type slip&lt;cr&gt; at the remote servers
command prompt, then type your IP into the little white box at the
lower right side of the screen and click on the DONE button.

Q4B-3:  Example login scripts for various Internet providers


Example login script for MCS.Net in Chicago

Macro Computer Solutions (MCS-DOM)

Denninger, Karl  <A href="mailto:karl@MCS.NET">karl@MCS.NET</A>
   	
substitute your username and password in place of the USERNAME
and PASSWORD The MCS net server uses the commands login and
password; if your's uses different words, substitute as needed.


Here's the MCS.NET script thanks to Walter S. Arnold

with both PPP and Slip.

==============================================================================

Q4B-4:  How do I automate my slip/ppp login using the switch.inf
script language?

You will need to edit the switch.inf file in winnt35/system32/ras
and add an entry for your slip/ppp login script.  The section you
add must have a label followed by your actual script commands.
Reference the rasphone.hlp help file and the pad.inf file in
winnt35/system32/ras for additional information.
The Microsoft NT V3.5 resource kit (when it is released) will
have additional documentation on the switch.inf file and the
script language.

The switch.inf script is as follows:

Substitute your USERNAME, PASSWORD, and IP Address

Note, this script will need to be modified to match your slip
providers login sequence.

Q4B-5:  How do I avoid having to click on the DONE button to complete the
slip/ppp connect when using rasphone?

I wrote two batch files for using rasdial and it worked great!
The first rasdial batch file is for initiating the connection.
I then added to icons one for calling the startnet.bat and one
for calling the stopnet.bat, you can use the open door icon for
startnet and the close door icon for stopnet.  Place these batch
files in the winnt directory so they are in the Win NT path.
Type path at the command prompt for path details.  You can get
the command line options for rasdial by typing

rasdial /help

The startnet.bat file contains one line as follows:

rasdial evergreen

and the stopnet.bat file contains one line as follows:

rasdial evergreen /DISCONNECT

Q4B-6:  How do I bypass my slip/ppp service providers long banner text
in the script language?

The following is one method submitted by (Chris Pirih)
<A href="mailto:pirih@eskimo.com">pirih@eskimo.com</A>

Chris indicates that a better way to do this is as follows:

        COMMAND=mypassword&lt;cr&gt;
        OK=&lt;match&gt;"unity%"
        LOOP=&lt;ignore&gt;&lt;cr&gt;
        COMMAND=ppp&lt;cr&gt;

The following is a second method submitted by Jason John Schwarz
(<A href="mailto:jschwarz@gandalf.ksmith.com">jschwarz@gandalf.ksmith.com</A>)

For the following example:

OK for those other people who's host sends long strings of stuff
when they initially login here is a fix, I admit it is not pretty,
and if somebody has a better one I would like to see it, but this
works at my site, and it seems to be the only thing that does work.

Q4B-7:  Does anyone know how to put in a delay in switch.inf scripts?

Our Shiva system requires about 10 seconds to initialize before
starting PPP.

Try repeating the following script commands five times in your login
script.

; The next line will give a delay of 2 secs

COMMAND=
NoResponse

==============================================================================

Q4B-8:  How do I get dynamic IP working for slip or ppp?

I do not have the dynamic IP working for SLIP connections.
This is because I do not know how to parse the IP and then transfer
the dynamically assigned IP to the proper RAS variable.  I asked
Microsoft for additional information on the script language and I
was told that the NT 3.5 resource kit is supposed to have
additional documentation on the switch.inf script language but it
is not released yet (supposed to be released soon).

SLIP with dynamic IP

You will have to interactively logon to a SLIP server by manually
entering name, password, and "slip" to enter slip mode and recieve
the dynamic IP address. I copied the address to the address box in
the RAS terminal IP address box. Don't forget to enter the DNS IP
addressby configuring TCP/IP ( control panel \ network \ advanced \
enable DNS &amp; DNS... ).  Scripting
examples are included in other sections of this FAQ.


After searching for where rasphone stuck my IP address, and I
found it in the rasphone.pbk entry.

The first time I ran the SLIP login script via Rasphone book
entry I got a screen with a DONE button and the 0.0.0.0 IP


address was in a white box at the bottom of the screen.  I typed
in my SLIP static IP address and clicked on the DONE button.
This then was written into the rasphone.pbk as the
SlipIpAddress=198.60.143.32 entry in the Evergreen section of
the rasphone.pbk file in /winnt35/system32/ras
