1.whenever you create the jsp first time then it convert it to servlet so it take some time to do that so servlet run faster than jsp
2.It is recommended that don't write you business logic into jsp(actual java code)
  jsp is only for view
  using html you can only create static page but with jsp we can use dynamic page
