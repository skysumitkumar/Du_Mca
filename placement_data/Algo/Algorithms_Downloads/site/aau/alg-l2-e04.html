 <h3>Algorithms and Data Structures (INF1, Autumn'04)</h3>
 <h2>Lecture 2</h2>
<br>
<b>Main topic:</b> Correctness of algorithms. 
<h3> Lecture Plan</h3>
<ul>
<li> partial correctness, total correctness
<li> pre- and post-conditions
<li> recursion vs. iteration
<li> mathematical induction
<li> assertions, invariants 
<li> examples 
</ul>
<h3> Reading</h3>
<ul>
<li> Pseudocode appendix from: Discrete Mathematics and its
Applications (available in the course folder for photocopying).
<b>Only a few pages worth reading!</b>
<li> Chapter 1 of Algorithms and Data Structures: 
Design, Correctness and Analysis by Jeffrey H. Kingston
[Note: Page 10 can be safely skipped as it gives some details of
 a correctness argument that we won't need.] 
Appendix A (less than three pages!) tells you all you need to know to read 
the Eiffel code used in the book. 
<li> 
     Chapter 5 of Algorithmics: The Spirit of Computing by David Harel
     (available in the course folder for photocopying)
</ul>
