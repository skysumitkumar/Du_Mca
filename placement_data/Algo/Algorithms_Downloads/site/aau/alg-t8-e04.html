 <h2>Exercise Set 8</h2>
<br>
<b>Exercise 1:</b> <br><br>
In this exercise the square (nil) nodes in a binary tree are not
considered (counted) and the values stored in the nodes are irrelevant.

<UL>
<LI> List all binary trees with 3 nodes. 
<LI> Find a binary tree with 7 nodes with the longest path from
     the root to some leaf.
<LI> Find a binary tree with 7 nodes such that the longest path from 
     the root to some of the leaves has minimal length.
<LI> Find a binary tree with 9 nodes such that every node which is
     not a leaf has exactly two children.
</UL>
<br>
<b>Exercise 2:</b> <br><br>

Let t be a binary tree.

<UL>
<LI>
Using only the operations of the ADT binary tree write a function
<b>no_leaves(x:ENTRY_TYPE):int</b> which returns the number of
leaves in the subtree of t rooted by the node x. The tree t
should not be modified.
<LI> What is the worst case complexity of the call no_leaves(t.root) 
 where the size of the input (number of nodes in t) is denoted
 by |t|?
</UL>
<br>

<b>Exercise 3 (hand-in):</b> <br><br>

Consider a binary tree at the very top of page 110 in the book.
<ul>
<li> Write the sequence of visited nodes in preorder traversal.
<li> Write the sequence of visited nodes in inorder traversal.
<li> Write the sequence of visited nodes in postorder traversal.
</ul>
<br> 

<b>Exercise 4 (hand-in):</b> <br><br>

Professor <em>Konfus</em> once claimed: <br><br>
"inorder traversal of a binary tree always visits a leaf as the first node".
<br><br>
Was he right? If yes, prove his claim. If not, give a counter example.
<br><br><br>

<b>Exercise 5:</b> <br><br>

What is the worst-case time complexity of preorder(t.root), inorder(t.root)
and postorder(t.root) assuming that visit(x) takes 

<UL>
<LI> O(1) time?
<LI> O(|t|) time?
<LI> O(|t|<SUP>2</SUP>*log |t|) time?
</UL>
