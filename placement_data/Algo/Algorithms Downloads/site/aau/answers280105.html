 <h3>Algorithms and Data Structures (INF1, Autumn'04)</h3>
 <h2>Answers for Exam Questions from 28.1.2004</h2>
<br>

<h3> Question 1</h3>
<ul>
<li> a) False, True, True 
<li> b) No, Yes
<li> c) G, D, B, E, A, C, F, H 
<li> d) O(n<sup>2</sup>) and O(n<sup>3</sup>)
<li> e) 3, 2, 1
<li> f) A is an isolated node and there is an edge from B to C
<li> g) 1st column: 0, 8, 6, infinity; 2nd column: 0, 7, 6, 4;
        3rd column: 0, 1, 6, 4  
</ul>

<h3> Question 2 (sketch)</h3>

<UL>
<li> a) s1.make; s1.insert(3); s1.insert(2); s1.insert(5);  <br>
s1.delete_min returns 2
<li> b) remove in loop one minimal element from s1 and one from s2 and compare
if they are the same; if both s1 and s2 become empty at the same time
and all the removed numbers were the same, return TRUE, otherwise return FALSE
<li> c) all are O(1) except for delete_min which is O(n)
<li> d) first insert all elements from A to a temporary MIN_SET and then
remove one by one elements from MIN_SET and insert them in this order into A.
The elements in A has to be all different. Using singly-linked list the
complexity is O(n<sup>2</sup>), using Fibonacci heaps it is O(n * log n).
</UL>

<h3> Question 3 (sketch)</h3>

This is a minimum spanning tree problem.
<UL>
<li> a) yes, there is another solution with the same total cost
<li> b) the problem is a graph problem with undirected edges, the question
is to find a minimum spanning tree
<li> c) e.g. by using Kruskal's algorithm, complexity is O(m * log n)  
<li> d) e.g. by modifying Kruskal's algorithm, first order the edges in such
a way that they start with the links that are already built (and these
edges are ordered) and then continues with the other edges (and these
are again ordered). Do not include any edge which cannot be in the
graph due to incompatibility. Finally run Kruskal's algorithm which 
processes the edges in this order.
</UL>
