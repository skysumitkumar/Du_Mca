 <h2>Exercise Set 9</h2> <br> <br>


<b>Exercise 1:</b> <br><br>

<UL>
<LI>
Give appropriate pre- and post- conditions for the operation 
<b>retrieve(key:KEY_TYPE):ENTRY_TYPE</b> from the symbol table ADT.
Make sure that the symbol table is not modified.
<LI>
Discuss the operation <b>retrieve</b> in the singly linked list
implementation of the symbol table ADT (showed at the lecture).
<LI>
Improve your implementation such that it uses <em>Move-to-Front</em>
heuristics. Is your implementation still totally correct with regard 
to the pre- and post- conditions you suggested above?
</UL>
<br><br>

<b>Exercise 2 (hand-in):</b> <br><br>

Consider the following sequence of operations on a symbol
table <b>s</b> using the binary search tree implementation
from the lecture.
<br><br>
s.make <br>
s.insert(s.new_entry(4,"Peter")); <br>
s.insert(s.new_entry(2,"Jan")); <br>
s.insert(s.new_entry(7,"Peter")); <br>
s.insert(s.new_entry(5,"Jiri")); <br>
s.insert(s.new_entry(6,"Anna")); <br>
s.insert(s.new_entry(8,"Peter")); <br> <br>

<UL>
<LI>
Draw the resulting binary search tree including the
keys and values stored in the nodes.
</UL>
<br><br>

<b>Exercise 3:</b> <br><br>

Consider binary search trees as defined at the lecture.

<UL>
<LI> 
Implement a (recursive) algorithm
<b>print(x:ENTRY_TYPE,a:KEY_TYPE,b:KEY_TYPE)</b> 
such that if t is a binary search tree and a < b then
print(t.root,a,b) prints the values of all entries
which have the key in the interval [a,b].
(Hint: use inorder traversal).
<LI> Discuss the worst-case time complexity of your algorithm.
Does it depend on the number of printed values?
<LI> Try to improve your algorithm such that you do not
have to visit all the nodes in the tree when printing only a few
values.
</UL>

<br><br><br>
<b>Exercise 4:</b> <br><br>

Draw all binary search trees with exactly three nodes that
store the keys 4, 7 and 8. The values stored in the nodes
are irrelevant.
