<h1>Truth and Lie<br />(Logic Problems)</h1>

<div class="clear-both"></div>

<h2>Honestants and Swindlecants I.</h2>
<p>
These are typical logic problems which can be solved by using classic logic operations.<br />
There live two kinds of people on a mysterious island. There are so called Honestants who speak always the truth, and the others are Swindlecants who always lie in everyone's throat.<br />
Three fellows (A, B and C) are having a quarrel at the market. A gringo goes by and asks the A fellow: "Are you an Honestant or a Swindlecant?" The answer is incomprehensible so the gringo asks B: "What did A say?" B answers: "A said that he is a Swindlecant." And to that says the fellow C: "Do not believe B, he is lying!" Who is B and C?
</p>

<h2>Honestants and Swindlecants II.</h2>
<p>
Afterwards he meets another two aborigines. One says: "I am a Swindlecant or the other one is an Honestant." Who are they?
</p>

<h2>Honestants and Swindlecants III.</h2>
<p>
Our gringo displeased the sovereign with his intrusive questions and was condemned to death. But there was also a generous chance of saving himself. The gringo was shown two doors - one leading to scaffold and the second one to freedom (both
doors were the same) and only door guards knew what was behind the doors. The sovereign let the gringo put one question to one guard. And because the sovereign was an honest man he warned that exactly one guard is a Swindlecant.<br />
What question can save the gringo's life?
</p>

<h2>Honestants and Swindlecants IV.</h2>
<p>
Our gringo was lucky and survived. On his way to the pub he met three aborigines. One made this statement: "We are all Swindlecants." The second one concluded: "Just one of us is an honest man." Who are they?
</p>

<h2>Honestants and Swindlecants V.</h2>
<p>
In the pub the gringo met a funny guy who said: "If my wife is an Honestant, then I am Swindlecant." Who is this couple?
</p>

<h2>Honestants and Swindlecants VI.</h2>
<p>
When the gringo wanted to pay and leave the pub, the bartender told him how much his drink costed. It was quite much money, so he asked the bartender if he speaks the truth. But the gringo did not hear the whispered answer so he asked a man sitting next to him about it. And the man said: "The bartender said yes, but he is a big liar." Who are they?
</p>

<h2>Honestants and Swindlecants VII.</h2>
<p>
Going out of the pub, the gringo heard about a fantastic buried treasure. He wanted to be sure so he asked another man who replied:<br />
"What, on this island is a treasure, only if I am an honest man."<br />
So shall he go and find the treasure?
</p>

<h2>Honestants and Swindlecants VIII.</h2>
<p>
Thinking about the treasure, the gringo forgot what a day it was, so he asked four aborigines and got these answers:<br />
A: Yesterday was Wednesday.<br />
B: Tomorrow will be Sunday.<br />
C: Today is Friday.<br />
D: The day before yesterday was Thursday.<br />
Because everything you need to know is how many people lied, I will not tell. What day in week was it?
</p>

<h2>Honestants and Swindlecants IX.</h2>
<p>
After a hard day the gringo wanted some time to relax. But  a few minutes later two aborigines wanted to talk to him. To make things clear, the gringo asked: &quot;Is at least one of you an honestant?&quot; After the answer, there was no doubt. Who are they and who answered?
</p>

<h2>Honestants and Swindlecants X.</h2>
<p>
There was a girl on this island, and everybody wanted her. However, she wanted just a rich swindlecant. If you were a rich swindlecant, how would you convince her saying only one sentence. And what if she wanted a rich honestant (and if you were one). Let us assume that there are only rich or poor people on that island.
</p>

<br />

<h2>At the Court I.</h2>
<p>
And now a few cases from the island of honestants and swindlecants. A prisoner at the bar was allowed to say one sentence to defend himself. After a while he said: &quot;A swindlecant committed the crime.&quot; Did it rescue him?
</p>

<h2>At the Court II.</h2>
<p>
Two truthful lawyers had the following conversation.<br />
Plaintiff: "If the prisoner is guilty, then he had an accomplice."<br />
Solicitor: "That's not truth!"<br />
Did the solicitor help his client?
</p>

<h2>At the Court III.</h2>
<p>
This time you are one of inhabitants of the island. There was committed a crime and people think you did it. At the court you can say only one sentence to rescue your life. So what do you say?
</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you were a swindlecant (the court does not know that) and you were innocent. It is known that a swindlecant did it.</li>
  <li>The same situation but you are guilty.</li>
  <li>If you were an honestant (the court does not know that) and you were innocent. It is known that an honestant did it.</li>
  <li>If you were innocent and everybody knows that the one who did it is not normal. Normal people sometimes lie and sometimes speak the truth. What sentence, no matter if you were an honestant, a swindlecant or normal can prove your    innocence?</li>
</ul>

<br />

<h2>Pandora's Box I.</h2>
<p>
Once upon a time, there was a girl named Pandora, who wanted a bright groom so she made up a few logic problems for the wannabe. This is one of them.<br />
Based upon the inscriptions on the boxes, choose one box where the wedding ring is hidden.
</p>

<div class="box">
<div>Golden box</div>
<div class="bonmot">The ring is in this box.</div>
</div>
<div class="box">
<div>Silver box</div>
<div class="bonmot">The ring is not in this box.</div>
</div>
<div class="box">
<div>Lead box</div>
<div class="bonmot">The ring is not in the golden box.</div>
</div>
<br class="clear-both" />

<h2>Pandora's Box II.</h2>
<p>
And here is the second test. At least one inscription is true and at least one is false. Which means the ring is in the...
</p>

<div class="box">
<div>Golden box</div>
<div class="bonmot">The ring is not in the silver box.</div>
</div>
<div class="box">
<div>Silver box</div>
<div class="bonmot">The ring is not in this box.</div>
</div>
<div class="box">
<div>Lead box</div>
<div class="bonmot">The ring is in this box.</div>
</div>
<br class="clear-both" />
<br />

<h2>Lion and Unicorn I.</h2>
<p>
Alice came across a lion and a unicorn in a forest of forgetfulness. Those two are strange beings. Lion lies every Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday and the other days in week he speaks the truth. Unicorn lies on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays, however the other days in week he speaks the truth.<br />
Lion: Yesterday I was lying.<br />
Unicorn: So was I.<br />
Which day did they say that?
</p>

<h2>Lion and Unicorn II.</h2>
<p>
Lion said: Yesterday I was lying and two days after tomorrow I will be lying again.<br />
Which day did he say that?
</p>

<br />

<h2>Island Baal</h2>
<p>
There live people and strange monkeys on this island, and you can not tell who is who. They speak either only the truth or only the lie.<br />
Who are the following two guys?<br />
A: B is a lying monkey. I am human.<br />
B: A is telling the truth.
</p>

<br />

<h2>Truth, Lie and Wisdom</h2>
<p>
Three goddesses were sitting in an old Indian temple. Their names were Truth (always true), Lie (always lying) and Wisdom (sometimes lying). There was a following conversation:<br />
Asking the left one: "Who is sitting next to you?"<br />
"Truth," she answered.<br />
Asking the middle one: &quot;Who are you?"<br />
&quot;Wisdom."<br />
And at last question for the right one: &quot;Who is your neighbor?"<br />
"Lie," she replied.<br />
Now it is clear who is who.
</p>

<br />

<h2>In the Alps</h2>
<p>
Three tourists have an argument regarding the way they should go. Hans says that Emanuel lies. Emanuel claims that Hans and Philip speak the same, only doesn't know what, whether truth or lie. So who is lying for sure?
</p>

<br />

<h2>Coins</h2>
<p>
Imagine there are 3 coins on the table. Gold, silver and copper. If you say a truthful sentence, you will get one coin. If you say a false sentence, you get nothing. Which sentence can guarantee gaining the gold coin?
</p>

<br />

<h2>Slim Lover</h2>
<p>
Something to relax. A slim young man asked a girl on a date:<br />
"I say something. If it is truthful, will you give me your photo?"<br />
"Yes," replied miss.<br />
"And if it is a lie, do not give me your photograph. Would you promise that?" <br />
The girl agreed. Then the chap said such a sentence, that after a little while of thinking she realised, that if she wanted to honor her promise, she wouldn't have to give him a photo but a <em>kiss</em>.<br />
What would you say (if you were him) to be kissed and so on?
</p>
