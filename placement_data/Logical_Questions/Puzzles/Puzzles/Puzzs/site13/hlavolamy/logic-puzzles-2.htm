<h1>Logic Puzzles II.</h1>

<div class="clear-both"></div>

<h2>Brick</h2>
<p>
An old riddle is as follows: One brick is one kilogram and half a brick heavy. How heavy is one brick?<br />
(This is a typical elementary math brain teaser.)
</p>

<h2>Strange Coins</h2>
<p>
I have two US coins totaling 55 cents. One is not a nickel. What are the coins?
</p>

<h2>What is Correct</h2>
<p>
Is it correct seven and five <em>is</em> thirteen or seven and five <em>are</em> thirteen?
</p>

<h2>Trains</h2>
<p>
A train leaves New York for Boston. Five minutes later another train leaves Boston for New York, having a double speed. Which train will be closer to New York, when they encounter?
</p>

<h2>Fly</h2>
<p>
Two trains 200 km from each other are moving at the speed of 50 km/hour to encounter. From one train a fly takes off, flying straight (upon the rails) to the other train at the speed of 75 km/hour, bounces away from it and flies back to the first train. This is repeated till the trains crash to each other and the fly is smashed.<br />
What distance is the fly able to fly until its judgement moment?<br />
(There is a complicated and an easy way to solve this math brain teaser.)
</p>

<h2>Speeding up</h2>
<p>
If I go half a way to the town at the speed of 30 km/hour, how fast do I have to go for the rest of the way to have the average speed of the entire way 60 km/hour?
</p>

<h2>Wired Equator</h2>
<p>
Perimeter of the globe is approximately 40 000 km. If we made a circle of wire around the globe, that is only 10 metres (so 0,01 km) longer than the perimeter of earth, could a flea, a rabbit or even a man creep under it?
</p>

<h2>Diophantus</h2>
<p>
We know a little about this Helen mathematician from Alexandria (called father of algebra) except that he lived about year 250 B. C. Due to one admirer of him, who described his life by the means of an algebraic riddle (math problem), we know at least something about his life.<br />
Diophantus's youth lasted 1/6 of his life. He had the first beard in the next 1/12 of his life. At the end of the following 1/7 of his life Diophantus got married. Five years from then his son was born. His son lived exactly 1/2 of Diophantus's
life. Diophantus died 4 years after the death of his son.<br />
How long did Diophantus live?
</p>

<h2>Ahmes's Papyrus</h2>
<p>
About 2000 years B. C. there lived Ahmes, a royal secretary and mathematician of the Pharaoh Amenemhat III. In year 1853 an Englishman Rhind found near the temple of Ramses II. in Thebes one of Ahmes's papyruses. The papyrus is a rectangle 33 cm wide and about 5 m long. There is this math problem on it (besides others).<br />
100 measures of corn must be divided among 5 workers, so that the second worker gets as many measures more than the first worker, as the third gets more than the second, the fourth more than the third and the fifth more than the fourth. The first two workers shall get seven times less measures of corn than the three others.<br />
How many measures of corn shall each worker get?
</p>

<h2>Midnight</h2>
<p>
If it were two hours later, it would be half as long until midnight as it would be if it were an hour later. What time is it now?
</p>

<h2>Clock</h2>
<p>
On every clock we can see that at noon the hour, minute and second hand correctly overlay. In about one hour and five minutes the minute and hour hand will overlay again. Can you calculate the exact time (to a millisecond), when it will occur and what angle they will contain with second hand?
</p>

<h2>Reservoir</h2>
<p>
One reservoir has four taps. Using the first takes two days to saturate the reservoir, the second tap three days, the third four days and the last one 6 hours. What time will it last to fill the reservoir using all 4 taps at once?
</p>

<h2>Car</h2>
<p>
A military car carrying an important letter must cross a desert. There is no petrol station on the desert and the car has space only for petrol that lasts to the middle of the desert. There are also other cars that can transfer their petrol into one another.<br />
How can the letter be delivered?
</p>

<h2>Aeroplane</h2>
<p>
There is only one airport on a fictional planet, and that is on the north pole. There are only 3 aeroplanes and lots of fuel at the airport. Full tank of an aeroplane lasts exactly to fly to the south pole, however the aeroplanes can transfer their fuel among one another.<br />
Your mission is to fly round the globe with at least one aeroplane (above the south pole) and in the end all aeroplanes must be OK back at the airport.
</p>

<h2>Belt</h2>
<p>
A magic rectangular belt always shrinks its length to 1/2 and width to 1/3 whenever its owner wishes something. After three such wishes, its surface was 4 cm<sup>2</sup>. What was the original length, if the original width was 9 cm?
</p>

<h2>Baldyville</h2>
<p>
There are following conditions in Baldyville:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>No two inhabitants have the same number of hair on their head.</li>
  <li>No inhabitant has exactly 518 hairs.</li>
  <li>There live more inhabitants than any inhabitant's hair in the town .</li>
</ol>
<p>
What is the highest possible number of inhabitants?
</p>

<h2>Josephine</h2>
<p>
The recent expedition to the lost city of Atlantis discovered scrolls attributed to the great poet, scholar, philosopher Josephine. They number eight in all, and here is the first.<br />
The kingdom of Mamajorca, was ruled by queen Henrietta I. In Mamajorca women have to pass an extensive logic exam before they are allowed to get married. Queens do not have to take this exam. All the women in Mamajorca are loyal to their queen and do whatever she tells them to. The queens of Mamajorca are truthful. All shots fired in Mamajorca can be heard in every house. All above facts are known to be common knowledge.<br />
Henrietta was worried about the infidelity of the married men in Mamajorca. She summoned all the wives to the town square, and made the following announcement. "There is at least one unfaithful husband in Mamajorca. All wives know which husbands
are unfaithful, but have no knowledge about the fidelity of their own husband. You are forbidden to discuss your husband's faithfulness with any other woman. If you discover that your husband is unfaithful, you must shoot him at precisely midnight of the day you find that out."<br />
Thirty-nine silent nights followed the queen's announcement. On the fortieth night, shots were heard. Queen Henrietta I is revered in Mamajorcan history.
</p>

<h2>Why 1 = 2</h2>
<p>
Where is the mistake in these mathematical equations?
</p>
<pre class="poem">
x = 2
x(x-1) = 2(x-1)
x<span class="sup">2</span>-x = 2x-2
x<span class="sup">2</span>-2x = x-2    
x(x-2) = x-2    
x = 1
</pre>

<h2>Open polygon</h2>
<p>
Join all 9 dots creating an open polygon with four lines.
