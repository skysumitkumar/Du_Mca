These  puzzles do not require any mathematical knowledge, just logical reasoning.  Check, how smart you are. If you cannot solve them, take it easy. 
Almost all puzzles were told to us by
a computer/math genius <A HREF="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.angelfire.com/ut/vovami/%22  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.angelfire.com/ut/vovami/"'" tppabs="http://www.angelfire.com/ut/vovami/"" target="page 3">  Vlad Mitlin </A>.

<FONT SIZE=+1><B> 3. Apples delivery</B> </A></FONT>
<UL>


The distance between the towns A and B is 1000 miles.  There is 3000 apples
in A, and the apples have to be delivered to B.  The available car 
can take 1000 apples at most.  The car driver  has
developed an addiction to apples: when he has apples aboard he eats 1
apple with each mile made.  Figure out the strategy that
yields the largest amount of apples to be delivered to B. <P>
Generalize the strategy for an arbitrary amount of apples.

Party!
<P> 
There is a group of people at a party.  Show that you can introduce some of
them to each other so that after the introduction, no more than two people
in the group would have the same number of friends (initial configuration
doesn't work because they all initially have 0 friends).

<P><HR>
Digits
<P>
Show that for any natural n, at least one of two numbers, n or n+1, can be
represented in the following form:

     k + S(k)

for a certain k, where S(k) is the sum of all digits in k.  For instance,

      21 = 15 + (5+1)

<P><HR>
Zen problem
<P>
A Buddhist monk got an errand from his teacher: to meditate for exactly 45
minutes.  He has no watch; instead he is given two inscent sticks, and he
is told that each of those sticks would completely burn in 1 hour.  The
sticks are not identical, and they burn with variant yet unknown rates
(they are hand-made).  So he has these two inscent and some matches: can
he arrange for exactly 45 minutes of meditation?

<P><HR>
Lucky tickets
<P>
In Russia you get into a bus, take a ticket, and sometimes say : Wow, a
lucky number!  Bus tickets are numbered by 6-digit numbers, and a lucky
ticket has the sum of 3 first digits being equal to the sum of 3 last
digits.  When we were in high school (guys from math school No. 7 might
remember that ) we had to write a code that prints out all the lucky
tickets' numbers; at least I did, to show my loyalty to the progammers'
clan.  Now, if you add up all the lucky tickets' numbers you will find out
that 13 (the most unlucky number) is a divisor of the result.  Can you
prove it (without writing a code)?

<P><HR>
Divisor
<P>

Prove that for any natural N,

     1000^N - 1

cannot be a divisor of

     1978^N - 1




<P><HR>
Distances 
<P>

There are 6 points in a rectangle with the sides, 3 and 4.  Prove that the
distance between at least two of these points is smaller than the square
root of 5.

<P><HR>
King
<P>

A chess king is placed on a 8x8 chessboard.  It has to make 64 moves,
visiting each (of 64) squares only once, and to return there where it
started.  The path has to be with no intersections (a path looking like '8'
is no good).
For a loop, one can count the total number of horizontal + vertical (i.e.
excluding diagonal) moves; let's call this number M.

1.   Give an example of at least one such loop.
2.   Give an example of a loop with the largest possible M.
3.   Give an example of a loop with M=28.
4.   Prove that 28 is the smallest possible M.



<P><HR>
Checkers
<P>

Consider a rectangular M x N checker board and some checkers on it.  What
is the minimum number of checkers you should put on the board for any
straight line parallel to any one of two sides of the board would cross
some (at least one) checker?

 


<P><HR>
Four numbers
<P>

Show that for positive a, b, c, end d, such that  abcd=1,

     a^2 +b^2+c^2+d^2 + ab+ac+ad+bc+bd+cd

is not smaller then 10.

Three planets in a galaxy and a market crash
<P>

A galaxy consists of three planets, each of them moving along a straight
line with its own constant speed.  If the centers of all three planets
happen to lie on a straight line (some kind of eclipse) the inhabitants of
each planet go nuts (they cannot see their two neighbor planets all at
once), start talking about the end of the world, and the stock market
crashes.  Show that there will be no more than two such market crashes on
each of these planets.

<P><HR>
Fermat, computers, and a smart boy
<P>
A computer
scientist claims that he proved somehow that the Fermat theorem is correct for the
following 3 numbers:

<P>

     x=2233445566,
<BR>
     y=7788990011,
<BR>
     z=9988776655

<P>

He announces these 3 numbers and calls for a press conference where he is
going to present the value of N (to show that

<P>

     x^N + y^N = z^N


<P>
and that the guy from Princeton was wrong).  As the press conference
starts, a 10-years old boy raises his hand and says that the respectable
scientist has made a mistake and the Fermat theorem cannot hold for those 3
numbers.  The scientist checks his computer calculations and finds a bug.


<P>
How did the boy figure out that the scientist was wrong?

<P><HR>

Toy Fermat
<P>
	Does the equation, 	x^2 + y^3 = z^4have solutions in prime numbers? Find at least one if yes, give a nonexistence proof otherwise.
<P><HR>


A sequence
<P>  A sequence of natural numbers is determined by the following formula,

          A[n+1] = a[n] + f(n)

          Where f(n) is the product of digits in a[n].  Is there an a[1]
          such that the above sequence is unbounded?


<P><HR>
 Intellectual power of a dragon pack <P> 
     Dragons have to meet for a brainstorm in a convention center.  The
     delegates have to be selected to provide the maximum efficiency of the
     brainstorm session.  A dragon has any amount of heads, and for any N,
     any amount of N-headed dragons is available if needed.  The problem is
     that the size of the convention center is limited so no more than 1000
     heads can fit into the assembly hall.  The intellectual power of a
     dragon pack is the product of head numbers of dragons in the pack.
     How should an optimum pack look like (the total number of dragons, the
     head number distribution)?

 The vampire slayer<P>
     On the surface of the planet lives a vampire , that can move with the
     speed not greater than u. A vampire slayer spaceship approaches to the
     planet with its speed v.  As soon as the spaceship sees the vampire it
     shots a silver bullet - the vampire is dead.
     Prove that if v/u > 10 , the vampire slayer can accomplish his
     mission, even the vampire is trying to hide.

<P><HR> 
Projectors
<P>  (2D) a projector illuminates a quadrant on a plane.  4 projectors are
set in 4 arbitrary points of the plane.  Show that they can be turned so
that the whole plane would be illuminated.(3D) Show that the whole space
can be illuminated with 8 projectors, each illuminating an octant, however
the location points are.

A vigilance campaign in Salt Lake City.
<P>
Salt Lake City looks like a rectangle crossed with <B> M</B> streets going from
North to South and with <B>N</B>  streets going from East to West. The city is frequently visited by tourists who suppose to run around in the busses. 
The Utah governor  wants to vigil  all moves of the busses.   He plans to put policemen at some intersections to watch all the busses moving on
 the streets visible from that intersections. 
What is the minimum number of policemen needed for the bus watch?

Blondes (the puzzle from Oldaque P. de Freitas)
<P>
Two blondes are sitting in a street cafe, talking about the children.
One says that she has three daughters. The product of their ages equals 36
and the sum of the ages coincides with the number of the house across the street. The second blonde replies that this information  is not enough  to 
figure out the age of each child. The first agrees and adds that the oldest daughter has the beautiful blue eyes. Then the second solves the puzzle. 
You might solve it too! 
<P><HR>
This one comes from Grzegorz Dzierzanowski
<P>

There are 12 toothpicks. Find  polygons of extremal field, using all
toothpicks. While building these polygons follow the rules :
- you cannot break the toothpicks,
- the length of each edge is 1,2,3,... toothpicks,
- the edges of the polygon cannot cross each other.
