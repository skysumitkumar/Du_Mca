The presented form of publication 
is not a joke or a charade-type game:
it imitates informal conversations between 
colleagues when a letter envelope is used to
illustrate ideas and approaches. In mathematics, this style is proved to be very efficient and it seems to be consistent with Web 
mainstream tone.

We decided to keep this informal style in 
our Web discussion of the serious problem of
detectability we formulate below. 
The standard mathematical text is placed in the Epilogue.

<h3>
Prologue</h3>
</DL><DL></DL><DL>

     Consider the problem of detection of material's damage by simple 
electrical measurements. The addressed question is whether or not a conducting body contains damaged regions inside?
Suppose that damaged material forms inclusions of a lower
conductivity, and nothing is known about inclusions location.
</DL><DL>
      A boundary current is applied to detect the presence of inclusions 
and the spent energy is measured. The sensitivity (resolution) 
of measurements is limited.  An inclusion is detected if 
the difference between the spent energies for the body with 
and without inclusions is greater then the noise level of 
measurements. We want 
</DL><DL>
- to find a current which detects 
the worst position of inclusions and </DL><DL>
- to establish bounds for detectability. </DL><DL>

     The problem of detection naturally arises in technical 
diagnostics and tomography where the presence of cracks,
 corrosion, or other defects in a sample is to be determined.

<h3>
Rules of the game: 
</h3>
<TABLE>The problem is formulated as a game between a spot of  damaged material 
 which hides and the boundary current which seeks.
<TD><IMG SRC="f1.gif" tppabs="http://www.math.utah.edu/~cherk/inverse/f1.gif"></TD><TD>


I. Red player places inclusions (damaged material) of fixed 
total volume somewhere inside the domain.
<P>

II. Green player detects them by injecting arbitrary boundary currents
 of fixed energy. 
<P>

III. The goal of Red is to minimize the energy difference 
between spot-free sample and the real one, the goal of Green 
is to maximize it. 
<P>

IV. Green has no information about the Red's strategy. </TD>
</TABLE>

The cost of the game is equal to the resolution.  The best "Green" strategy  ensures the detection of defects of given size.

<h3>
An optimal location of a small inclusion 

and an optimal field density:</DL><DL></h3>

We analyse first the optimal location of an infinitesimal inclusion. 
</DL><DL>

</DL>
<TABLE>
<TD> <IMG SRC="f4.gif" tppabs="http://www.math.utah.edu/~cherk/inverse/f4.gif"></TD>
<TD> The measured response is proportional to the field density 
in the neighborhood of the inclusion. Therefore:
<P>
I.  The `worst' inclusion hides itself 
where the field density is minimal.
<P>

II. An optimal current maximizes the minimum throughout the domain of its absolute value,
 hence the density of an optimal field is constant everywhere.</TD></TABLE>

<h3>
Green strategy</DL><DL>
</h3>

<TABLE> <TD><IMG SRC="f3.gif" tppabs="http://www.math.utah.edu/~cherk/inverse/f3.gif">
</TD>
<TD>
The best strategy for the Green is to make the field  inside the tested body uniform.
<P>

The class of Green Currents always contains Neumann data 
  which  provide a constant field inside any homogeneous domain (see the picture).
<P>

The constant fields density is independent of the direction 
of an optimal current. This direction can be arbitrary chosen.</TD> </TABLE>

<h3>
Red  strategy:</h3>

<TABLE><TD><IMG SRC="f2.gif" tppabs="http://www.math.utah.edu/~cherk/inverse/f2.gif"></TD>
<TD> A shape of the most hidden inclusions.
<P>

Hidden inclusions are elongated along the lines of the field:  additional portions of the inclusion material 
hide in the shadow of seed inclusions.
</TD> </TABLE>
<h3>
Formation of an optimal laminated composite 
from the  hidden inclusions.

<TABLE> <TD><IMG SRC="f5.gif" tppabs="http://www.math.utah.edu/~cherk/inverse/f5.gif">
</TD>
<TD>In 
order to hide itself the inclusion disperses and  forms laminates oriented along the field. 
<P>

One can check that these laminates fit the necessary conditions of optimality: the current is constant, the inclusions lead to minimal disturbance of the energy.</TD> </TABLE>
<HR>
<h3>Solution: Inclusions form a laminate composite! </h3>
</DL><DL>


<TABLE><TD><IMG SRC="f6.gif" tppabs="http://www.math.utah.edu/~cherk/inverse/f6.gif"></TD>
<TD>The most unfortunate distribution of inclusions: homogeneous 
laminates oriented along the field.
The effective properties of laminates lead to an analytical 
lower bound for detectability which is independent of the
 shape of the domain.</TD> </TABLE>
<HR>
<h3>Reformulation of the problem:</h3>
</DL><DL>
Green can do better either by applying a current in another
 direction or by applying several currents. The problem is
 reformulated as following: 

<TABLE >
<TR><TD><IMG SRC="f7.gif" tppabs="http://www.math.utah.edu/~cherk/inverse/f7.gif"></TD>
<TD><IMG SRC="f8.gif" tppabs="http://www.math.utah.edu/~cherk/inverse/f8.gif"></TD></TR>

<TR> <TD>either a constant current with random  orientation is applied
 and the mean of detectability is maximized,
</TD>
<TD>or two orthogonal constant currents are applied.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>



<h3>Strategy for the reformulated problem</h3>


<TABLE><TR><TD><IMG SRC="f9.gif" tppabs="http://www.math.utah.edu/~cherk/inverse/f9.gif"></TD><TD>
In the reformulated (relaxed) problem, Red uses Laminates of Second Rank
 which can be adjusted to minimize the sum of energies due to 
two orthogonal currents by changing the free parameter of 
inclusion density in the inner layers</TD></TR>

<h3> Saddle point </H3>
<TABLE><TR>
<TD><IMG SRC="f10.gif" tppabs="http://www.math.utah.edu/~cherk/inverse/f10.gif"></TD>
<TD>The reformulated problem possesses a saddle point solution.
<P>

Optimal solution of the game is achieved by choosing the degree of anisotropy of the composite and the  magnitude of one of the applied currents. 
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<h3> Solution of the relaxed problem </H3>

<TABLE> <TD><IMG SRC="f11.gif" tppabs="http://www.math.utah.edu/~cherk/inverse/f11.gif"></TD>
<TD>
<FONT  COLOR="GREEN"><B>Green strategy </B></FONT  COLOR>: the magnitudes of two orthogonal currents are equal
<P>
<FONT  COLOR="RED"><B>Red strategy</B></FONT  COLOR>: The worst location of inclusions is a uniform 
isotropic composite of the minimal conductivity.
<P>

This solution gives an analytical lower bound for detectability in the reformulated (relaxed) problem.</TD> </TABLE>
