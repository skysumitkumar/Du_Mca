<P>
The fields in heterogeneous materials and structures are also highly
inhomogeneous, even if the load is uniform in space. To characterize
the structures, it is used an average description, when the material's
properties are replaced by an ``effective properties tensor''
so that the fields in the equivalent material are equal to the mean
fields in the structure. Usually, the calculation of effective
properties require numerical solutions of a boundary value problem.

<P>
Here we describe a large class of structures whose effective properties
can be explicitly calculated, due to special symmetries and/or
iterative schemes.

<P>
The following review of the theory is mainly after the  
book
