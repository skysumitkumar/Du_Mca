The imaginary number is a fine and wonderful recourse of the divine spirit,  
almost an amphibian between being and not being.

<B> Policy:</B> 

<UL> 
 <I>   Exercises: </I>   Problems are typical of what you'll 
 be asked on exams. <P> 

<I> Calculator: </I>    A calculator is not required for the course, 
 although it may be
           useful for some homework problems. Calculators will be 
           forbidden in
           exams.<P> 

<I> Final exam: </I>   Half of the final will be devoted to
           material covered after the second midquarter exam. 
           The rest will be
           comprehensive. Students must take the final to pass
            the course.
<P> 

<I>  Grades:</I>    The final grade will be based on the following
 score:  Two
midquarter exams (50%) + homework(10%) + final score (40%).
<P> 

<I>  ADA:	</I>    The Americans with Disabilities Act requires 
that reasonable
           accommodations be provided for students with physical,  
           sensory, 
           cognitive,  systemic,  learning and psychiatric disabilities.
            Please
           contact me at the beginning of the quarter to discuss any such
           accommodations for the course.
