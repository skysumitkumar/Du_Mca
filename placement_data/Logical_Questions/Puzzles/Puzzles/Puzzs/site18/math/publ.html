  The waves of damage in elastic-plastic lattices with waiting
links: design and simulation
 </a> <p>
<b>Abstract</b>
<br>
We consider protective structures with elastic-plastic links of a special
morphology. The links are bistable: they are designed to arrest the
development of localized damage (a neck) in an element, initiating
the damage instead in another sequential element.  A wave of
``partial damage" propagates through the chain, as  all the links
develop necks but do not fail. When subjected to an impact, such a
structure absorbs several times more energy than a conventional
structure, which makes it more protective against collision.
A three-dimensional finite element analysis is used to compute the
force-elongation relation for a bistable element. Another numerical
procedure  analyzes the dynamics of a chain or a lattice undergoing
a collision with a heavy projectile. The procedure describes the
nonlinear waves, determines the places of failure and the critical
loading conditions. A bistable chain is compared with a chain of
conventional links, of the same length, mass, and material. The
bistable chain is capable to withstand a collision with a mass of
kinetic energy, several times greater. Even when the bistable chain
breaks it is able to more effectively reduce the speed of the
projectile.

 Transition waves in bistable structures. I. Delocalization of damage  
 </a> (JMPS. In print)


 <p>

We consider chains of dimensionless  masses connected by breakable bistable 
links. 
A non-monotonic  piecewise linear  constitutive relation for each link  
 consists of two stable branches separated by a             
gap of zero resistance. Mechanically, this model can be envisioned as a   
"twin-element"  
structure which consists of two links (rods or strands) of different lengths 
joined by                                                                     
the ends. The longer link does not resist to the loading until  the shorter   
link                                                                          
breaks. We call this construction the {\em waiting link  structure}. We show  
that the 
chain of such strongly nonlinear elements  has an increased in-the-large      
stability       
under extension  in comparison with a conventional chain, and can absorb a     large                                                                        
 amount                                                                       
of energy. This is achieved by two reasons. One is an increase of dissipation 
in the form of high-frequency waves transferring the mechanical energy to heat; this 
is 
manifestation of the inner instabilities of the bonds. The other is  
delocalization of 
the damage of the chain. The increased stability  is a consequence of  the 
distribution   
of a partial damage over a large volume of the body instead of its                 localization,  as 
in the case of a single neck formation in a conventional chain. We optimize   
parameters    
of the structure in order to improve its resistance to a slow loading    and 
show that               
it can be increased significantly by delocalizing a damage process. In 
particular,  we		            
show that the dissipation is a function of the gap between the stable branches
and find                                                                      
an optimal gap corresponding to maximum energy consumption under quasi-static 
extension. The  results of numerical simulations of the dynamic behavior of   
bistable                                                                      
chains show  that  these chains can withstand                                 
 without breaking the force which is several times larger than the force      
sustained by a conventional chain.                                            
The formulation and results are also related to the modelling                 
of compressive destruction of a porous material or a frame construction which 
can be described by a two-branched diagram with a 
large gap between the branches.    
We also consider an extension of the model to multi-link chain that could     
imitate               
plastic behavior of material.

 II. Analytical solution: Wave speed and energy dissipation.
 </a> (JMPS. In print)


<p>

We consider dynamics of chains of rigid masses connected by links described
 by
irreversible, piecewise linear constitutive relation: the force--elongation
 diagram                                         
consists of two stable branches with a jump discontinuity at the transition
 point. The 
transition from one stable state to the other propagates along the chain 
and excites a                                     
complex system of waves. In the first part of the paper
<a href="chain1.pdf" tppabs="http://www.math.utah.edu/~cherk/publ/chain1.pdf">  Transition waves in bistable structures. I. Delocalization of damage</a>, the branches  
could be separated by a gap where the tensile force is zero, 
the transition wave  was treated as a wave of partial damage. 
Here we assume that there is no zero-force    
gap between the branches. This allows us to obtain steady-state 
analytical solutions   for a general piecewise linear trimeric diagram
 with parallel and nonparallel branches   
and an arbitrary jump at the transition. We derive necessary 
conditions for the existence of the transition waves and compute
 the speed of the wave. We also determine the energy of dissipation
 which can be  significantly increased in a structure characterized 
by a nonlinear discontinuous         
constitutive relation. The considered chain model reveals 
some phenomena typical for waves of failure or crushing in 
constructions and materials under collision, waves in a 
structure specially designed as a dynamic energy absorber 
and waves of phase transitions in artificial and natural
 passive and active systems.

<b>Abstract</b>:
The paper reviews recent development of mathematical methods for
nonconvex variational problems of mechanics, particularly,
problems of optimal layouts of material in a heterogeneous medium.
 We discuss variational formulations of these problems, properties of
their solutions and several approaches  to address them:
minimizing sequences and technique of laminates, laminate closure,
and differential scheme; necessary conditions by structural
variations and  minimal extension technique; the lower bounds and
bounds for the variety of effective tensors of properties.
 Particularly, the bound for the tensor of
thermal expansion coefficients is found. Special attention is paid
to the use of duality for reformulation of minimax problems as
minimal ones.

<br><b>Abstract</b>:
The paper addresses a problem of robust optimal
design of elastic structures
when the loading is unknown, and only an integral constraint for
the loading is given. We suggest to minimize the principal
compliance of the domain equal to the maximum of the stored
energy over all admissible loadings.
The principal compliance is the maximal compliance under
the extreme, worst possible loading. The robust optimal
design is formulated as a min-max problem for the energy stored
in the structure. The maximum of the energy is chosen over
the constrained class of loadings, while the
minimum is taken over the design parameters.
It is shown that the problem for
the extreme loading can be reduced to an elasticity problem
with mixed nonlinear boundary condition; the last problem
may have multiple  solutions. The optimization with respect to
the designed structure
takes into account the possible multiplicity of extreme
loadings and divides resources (reinforced material) to
equally resist all of them. Continuous change of the loading
constraint causes bifurcation of the solution of the optimization
problem. It is shown that an invariance of the constraints under
a symmetry transformation leads to a symmetry of the optimal
design. Examples of optimal design are investigated; symmetries
and bifurcations of the solutions are revealed.

<br><b>Abstract</b>:
The paper suggests an approach for optimization of morphology of 
mechanical structures subjected to an
impact. 
We consider  chains or lattices with breakable bistable   
links. A nonmonotonic  constitutive relation for
each link  consists of two stable branches separated by an unstable branch.    M
echanically, this model can be envisioned as a       
"twin-element" 
structure which consists of two elastic-brittle or elastic-plastic 
links (rods or strands) of different lengths  
joined by the ends. The longer link                                           
does not resist to the loading until the shorter rod breaks or
develops a neck. When a chain or lattice of these elements is elongated
they excite waves of damage that carry the energy away. 
We analytically describe and simulate transition waves
of damage in bistable
structures.  We show that strength  against an impact 
of the chain or lattice with nonmonotonic links increases several
times; such structure can absorb much more energy before breakage
than a conventional structure.

<h4>
Abstract</h4>
The amazing rationality of biological "constructions" excites the interest
to modelling them by using the mathematical tools developed in the theory
of structural optimization. The structural optimization solves a geometrical
problem of the ``best" displacements of different materials in a given
domain, under certain loadings. Of course, this approach simplifies the
real biological problem, because the questions of the mechanism of the
building and maintaining of structures are not addressed. The main problem
is to guess a functional for the optimization of a living organism. The
optimal designs are highly inhomogeneous; their microstructures may be
geometrically different, but possess the same effective properties. Therefore
the comparing of the various optimal geometries is not trivial. We show,
that the variety of optimal geometries shares the same characteristics
of the stress tensor in any optimal structure. Namely, special norm of
this tensor stay constant within each phase of the optimal mixture.
<p>The paper also adresses the uncertainty of the ultimate load in biological
``structures". We discuss the corresponding min-max formulation of the
optimal design problem. The design problem is formulated as minimization
of the stored energy of the project under the most unfavorable loading.
The problem is reduced to minimization of Steklov eigenvalues.

<h4>
Abstract</h4>
We study optimal layout of piece-wise periodic structures of linearly elastic
materials. The effective tensors of these structures are constant within
pre-specified regions, the optimality is understood as the minimum of complementary
energy. The suggested formulation leads to a construction that is stable
under variation of the loading and which does not degenerates into checker-board
type structures. We derive necessary conditions of optimality of such layouts
and analyze them. Numerically, we find optimal structures for a number
of examples, which are analyzed.

<h4>
Abstract</h4>
Optimal design problems are usually formulated as problems of minimization
of the energy, stored in the design under a prescribed loading. Solutions
of these problems are unstable to perturbations of the loading. We suggest
a new min-max formulation of the optimal design problem which has a stable
solution. The loading is not prescribed, but only a set of admissible loadings
is given. The stable optimal design problem is formulated as minimization
of the stored energy of the project under the most unfavorable loading.
This most dangerous loading is one that maximizes the stored energy over
the class of admissible functions. The problem is reduced to minimization
of Steklov eigenvalues. Several stable solutions of various optimal design
problems are demonstrated; among them are the optimal structure of a material
stable to variations in uniaxial loading, the optimal specific stiffness
of an uncertainly loaded beam, and the stable design of an optimal wheel.

<h4>
Abstract</h4>
The variational approach to structural optimization is considered. The
problem asks for the optimal layout of several conducting and elastic materials
throughout an inhomogeneous body. The simplest problem of the minimization
of the total energy is reviewed. A problem of minimization of a more general
functional is considered and a method is suggested to reduce it to the
simplest variational problem of the minimization of the sum of the energy
and the complimentary energy corresponding to two orthogonal external fields.
The characteristic properties of optimally designed media are discussed.
Particularly, it is shown that optimal microstructures possess the maximal
anisotropy. Examples of optimal structures and of optimal designs are discussed.

<h4>
Abstract</h4>
The problem of optimal shape of a single cavity in an infinite 2D elastic
domain is analyzed. An elastic plane is subjected to a uniform load at
infinity. The cavity of fixed area is said to be optimal if it provides
the minimal energy change between the homogeneous plane and the plane with
the cavity. We show that for the case of shear loading the contour of the
optimal cavity is not smooth but is shaped as a curved quadrilateral. The
shape is specified in terms of conformal mapping coefficients, and explicit
analytical representations for components of the dipole tensor associated
with the cavity are employed. We also find the exact values of angles at
the corners of the optimal contour. The applications include the problems
of optimal design for dilute composites.

<h4>
Abstract</h4>
It is shown that any given positive definite fourth order tensor satisfying
the usual symmetries of elasticity tensors can be realized as the effective
elasticity tensor of a two-phase composite comprised of a sufficiently
compliant isotropic phase and a sufficiently rigid isotropic phase configured
in an suitable microstructure. The building blocks for constructing this
composite are what we call extremal materials. These are composites of
the two phases which are extremely stiff to a set of arbitrary given stresses
and, at the same time, are extremely compliant to any orthogonal stress.
An appropriately chosen subset of the extremal materials are layered together
to form the composite with elasticity tensor matching the given tensor.

<h4>
Abstract</h4>
This paper investigates the range of possible elastic moduli of two-dimensional
isotropic polycrystals. The polycrystals are comprised of grains obtained
from a single orthotropic material. The overall elastic properties are
described by an effective bulk modulus $K_0$ and an effective shear modulus
$\Gm_0$. The pair $(K_0,\Gm_0)$ is shown to be confined to a rectangle
in the $(K,\Gm)$ plane. Microstructures are identified which correspond
to every point within the rectangle, and in particular to the corner points.
Optimal bounds on the effective Poisson's ratio and Young's modulus follow
immediately. Under a certain constraint on the crystal moduli, the rectangle
degenerates to a line segment: the effective shear modulus of such a polycrystal
is microstructure independent. This extends earlier work of Hill and Lurie
and Cherkaev who established microstructure independence for polycrystals
constructed from square symmetric crystals.

<h4>
Abstract</h4>
In this paper we construct microstructures of multiphase composites with
unusual properties: their heat conductivity in one direction is equal to
the harmonic or arithmetic mean of the phases' heat conductivities and
the conductivity in an orthogonal direction does not equal either arithmetic
or harmonic mean. Two dimensional three-phase structures are studied, but
the results can be easily generalized for the three-dimensional composites
with arbitrary number of phases.

<h4>
Abstract</h4>
The problems of optimal design of conducting and elastic inhomogeneous
bodies is considered; these problems are described as variational problem
with differential restrictions which are the equations of the state of
the body. A method is suggested for reducing the problem of restricted
minimum to the simplest variational problem of the minimization of the
sum of the energy and the complimentary energy correspondent to two orthogonal
external fields; it is based on the Legandre transformation of slightly
reformulated initial problem. The characteristic properties of optimally
designed bodies are discussed. It is shown, in particular, that the optimal
microstructures possess the maximal anisotropy in the sense that they minimize
the difference between the energy densities caused by two orthogonal loadings.

<h4>
Abstract</h4>
We consider linear processes in media with dissipation arising in conductivity,
optics, viscoelasticity, etc. Time-periodic fields in such media are described
by linear differential equations for complex-valued potentials. The properties
of the media are characterized by complex valued tensors, for example,
by complex conductivity or complex elasticity tensors. We suggest variational
formulations for such problems: we construct the functionals whose Euler
equations coincide with the original ones. We get four equivalent variational
principles: two minimax and two minimal ones. The functionals of the obtained
minimal variational principles are proportional to the energy dissipation
averaged over the period of oscillation. The last principles can be used
in the homogenization theory to obtain the bounds on the effective properties
of composite materials with complex valued properties tensors.

<h4>
Abstract</h4>
In this paper the following questions are considered: What are the phenomena
which limit the total fracture energy of a structure under the extension
before is breaks? When is the limiting energy level more important than
the stress limit? What are possible ways to increase the required fracture
energy of a sample before it breaks? It is shown that the required features
of a material or of a construction can be achieved by using special structures
of ordinary elements. The possibilities are discussed for increasing the
fracture energy density in a sample, and increasing the total fracture
energy in a construction. The dynamic process of damaging discussed as
well.
