Optimality of bio-materials&nbsp;<br>
and "inverse optimization"</h1></center>

<ul>&nbsp;
<br>The amazing rationality of biological ``constructions" calls for the
use of&nbsp; mathematical methods of structural optimization&nbsp; to model
them. For example,&nbsp; trunks of trees, feathers, leafs, muscle system,
or bones are mechanical structures made of composites with variable parameters
that adapts itself to the environment. Similarly to an engineering construction,
they&nbsp; support&nbsp; weight,&nbsp; must sustain certain external loadings,&nbsp;&nbsp;
and they have been perfected by the Evolution.
<p>Studying bio-structures,&nbsp; it may be postulated&nbsp; that they
are optimal with respect to some goal, which means that they are best adapted
to the environment. The question is:&nbsp; <b>In what sense is the structure
optimal?</b>
<p>&nbsp;It would be natural to apply optimization methods developed for
engineering constructions to biological structures. However, the two problems
are mutually inverse.&nbsp; The biological structure is known, but it is
not clear in what sense (if&nbsp; any) the structure is optimal. In contrast,
in engineering problems, the goal is the minimization of a given functional
that is not the subject of a search or even a discussion; the problem is
to find the optimal structure.
<p>The problem&nbsp; is formulated as an "i<b>nverse optimization problem</b>":</ul>

<ul>
<ul><i><font size=+1>Find a goal functional of an optimization problem,</font></i>
<br><i><font size=+1>if the solution to that problem is known.</font></i></ul>
