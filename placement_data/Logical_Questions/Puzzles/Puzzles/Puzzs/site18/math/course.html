<p>The desire for <b>optimality</b> (perfection) is inherent for humans.
The search for extremes inspires mountaineers, scientists, mathematicians,
and the rest of the human race. A beautiful and practical mathematical
theory of optimization (i.e. search-for-optimum strategies) is developed
since the sixties when computers become available. Every new generation
of computers allows for attacking new types of problems and calls for new
methods. The goal of the theory is the creation of reliable methods to
catch the extremum of a function by an intelligent arrangement of its evaluations
(measurements). This theory is vitally important for modern engineering
and planning that incorporate optimization at every step of the complicated
decision making process.
<p>This <b>course </b>discusses classical direct search-for-optimum methods,
such as <i>Golden Mean, Conjugate Gradients, Modified Newton Method, </i>methods
for constrained optimization, including<i> Linear and Quadratic Programming,</i>
and others. We will also briefly review
<i>genetic algorithms</i> that
mimic evolution and <i>stochastic algorithms</i> that account for uncertainties
of mathematical models. The course work includes several homework assignments
that ask to implement the studied methods and a final project, that will
also be orally presented in the class.

Introduction to Optimization</h3></center>
Everyone who studied calculus knows that an extremum of a smooth function
is reached at a stationary point where its gradient vanishes. Some may
also remember the Weierstrass theorem which proclaims that the minimum
and the maximum of a function in a closed finite domain do exist. Does
this mean that the problem is solved?
<p>A small thing remains: To actually find that maximum. This problem is
the subject of the <i>optimization theory </i>that deals with algorithms
for search of the extremum. More precisely, we are looking for an algorithm
to approach a proximity of this maximum and we are allowed to evaluate
the function (to measure it) in a finite number of points. Below, some
links to mathematical societies and group in optimization are placed that
testify how popular the optimization theory is today: Many hundreds of
groups are intensively working on it.

<h4>
Optimization and Modeling</h4>

<li>
The modeling<font color="#993399"> </font>of the optimizing process is
conducted along with the optimization. Inaccuracy of the model is emphasized
in optimization problem, since optimization usually brings the control
parameters to the edge, where a model may fail to accurately describe the
prototype. For example, when a linearized model is optimized, the optimum
often corresponds to infinite value of the linearized control. <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.math.utah.edu/~cherk/teach/opt/opt2.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is linked too far away from its Starting Address. If you increase the in-domain depth setting for the Starting Address, this file will be queued for retrieval.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.math.utah.edu/~cherk/teach/opt/opt2.html'" tppabs="http://www.math.utah.edu/~cherk/teach/opt/opt2.html" TARGET="page 3">(Click
here to see an example)</a> On the other hand, the roughness of the model
should not be viewed as a negative factor, since the simplicity of a model
is as important as the accuracy. Recall the joke about the most accurate
geographical map: It is done in the 1:1 scale.</li>

<li>
Unlike the models of a physical phenomena, an optimization models critically
depend on designer's will.&nbsp; Firstly, different aspects of the process
are emphasized or neglected depending on the optimization goal. Secondly,
it is not easy to set the goal and the specific constrains for optimization.</li>

<blockquote>Naturally, one wants to produce more goods, with lowest cost
and highest quality. To optimize the production, one either may constrain
by some level the cost and the quality and maximize the quantity, or constrain
the quantity and quality and minimize the cost, or constrain the quantity
and the cost and maximize the quality. There is no way to avoid the difficult
choice of the values of constraints.&nbsp; The mathematical tricks go not
farther than: "Better be healthy and wealthy than poor and ill". True,
still not too exciting.</blockquote>

<li>
The maximization of the monetary profit solves the problem to some extent
by applying an universal criterion. Still, the short-term and long-term
profits require very different strategies; and it is necessary to assign
the level of insurance, to account for possible market variations, etc.
These variables must be a priori assigned by the researcher.</li>

<li>
Sometimes, a solution of an optimization problem shows unexpected features:
for example, an optimal trajectory zigzags infinitely often. Such behavior
points to an unexpected, but optimal behavior of the solution. It should
not be rejected as a mathematical extravaganza, but thought through! (<a href="struct_opt.html" tppabs="http://www.math.utah.edu/~cherk/opt/struct_opt.html" TARGET="page 3">Click

<h4>
Assumptions</h4>

<dir>
<dir>
<li>
<font color="#993399">There is no smart algorithm for choosing the oldest
person from an alphabetical telephone directory.</font></li>
</dir>
This says that some properties of the maximized function be a priori assumed.
Without assumptions, no rational algorithms can be suggested. The search
methods approximate -- directly or indirectly -- the behavior of the function
in the neighborhood of measurements. The approximation is based on the
assumed <font color="#993399"><i>smoothness</i> </font>or sometimes the
<i><font color="#993399">convexity</font></i>
Various methods assume different types of the approximation.
<br>&nbsp;
<dir>
<li>
<font color="#993399">My maximum is higher than your maximum!</font></li>
</dir>
Generally, there are no ways to predict the behavior of the function everywhere
in the permitted domain. An optimized function may have more than one local
maximum. Most of the methods pilot the search to a local maximum without
a guarantee that this maximum is also a global one. Those methods that
guarantee the global character of the maximum, require additional assumptions
as the convexity.
<br>&nbsp;

Several classical optimization problems serve as testing grounds for optimization
algorithms. Those are: <font color="#993399"><i>maximum of an one-dimensional

<h4>
Classification</h4>
To explain how knotty the optimization problems are, one may try to classify
them. I recommend to look at the <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www-fp.mcs.anl.gov/otc/Guide/OptWeb/index.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www-fp.mcs.anl.gov/otc/Guide/OptWeb/index.html'" tppabs="http://www-fp.mcs.anl.gov/otc/Guide/OptWeb/index.html" TARGET="page 3">optimization

<ul>
<li>
Numerous optimization methods are designed for various number<font color="#993399"><i>
of independent controls</i> </font>(dimensionality). These ranges corresponds
to one variable, several (two to ten), dozens, hundreds, or tens of thousands.</li>

<ul>
<li>
An important special class -- <font color="#993399">discrete optimization</font>
-- corresponds to a large number of controls that take only integer or
Boolean values. It requires combinatorial methods.</li>

<li>
Another special case --
<a href="calc-var2.html" tppabs="http://www.math.utah.edu/~cherk/teach/calc-var2.html" TARGET="page 3">calculus
of variations </a>-- corresponds to infinitely many controls.</li>
</ul>

<li>
A significant parameter is the <i><font color="#993399">cost of evaluation</font></i>
of the function: It ranges from milliseconds of the computer time to lengthy
and costly measurements in natural experiments. Accordingly, the realistic
goals and the methods are different.</li>

<td>The <font color="#993399"><i>sharpness of the maximum</i> </font>is
of a special interest. It is very difficult to find a maximum of a flat

a point of the maximum elevation in a flat&nbsp; region is much harder
to determine than to locate a peak in the mountains. A sharp maximum&nbsp;
(left figure)&nbsp; also requires some special methods since the gradient
is discontinuous; it does not exist in the optimal point.&nbsp;</td>

choice of the strategy. Th<font color="#993399">e <i>constrained problem</i></font>

In any practical problem, the researcher meets a unique combination of
mentioned factors and has to decide what numerical tools to use or modify
to reach the goal. Therefore, the optimization always includes creativity
and intuition. It is said that optimization belongs to both science and
