Many  applications, like  <A HREF="struct_opt.html" tppabs="http://www.math.utah.edu/~cherk/opt/struct_opt.html">optimal design,</A>  theory of <A HREF="composites.html" tppabs="http://www.math.utah.edu/~cherk/composites.html">composites</A>, phase transitions in solids, etc. 
requires the soliution of  variational problems with non-convex (non-quasiconvex) integrands. 
These problems usually do not possess a classical (smooth) solution, 
but weird minimizing sequences which are characterized 
by infinitely often oscillation (or by fine scale alternation) 
of solutions. 
<P>
To deal with those problems, one needs to find their relaxed reformulation.
The relaxed problem  has
 the same cost as the original one. It also possess a smooth solution which is an average upon a small volume of the highly oscillated solution  of the original problem. 
 <P>
It is known several techniques to handle these problems. They include
<LI> 
 lower bounds for the solutions (Translation method.) 
</LI> 

<LI> 
 a detailed structure of minimizing sequences,
</LI> 

<LI> 
 special necessary conditions technique.
</LI> 
<P>
For multidimensional variational problems, these areas are mainly open.
