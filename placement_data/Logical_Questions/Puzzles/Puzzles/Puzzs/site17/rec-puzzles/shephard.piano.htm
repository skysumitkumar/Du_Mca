<h1>Solution to the /geometry/shephard.piano problem</h1>
<hr>
This problem is unsolved.  A simple solution called the "Shephard
piano" (or Hammersley sofa) has area pi/2 + 2/pi = 2.2074.., but this can 
be improved upon with local modifications. It is known
that a maximum area exists, but not whether the shape achieving it is
symmetric, smooth, or even unique. For some interesting pictures and 
calculations see:
