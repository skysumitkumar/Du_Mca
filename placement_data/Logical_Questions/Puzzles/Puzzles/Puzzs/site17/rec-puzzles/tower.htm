Answer: e^(1/e)

<p>
Let N be the number in question and R the result of the process. Then
R can be defined recursively by the equation:
<pre>
   (1) R = N^R
</pre>
Taking the logarithm of both sides of (1):
<pre>
   (2) ln(R) = R * ln(N)
</pre>
Dividing (2) by R and rearranging:
<pre>
   (3) ln(N) = ln(R) / R
</pre>
Exponentiating (3):
<pre>
   (4) N = R^(1/R)
</pre>
We wish to find the maximum value of N with respect to R. Find the
derivative of N with respect to R and set it equal to zero:
<pre>
   (5) d(N)/d(R) = (1 - ln(R)) / R^2 = 0
</pre>
For finite values of R, (5) is satisfied by R = e. This is a maximum of
N if the second derivative of N at R = e is less than zero.
<pre>
   (6) d2(N)/d2(R) | R=e = (2 * ln(R) - 3) / R^3 | R=e = -1 / e^3 &lt; 0
</pre>
The solution therefore is (4) at R = e:
<pre>
   (7) Nmax = e^(1/e)
</pre>
