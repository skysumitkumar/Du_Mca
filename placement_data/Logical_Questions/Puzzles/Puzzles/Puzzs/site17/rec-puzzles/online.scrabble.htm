<h1>Solution to the /competition/games/online/online.scrabble problem</h1>
<hr>
Announcing ScrabbleMOO, a server running at 134.53.14.110, port 7777
(nextsrv.cas.muohio.edu 7777).  The server software is version 1.7.0
of the LambdaMOO server code.

<p>
To reach it, you can use <a href="telnet://134.53.14.110:7777">
"telnet 134.53.14.110 7777"</a>, and sign on.  You
will have a unique name and password on the server, and directions are
provided in the opening screen on how to accomplish signing on.  The
first time, you will need to type "create YourName YourPassword", and
each time thereafter, "connect YourName YourPassword".

<p>
There are currently 5 Scrabble boards set up, with global individual
high score and game-cumulative high score lists.  Games can be saved,
and restored at a later time.  There are complete command instructions
at each board (via the command "instructions"); usage is simple and
intuitive.  There are commands to undo turns, exchange tiles, and pass,
and there are a variety of options available to change the way the
board and rack are displayed.

<p>
We do not yet have a dictionary for challenges installed on-line, and
that is coming very soon.  I am seriously contemplating using the
OSPD.shar wordlist that Ross Beresford listed in a recent Usenet
article.  It seems to have the full wordlist from the 1st edition
of the OSPD, plus longer words from some other source.  I have
personal wordlists updating the OSPD to the 2nd edition, for words
up to 4 letters long, and will have the longer words in the near
future.

<p>
Usage of a certain dictionary for challenges is not enforced, and
really can't be.  Many of the regular players there have their
personal copy of the OSPD.  It's all informal, and for fun.  Players
agree what dictionary to use on a game-by-game basis, though the
OSPD is encouraged.  There are even commands to enable kibitzing,
if watching rather than playing is what you're into.

<p>
Come by and try it out.  We have all skill levels of players, and
we welcome more!
