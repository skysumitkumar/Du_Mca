Theta is the angle off horizontal.

<p>
Minimize length = A/cos(theta) + B/sin(theta)

<pre>
    d(length)/d(theta)
           = A*sin(theta)/cos(theta)^2 - B*cos(theta)/sin(theta)^2 (?)
           = 0
    A*sin(theta)/cos(theta)^2 = B*cos(theta)/sin(theta)^2

    B/A = sin(theta)^3/cos(theta()^3 = tan(theta)^3

    theta = inverse_tan(cube_root(B/A))
</pre>
If you use the trigonometric formulas  cos^2 x = 1/(1 + tan^2 x)
and  sin x = tan x cos x, and plug through the algebra, I believe
that the formula for the length reduces to

<pre>
(A^(2/3) + B^(2/3))^(3/2)
</pre>

At any rate this is symmetric in A and B as one would expect, and
has the right values at A=B and as either A--&gt;0 or B--&gt;0.
