<h1>Solution to the /language/english/spoonerisms problem</h1>

Original by Spooner himself:

I am afraid you have tasted the whole worm, and must
therefore take the next town drain.

Some years ago in the Parliament, a certain member known for his quick and
rapier wit, cut across a certain other member who was trying to make some
bad joke.  He called him a "Shining Wit" then apologized for making a
Spoonerism.

Another famous broadcast fluff was on the Canadian Broadcasting
Corporation, which an announcer identified as the "Canadian
Broadcorping Castration."

Oh yes, another radio announcer one that has sort of crept into
common English usage is "one swell foop".

A friend of mine had just eaten dinner in the school
cafeteria, and he didn't look very happy. Another of
my friends said, "John, what's wrong?" Knowing exactly
what he was saying, he said, "It's the bound grief I
had for dinner!"

A radio announcer, talking about a royal visit (or some such) said the
visitor would be greeted with a "twenty one sun galoot".

There are several fractured fables based on spoonerisms, such as:

A king on a desert island was so beloved by his people, they decided to
give him a very special gift for the anniversary of his coronation.  So
after much thought, they decided to make him a throne out of seashells,
which were plentiful on the island.  And when it was finished, they
presented it to the king, who loved it.  But he soon discovered it was
very uncomfortable to sit on.  So he told his subjects it was too
special to use everyday (so as not to hurt their feelings) and put it in
the attic of his palace (which was, of course, a hut like all the other
dwellings on the island), planning to use it just for special occasions.
But that night, it fell through the ceiling of his bedroom and landed
on top of him, killing him instantly.  And the moral of the story is: 
Those who live in grass houses shouldn't stow thrones!
