<h2>icecubes</h2>
You have an old-fashioned refrigerator with a small freezer compartment
which could hold seven ice cube trays stacked vertically, but there are
no shelves to separate the trays.  You have an unlimited supply of trays,
each of which can make a dozen cubes, but if you stand one on top of
another before it's frozen, it will nest part way into it and you won't
get full cubes from the bottom tray.  So, what is the fastest way to
make ice cubes?

<h2>microwave</h2>
Every morning when I warm my milk for breakfast, I put one cup of milk
in the microwave (which is in working order) for exactly 84 seconds.  Why?

<h2>snooze</h2>
Why is it very common to have a 9 minute snooze interval on alarm clocks, 
why not 10 instead ?
