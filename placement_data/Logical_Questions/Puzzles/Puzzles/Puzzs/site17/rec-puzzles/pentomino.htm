<h1>Solution to the /geometry/pentomino problem</h1>
<hr>
I've seen several different naming schemes used for pentominoes. This is
the system I'm using (I think only F &amp; N require a bit of imagination):
<pre>
 FF  I  L    N  PP  TTT  U U  V   V  W W W  X X   Y  ZZ
FF   I  L   NN  PP   T   UUU   V V    W W    X   YY   Z
 F   I  L   N   P    T          V           X X   Y   ZZ
     I  LL  N                                     Y
</pre>
A 3x20 solution (the other solution is easily obtained by a rotation of 
the section from the Z to the L inclusive):
<pre>
  UUXPPPZYYYYWTFNNNVVV
  UXXXPPZZZYWWTFFFNNLV
  UUXIIIIIZWWTTTFLLLLV
</pre>
A 4x15 solution:
<pre>
  IIIIINNLLLLTVVV
  UUXNNNFZZWLTTTV
  UXXXYFFFZWWTPPV
  UUXYYYYFZZWWPPP
</pre>
2 5x6 rectangles. Joined side-to-side, end-to-end, or stacked, these
enable construction of the 6x10 &amp; 5x12 rectangles, and the 2x5x6 prism:

<pre>
  NFVVV  YYYYI
  NFFFV  LLYZI
  NNFXV  LZZZI
  PNXXX  LZWTI
  PPUXU  LWWTI
  PPUUU  WWTTT
</pre>

The 2x3x10 and 3x4x5 solutions are tricky to show - I hope these diagrams
make sense:

<p>
A 2x3x10 solution (shown as 2 layers; Y and L are shared between the
2 layers):
<pre>
  VVVZIIIIIF    UUXTTTWWPP
  VZZZNNNFFF    UXXXTWWPPP
  VZYYYYNNFL    UUXYTWLLLL
</pre>
A 3x4x5 solution (3 layers, V F W &amp; L shared between 2 or more layers): 

<pre>
  VUUXF   VZFFF   VNYFW
  VUXXX   TZZZW   NNYPW
  VUUXW   TTTZW   NYYPP
  IIIII   TLLLL   NLYPP
