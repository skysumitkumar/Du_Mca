<h1>Solution to the /competition/games/othello problem</h1>

<p>
As of 1992, the best Othello programs may have reached or surpassed the
best human players [2][3].  As early as 1980 Jonathon Cerf, then World
Othello Champion, remarked:
<blockquote>
    "In my opinion the top programs [...] are now equal (if not superior)
     to the best human players." [1]
</blockquote>
However, Othello's game theoretic value, unlike checkers, will likely
remain unknown for quite some time.  Barring some unforeseen shortcut or
bankroll, a perfect Othello playing program would need to search in the
neighborhood of 50 plies.  Today, even a general 30 ply search to end the
game, i.e. 30 remaining empty squares, is beyond reach.

<p>
Furthermore, the game of Othello does not lend itself to endgame database
techniques that have proven so effective in checkers, and in certain chess
endgames.


<p>
Progress of the best Othello computer programs:

<dl>
<dt> 1980
<dd>     "Iago" (by Rosenbloom) [2]

<dt> 1990
<dd>   "Bill 3.0" (by Lee and Mahajan) [3] uses:
<ol>
       <li> sophisticated searching and timing algorithms, e.g. iterative
          deepening, hash/killer tables, zero-window search.
       <li> lookup tables to encode positional evaluation knowledge.
       <li> Bayesian learning for the evaluation function.
</ol>
    The average middle game search depth is 8 plies.
    Exhaustive endgame search within tournament-play time constraints, is
        usually possible with 13 to 15 empty squares remaining.
    "Bill 3.0" defeated Brian Rose, the highest rated American Othello
        player, by a score of 56-8.

<dt> 1992
<dd>    At the 4th AST Computer Olympiad [4][5], the top three programs were:
	<pre>
Othel du Nord (France)
Aida          (The Netherlands)
Jacp'Oth      (France)
</pre>
