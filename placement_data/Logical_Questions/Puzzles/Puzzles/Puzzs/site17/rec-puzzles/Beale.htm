<h1>Solution to the /cryptology/Beale problem</h1>
<hr>
The Beale ciphers are one of the greatest unsolved puzzles of all
time.  About 100 years ago, a fellow by the name of Beale supposedly
buried two wagons-full of silver-coin filled pots in Bedford County,
near Roanoke.  There are local rumors about the treasure being buried
near Bedford Lake.

<p>
He wrote three encoded letters telling what was buried, where it was
buried, and who it belonged to.  He entrusted these three letters to a
friend and went west.  He was never heard from again.

<p>
Several years later, someone examined the letters and was able to break
the code used in the second letter.  The code used the text from the
Declaration of Independence.  A number in the letter indicated which
word in the document was to be used.  The first letter of that word
replaced the number.  For example, if the first three words of the
document were "We hold these truths", the number 3 in the letter would
represent the letter t.

<p>
One of the remaining letters supposedly contains directions on how to find
the treasure.  To date, no one has solved the code.  It is believed that
both of the remaining letters are encoded using either the same document
in a different way, or another very public document.

<p>
I have deposited in the county of Bedford about four miles from
Bufords in an excavation or vault six feet below the surface
of the ground the following articles belonging jointly to
the parties whose names are given in number three herewith.
The first deposit consisted of ten hundred and fourteen pounds
of gold and thirty eight hundred and twelve pounds of silver
deposited Nov eighteen nineteen.  The second was made Dec
eighteen twenty one and consisted of nineteen hundred and seven
pounds of gold and twelve hundred and eighty eight of silver,
also jewels obtained in St. Louis in exchange to save transportation 
and valued at thirteen [t]housand dollars.  The above 
is securely packed i[n] [i]ron pots with iron cov[e]rs.  Th[e] vault
is roughly lined with stone and the vessels rest on solid stone 
and are covered [w]ith others.  Paper number one describes th[e]
exact locality of the va[u]lt so that no difficulty will be had
in finding it.

<p>
CLEAR for part 2, using only the first 480 words of the 
Declaration of Independence, then blanks filled in by
inspection.  ALL mistakes shown were caused by sloppy 
encryption.

<p>
Evidence in favor of a hoax-
<ul>
<li> Too many players.
<li> Inflated quantities of treasure.
<li> Many discrepancies exist in all documents.
<li> The Declaration of Independence is too hokey a key.
<li> Part 3 (list of 30 names) considered too little text.
<li> W.F. Friedman couldn't crack it.
<li> Why even encrypt parts 1 &amp; 3?
<li> Why use multi-part text, and why different keys for each part?
<li> Difficult to keep treasure in ground if 30 men know where it was buried.
<li> Who'd leave it with other than your own family?
<li> The Inn Keeper waited an extra 10 years before opening box with
<li>  ciphers in it?  Who would do this, curiousity runs too deep in
<li>  humans?
<li> Why did anybody waste time deciphering paper 2, which had no title?
<li>  1 &amp; 3 had titles! These should have been deciphered first?
<li> Why not just one single letter?
<li> Statistical analysis show 1&amp;3 similar in very obscure ways, that
<li>  2 differs.  Did somebody else encipher it?  And why?
<li>  Check length of keytexts, and forward/backward next word
<li>  displacement selections.
<li> Who could cross the entire country with that much gold and only
<li>  10 men and survive back then?
<li> Practically everybody who visited New Mexico before 1821, left
<li>  by way of the Pearly Gates, as the Spanish got almost every
<li>  tourist:-)
