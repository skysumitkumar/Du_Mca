<h1>Solution to the /lateral/14 problem</h1>
<hr>
     The dish that the two men ordered was albatross.  They had been 
     stranded many years earlier on a desert island.  When the man tasted 
     albatross he realized that he had never tasted it before.  This meant 
     that the meat he had been given on the island was not albatross as he 
     had been told.  He correctly deduced that he had eaten the flesh of 
     his son who had died when they first reached the island.

     This has something in common with No. 9 above but is in my opinion 
     even better.  It is fiendishly difficult to figure out from a standing 
     start.  A beautiful aspect of this problem is the subtle fact that he 
     shot himself because he did not recognise the taste of the dish!
