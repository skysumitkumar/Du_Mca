<h1>Analysis</h1>
<hr>
<h2>bicycle</h2>
A boy, a girl and a dog go for a 10 mile walk.  The boy and girl can
walk at 2 mph and the dog can trot at 4 mph.  They also have a bicycle
which only one of them (including the dog!) can use at a time.  When
riding, the boy and girl can travel at 12 mph while the dog can pedal
at 16 mph.  What is the shortest time in which all three can complete
the trip?

<h2>boy.girl.dog</h2>
A boy, a girl and a dog are standing together on a long, straight road.
Simulataneously, they all start walking in the same direction:
The boy at 4 mph, the girl at 3 mph, and the dog trots back and forth
between them at 10 mph.  Assume all reversals of direction instantaneous.
In one hour, where is the dog and in which direction is he facing?

<h2>bugs</h2>
Four bugs are placed at the corners of a square.  Each bug walks always
directly toward the next bug in the clockwise direction.  How far do
the bugs walk before they meet?

<h2>c.infinity</h2>
What function is zero at zero, strictly positive elsewhere, infinitely
differentiable at zero and has all zero derivatives at zero?

<a href="c.infinity.htm" tppabs="http://rec-puzzles.org/sol.pl/analysis/c.infinity">Solution</a>
<h2>cache</h2>
Cache and Ferry (How far can a truck go in a desert?)
A pick-up truck is in the desert beside N 50-gallon gas drums, all full.
The truck's gas tank holds 10 gallons and is empty.  The truck can carry
one drum, whether full or empty, in its bed.  It gets 10 miles to the gallon.
How far away from the starting point can you drive the truck?

<h2>calculate.pi</h2>
How can I calculate many digits of pi?

<h2>cats.and.rats</h2>
If 6 cats can kill 6 rats in 6 minutes, how many cats does it take to
kill 100 rats in 50 minutes?

<h2>dog</h2>
A body of soldiers form a 50m-by-50m square ABCD on the parade
ground.  In a unit of time, they march forward 50m in formation to
take up the position DCEF. The army's mascot, a small dog, is
standing next to its handler at location A. When the soldiers start
marching, the dog begins to run around the moving body in a clockwise
direction, keeping as close to it as possible.  When one unit of time
has elapsed, the dog has made one complete circuit and has got back
to its handler, who is now at location D. (We can assume the dog runs
at a constant speed and does not delay when turning the corners.)

          B----C----E

          A----D----F
</pre>
How far does the dog travel?

<h2>e.and.pi</h2>
Without finding their numerical values, which is greater, e^(pi) or (pi)^e?

<a href="e.and.pi.htm" tppabs="http://rec-puzzles.org/sol.pl/analysis/e.and.pi">Solution</a>
<h2>functional/distributed</h2>
     Find all f: R -> R, f not identically zero, such that
<pre>
     f( (x+y)/(x-y) ) = ( f(x)+f(y) )/( f(x)-f(y) ).
</pre>

<a href="distributed.htm" tppabs="http://rec-puzzles.org/sol.pl/analysis/functional/distributed">Solution</a>
<h2>functional/linear</h2>
Suppose f is non-decreasing with
  f(x+y) = f(x) + f(y) + C   for all real x, y.
Prove: there is a constant A such that f(x) = Ax - C  for all x.
(Note: continuity of f is not assumed in advance.)

<a href="linear.htm" tppabs="http://rec-puzzles.org/sol.pl/analysis/functional/linear">Solution</a>
<h2>integral</h2>
If f is integrable on (0,inf) and differentiable at 0, and a > 0, and:
<pre>

      inf           f(x)
   Int        ----------------  dx is defined
       0             x
</pre>
show:
<pre>
      inf     ( f(x) - f(ax) )  
   Int        ----------------  dx   = f(0) ln(a)
       0             x
</pre>

<h2>irrational.stamp</h2>
You have an ink stamp which is so amazingly precise that, when inked
and pressed down on the plane, it makes every circle of irrational
radius (centered at the center of the stamp) black.

Question:  Can one use the stamp three times and make every point
in the plane black?  [assume plane was white to begin with, and
ignore the fact that no such stamp is physically possible]

<h2>minimum.time</h2>
N people can walk or drive in a two-seater to go from city A to city B.  What
is the minimum time required to do so?

<a href="minimum.time.htm" tppabs="http://rec-puzzles.org/sol.pl/analysis/minimum.time">Solution</a>
<h2>particle</h2>
What is the longest time that a particle can take in travelling between two
points if it never increases its acceleration along the way and reaches the
second point with speed V?

<a href="particle.htm" tppabs="http://rec-puzzles.org/sol.pl/analysis/particle">Solution</a>
<h2>period</h2>
What is the least possible integral period of the sum of functions
of periods 3 and 6?

<h2>rubberband</h2>
A bug walks down a rubber band which is attached to a wall at one end and a car
moving away from the wall at the other end. The car is moving at 1 m/sec while
the bug is only moving at 1 cm/sec. Assuming the rubber band is uniformly and
infinitely elastic, will the bug ever reach the car?

<a href="rubberband.htm" tppabs="http://rec-puzzles.org/sol.pl/analysis/rubberband">Solution</a>
<h2>sequence</h2>
Show that in the sequence: x, 2x, 3x, .... (n-1)x (x can be any real number)
there is at least one number which is within 1/n of an integer.

<a href="sequence.htm" tppabs="http://rec-puzzles.org/sol.pl/analysis/sequence">Solution</a>
<h2>snow</h2>
Snow starts falling before noon on a cold December day.  At noon a
snow plow starts plowing a street.  It travels 1 mile in the first hour,
and 1/2 mile in the second hour.  What time did the snow start
falling??

You may assume that the plow's rate of travel is inversely proportional
to the height of the snow, and that the snow falls at a uniform rate.

<h2>tower</h2>
R = N ^ (N ^ (N ^ ...)).  What is the maximum N>0 that will yield a finite R?
