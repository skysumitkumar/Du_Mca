<h1>Solution to the /arithmetic/digits/most.significant/powers problem</h1>
<hr>
2^N begins with 603245 iff 603246*10^m &gt; 2^N &gt;= 603245*10^m for some
positive integer m ==&gt; m+log(603246) &gt; N*log(2) &gt;= m+log(603245);
so 2^N begins with 603245 iff frac(log(603246)) &gt; frac(N*log(2))
&gt;= frac(log(603245)).  If we are using natural density then N*log(2)
is uniformly distributed mod 1 since log(2) is irrational, hence the
probability is frac(log(603246)) - frac(log(603245)) =
frac(log(603246)-log(603245)) = frac(log(603246/603245)).

<p>
A neat observation is that since it is known p_n*c, where p_n is the
nth prime and c is irrational, is uniformly distributed mod 1, we get
the same answer if we replace 2^N with 2^{p_n}.
