<h1>Solution to the /analysis/functional/linear problem</h1>
<hr>
By induction f(mx) = m(f(x)+C)-C.  Let x=1/n, m=n and find that
f(1/n) = (1/n)(f(1)+C)-C.  Now let x=1/n and find that f(m/n) =
(m/n)(f(1)+C)-C.  f(-x+x) = f(-x) + f(x) + C ==&gt; f(-x) = -2C - f(x)
(since f(0) = -C) ==&gt; f(-m/n) = -(m/n)(f(1)+C)-C.  Since f is
monotonic ==&gt; f(x) = x*(f(1)+C)-C for all real x (Squeeze Theorem).
