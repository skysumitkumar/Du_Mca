<h1>Solution to the /geometry/lattice/equilateral problem</h1>
<hr>
No.  

<p>
Suppose 2 of the vertices are (a,b) and (c,d), where a,b,c,d are integers.
Then the 3rd vertex lies on the line defined by

<pre>
    (x,y) = 1/2 (a+c,b+d) + t ((d-b)/(c-a),-1)    (t any real number)
</pre>
and since the triangle is equilateral, we must have
<pre>
    ||t ((d-b)/(c-a),-1)|| = sqrt(3)/2 ||(c,d)-(a,b)||
</pre>
which yields t = +/- sqrt(3)/2 (c-a).  Thus the 3rd vertex is
<pre>
    1/2 (a+c,b+d) +/- sqrt(3)/2 (d-b,a-c)
</pre>
which must be irrational in at least one coordinate.
