<h1>Solution to the /geometry/dissections/square.five problem</h1>
<hr>
<ol>
<li> Prove you can reflect points which lie on the sides of the square
about the diagonals.

<li> Construct two different rectangles whose vertices lie on the square
and whose sides are parallel to the diagonals.

<li> Construct points A, A', B, B' on one (extended) side of the square
such that A/A' and B/B' are mirror image pairs with respect to another
side of the square.

<li> Construct the mirror image of the center of the square in one
of the sides.

<li> Divide the original square into 4 equal squares whose sides are
parallel to the sides of the original square.

<li> Divide one side of the square into 8 equal segments.

<li> Construct a trapezoid in which one base is a square side and one
base is 5/8 of the opposite square side.

<li> Divide one side of the square into 5 equal segments.

<li> Divide the square into 5 equal rectangles.
