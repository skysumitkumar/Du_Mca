<h1>Solution to the /arithmetic/clock/palindromic problem</h1>
<hr>
The problem is underspecified.  Digital clocks may run from

<pre>
	(a) 1:00 to 12:59
	(b) 01:00 to 12:59
	(c) 0:00 to 23:59
	(d) 00:00 to 23:59
	(e-h) any of the above with seconds appended, :00 to :59.
</pre>
I agree that not all of these are common, but I have seen some uncommon
ones.  For that matter, I've seen ones not on the above list -- the Toronto
subway stations used to contain digital clocks that ran from 0:00 to 12:59
(pm), then from 1:00 (pm) to 11:59 (pm), while a computer that I used to
use had the inverse anomaly -- its time of day command displayed times
from 12:00:00 to 12:59:59 (am), then 01:00:00 to 23:59:59!

<p>
I get the following results for the 8 cases.
