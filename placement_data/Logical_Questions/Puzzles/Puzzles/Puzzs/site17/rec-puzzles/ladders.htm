<h1>Solution to the /geometry/ladders problem</h1>
<hr>
Ladders 1 and 2, denoted L1 and L2, respectively, will rest along two
walls (taken to be perpendicular to the ground), and they will
intersect at a point O = (a,s), a height s from the ground.  Find the
largest s such that this is possible.  Then find the width of the
alley, w = a+b, in terms of L1, L2, and s.  This diagram is not to
scale.

<hr>
Without loss of generality, let L2 &gt;= L1.

<p>
Observe that triangles AOB and DOC are similar.  Let r be the ratio of
similitude, so that x=ry.  Consider right triangles CAB and ACD.  By
the Pythagorean theorem, L1^2 - x^2 = L2^2 - y^2.  Substituting x=ry,
this becomes y^2(1-r^2) = L2^2 - L1^2.  Letting L= L2^2 -L1^2 (L&gt;=0),
and factoring, this becomes

<pre>
    (*)   y^2 (1+r)(1-r) = L
</pre>

Now, because parallel lines cut L1 (a transversal) in proportion, r =
x/y = (L1-n)/n, and so  L1/n = r+1.  Now, x/s = L1/n = r+1, so ry = x =
s(r+1).  Solving for r, one obtains the formula r = s/(y-s).
Substitute this into (*) to get

<pre>
    (**)  y^2 (y) (y-2s) = L (y-s)^2
</pre>
NOTE:  Observe that, since L&gt;=0, it must be true that y-2s&gt;=0.

<p>
Now, (**) defines a fourth degree polynomial in y.  It can be written in the
form (by simply expanding (**))

<pre>
    (***)  y^4 - 2s_y^3 - L_y^2 + 2sL_y - Ls^2 = 0
</pre>
L1 and L2 are given, and so L is a constant.  How large can s be?  Given L,
the value s=k is possible if and only if there exists a real solution, y',
to (***), such that 2k &lt;= y' &lt; L2.  Now that s has been chosen, L and s are
constants, and (***) gives the desired value of y.  (Make sure to choose the
value satisfying 2s &lt;= y' &lt; L2.  If the value of s is "admissible" (i.e.,
feasible), then there will exist exactly one such solution.)
Now, w = sqrt(L2^2 - y^2), so this concludes the solution.

<p>
L1 = 11, L2 = 13, s = 4.  L = 13^2-11^2 = 48, so (***) becomes

<pre>
   y^4 - 8_y^3 - 48_y^2 + 384_y - 768 = 0
</pre>
Numerically find root y ~= 9.70940555, which yields w ~= 8.644504.
