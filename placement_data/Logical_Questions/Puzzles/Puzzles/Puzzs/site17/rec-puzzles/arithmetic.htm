<h2>7-11</h2>
<pre>A customer at a 7-11 store selected four items to buy, and was told
that the cost was $7.11.  He was curious that the cost was the same
as the store name, so he inquired as to how the figure was derived.
The clerk said that he had simply multiplied the prices of the four
individual  items.  The customer  protested  that  the four  prices     
should have been ADDED,  not MULTIPLIED.  The  clerk said that that
was OK with him, but, the result was still the same: exactly $7.11.

What were the prices of the four items?
