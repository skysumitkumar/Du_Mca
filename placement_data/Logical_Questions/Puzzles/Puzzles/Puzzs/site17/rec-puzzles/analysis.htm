<h2>bicycle</h2>
<pre>A boy, a girl and a dog go for a 10 mile walk.  The boy and girl can
walk at 2 mph and the dog can trot at 4 mph.  They also have a bicycle
which only one of them (including the dog!) can use at a time.  When
riding, the boy and girl can travel at 12 mph while the dog can pedal
at 16 mph.  What is the shortest time in which all three can complete
the trip?

<h2>boy.girl.dog</h2>
<pre>A boy, a girl and a dog are standing together on a long, straight road.
Simultaneously, they all start walking in the same direction:
The boy at 4 mph, the girl at 3 mph, and the dog trots back and forth
between them at 10 mph.  Assume all reversals of direction instantaneous.
In one hour, where is the dog and in which direction is he facing?

<h2>dog</h2>
<pre>A body of soldiers form a 50m-by-50m square ABCD on the parade ground.
In a unit of time, they march forward 50m in formation to take up the
position DCEF. The army's mascot, a small dog, is standing next to its
                                       handler at location A. When the
          B----C----E                  soldiers start marching, the dog
          |    |    |   forward-->     begins to run around the moving
          A----D----F                  body in a clockwise direction,
                                       keeping as close to it as possible.
When one unit of time has elapsed, the dog has made one complete
circuit and has got back to its handler, who is now at location D. (We
can assume the dog runs at a constant speed and does not delay when
turning the corners.)

How far does the dog travel?
