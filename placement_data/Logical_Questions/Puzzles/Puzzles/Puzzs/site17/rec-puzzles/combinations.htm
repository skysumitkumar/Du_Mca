The meaning of each entry is as follows:
If you wish to make change for 50 cents using only pennies, nickels and dimes,
go to the .10 row and the 50 column to obtain 36 ways to do this.

<p>
To calculate each entry, you start with the pennies.  There is exactly one
way to make change for every amount.  Then calculate the .05 row by adding 
the number of ways to make change for the amount using pennies plus the number
of ways to make change for five cents less using nickels and pennies.  This 
continues on for all denominations of coins.  

<p>
An example, to get change for 75 cents using all coins up to a .50, add the
number of ways to make change using only .25 and down (121) and the number of
ways to make change for 25 cents using coins up to .50 (13).  This yields the
answer of 134.
