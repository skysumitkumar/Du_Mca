<h1>Solution to the /combinatorics/subsets problem</h1>
<hr>
There are 2^10 = 1,024 subsets of the 10 integers, but there can be only 901
possible sums, the number of integers between the minimum and maximum sums.
With more subsets than possible sums, there must exist at least one sum that
corresponds to at least two subsets.  Call two subsets with equal sums A and B.
Let C = A intersect B; define S = A - C, T = B - C.  Then S is disjoint from T,
and sum(S) = sum(A-C) = sum(A) - sum(C) = sum(B) - sum(C) = sum(B-C) = sum(T).
QED

<p>
Addendum: 9 integers suffice.  This was part of my Westinghouse project
in 1981 (the above problem was in Martin Gardner's Scientific American
column not long before).  The argument is along the same lines, but
a bit more complicated; for starters you only work with the subsets
consisting of 3, 4, 5, or 6 of the 9 elements.

<p>
Let M(n) be the smallest integer such that there exists an n-element
set {a1,a2,a3,...,an=M(n)} of positive integers all 2^n of whose
subsums are distinct.  The pigeonhole argument of subsets.s shows that
M(n)&gt;2^n/n, and it is known that M(n)&gt;c*2^n/sqrt(n) for some c&gt;0.
It is still an unsolved problem (with an Erdos bounty) whether
there is a positive constant c such that M(n)&gt;c*2^n for all n.
