such that all permutations without repetitions of n letters can be formed
by placing n dice together in a line?

the first to match the second, and replace the pair in the urn.  What is the
expected time until the balls are all the same color?

<h2>full</h2>
<pre>Consider a string that contains all substrings of length n.  For
example, for binary strings with n=2, a shortest string is 00110 -- it
contains 00, 01, 10 and 11 as substrings.  Find the shortest such
strings for all n.

<h2>gossip</h2>

and exchange all the information they know (so that after the call they both
know anything that either of them knew before the call).  What is the smallest
number of calls needed so that everyone knows everything?

<h2>subsets</h2>
<pre>Out of the set of integers 1,...,100 you are given ten different
integers.  From this set, A, of ten integers you can always find two
disjoint non-empty subsets, S & T, such that the sum of elements in S
equals the sum of elements in T.  Note: S union T need not be all ten
elements of A.  Prove this.
