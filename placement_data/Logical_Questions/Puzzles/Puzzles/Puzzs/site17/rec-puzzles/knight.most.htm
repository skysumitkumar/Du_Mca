<h1>Solution to the /competition/games/chess/knight.most problem</h1>
<hr>
n^2/2 for n even &gt;= 4.

<p>
Divide the board in parts of 2x4 squares. The squares within
each part are paired as follows:

<pre>
-----
|A|B|
-----
|C|D|
-----
|B|A|
-----
|D|C|
-----
</pre>
Clearly, not more than one square per pair can be occupied by a knight.
