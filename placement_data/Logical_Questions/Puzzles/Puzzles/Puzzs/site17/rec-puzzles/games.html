<a name="hi-q"><h2>hi-q</h2></a>
What is the quickest solution of the game Hi-Q (also called Solitaire)?

For those of you who aren't sure what the game looks like:

32 movable pegs ("+") are arranged on the following board such that
only the middle position is empty ("-"). Just to be complete: the board
consists of only these 33 positions.
<pre>

	  1 2 3 4 5 6 7
	1     + + +
	2     + + +
	3 + + + + + + +
	4 + + + - + + +
	5 + + + + + + +
	6     + + +
	7     + + +
</pre>
A piece moves on this board by jumping over one of its immediate
neighbor (horizontally or vertically) into an empty space opposite.
The peg that was jumped over, is hit and removed from the board.  A
move can contain multiple hits if you use the same peg to make the
hits.

You have to end with one peg exactly in the middle position (44).

<h2>think.and.jump</h2>
first think, then jump until you are left with one peg!
<p>
<b>board description:</b>
Below is a model of the Think & Jump board.  The O's represent holes which
contain pegs.
<pre>
         O - O   O - O
        / \ / \ / \ / \
       O---O---O---O---O
        \ / \ / \ / \ /
     O---O---O---O---O---O
    / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \
   O---O---O---O---O---O---O
    \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ /

<b>directions:</b>  To play this brain teaser, you begin    
             by removing the center peg.  Then,     
             moving any direction in the grid,     
             jump over one peg at a time,         
             removing the jumped peg - until only
             one peg is left.  It's harder then it looks. 
	     But it's more fun than you can imagine.
<p>
<b>skill chart:</b>
<ul>
<li>	10 pegs left - getting better
<li>	 5 pegs left - true talent
<li>	 1 peg  left - you're a genius
</ul>
