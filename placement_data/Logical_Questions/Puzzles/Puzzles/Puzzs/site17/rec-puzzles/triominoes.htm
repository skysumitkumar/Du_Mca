There is only one way to remove a square, aside from rotations and
reflections.  To see that there is at most one way, do this:  Label
all the squares of the chessboard with A, B or C in sequence by rows
starting from the top:

<pre>
   ABCABCAB
   CABCABCA
   BCABCABC
   ABCABCAB
   CABCABCA
   BCABCABC
   ABCABCAB
   CABCABCA
</pre>
Every triomino must cover one A, one B and one C.  There is one extra
A square, so an A must be removed.  Now label the board again by
rows starting from the bottom:

<pre>
   CABCABCA
   ABCABCAB
   BCABCABC
   CABCABCA
   ABCABCAB
   BCABCABC
   CABCABCA
   ABCABCAB
</pre>
The square removed must still be an A.  The only squares that got
marked with A both times are these:

<pre>
   ........
   ........
   ..A..A..
   ........
   ........
   ..A..A..
   ........
   ........
</pre>
