<hr>
Fourteen knights are required to attack every square:
<pre>

    1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
   ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___
h |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |  
   --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
g |   |   | N | N | N | N |   |   |
   --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
f |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
   --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---

   --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
d |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |

   --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---

   --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
a |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
   --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
</pre>
Three knights are needed to attack h1, g2, and a8; two more for b1, a2,
and b3, and another two for h7, g8, and f7.

<p>
The only alternative pattern is:
<pre>
    1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
   ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___
h |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |

g |   |   | N |   |   | N |   |   |
   --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
f |   |   | N | N | N | N |   |   |
   --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
e |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
   --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
d |   |   | N | N | N | N |   |   |
   --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
c |   | N | N |   |   | N | N |   |
   --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
b |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
   --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
a |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
   --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
</pre>
Twelve knights are needed to control (attack or occupy) the board:
<pre>
    1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
   ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___
a |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |  
   --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
b |   |   | N |   |   |   |   |   |
   --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
c |   |   | N | N |   | N | N |   |
   --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
d |   |   |   |   |   | N |   |   |
   --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
e |   |   | N |   |   |   |   |   |
   --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
f |   | N | N |   | N | N |   |   |
   --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
g |   |   |   |   |   | N |   |   |
   --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
h |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
   --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
</pre>
Each knight can control at most one of the twelve squares a1, b1, b2,
h1, g1, g2, a8, b8, b7, h8, g8, g7.  This position is unique up to
reflection.
