<h1>Solution to the /geometry/spiral problem</h1>
<hr>
If `s' is our speed in the northwest direction, then the speed we
approach the pole is s/sqrt(2), no matter where we are on the earth.
<p>
Starting on the equator, the distance to the pole is about 20038 kilometers,
so the length of the path travelled by going northwest is about 
20038 sqrt(2) = 28338 kilometers.
<p>
The path spirals around the pole an infinite number of times, but it still
has a finite length. 
<p>
<em>Note: this solution is different than the answer from the original
archive, that stated that it would be impossible to reach to North Pole
by going northwest. The argument being that it would imply that you
could leave the North Pole by going southeast. Since from the North Pole
all directions are due south this would be impossible. 
<p>
The original answer is flawed. The spiral path is not differentiable
at the North Pole, so it doesn't make sense to talk about the direction 
at that point.
