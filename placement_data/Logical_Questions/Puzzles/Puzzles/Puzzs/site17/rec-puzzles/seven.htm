<h1>Solution to the /arithmetic/tests.for.divisibility/seven problem</h1>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>
Take the last digit (n mod 10) and double it.
<li>
Take the rest of the digits (n div 10) and subtract the doubled last
    digit from it.
</ul>
The resulting number is divisible by 7 iff the original number
    is divisible by 7.

<pre>
Example:  Take 53445
          Subtract (53445 mod 10) * 2 from (53445 div 10)
                           -  5  * 2   +   5344
                            = 5334
	  533 - 2 * 4 = 525
	  52 - 5 * 2 = 42 which is divisible by 7
          so 53445 is divisible by 7.
