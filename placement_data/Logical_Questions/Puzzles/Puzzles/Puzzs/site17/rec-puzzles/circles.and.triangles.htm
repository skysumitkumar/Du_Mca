<h1>Solution to the /geometry/circles.and.triangles problem</h1>
<hr>
Let a, b, and c be the sides of the triangle.  Let s be the
semiperimeter, i.e. s = (a + b + c) / 2.  Let A be the area
of the triangle, and let x be the radius of the incircle.

<p>
Divide the triangle into three smaller triangles by drawing
a line segment from each vertex to the incenter.  The areas
of the smaller triangles are ax/2, bx/2, and cx/2.  Thus,
A = ax/2 + bx/2 + cx/2, or A = sx. 

<p>
We use Heron's formula, which is A = sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)).
This gives us x = sqrt((s-a)(s-b)(s-c)/s).

<p>
The radius of the circumscribed circle is given by R = abc/4A.
