<h1>Solution to the /arithmetic/tests.for.divisibility/three problem</h1>
<hr>
A number is divisible by three iff the sum of its digits is divisible by three.
First, prove 10^N = 1 mod 3 for all integers N &gt;= 0.
1 = 1 mod 3. 10 = 1 mod 3. 10^N = 10^(N-1) * 10 = 10^(N-1) mod 3.
QED by induction. 
<p>
Now let D[0] be the units digit of N, D[1] the tens digit, etc.
Now N = Summation From k=0 to k=inf of D[k]*10^k.
Therefore N mod 3 = Summation from k=0 to k=inf of D[k] mod 3. QED
