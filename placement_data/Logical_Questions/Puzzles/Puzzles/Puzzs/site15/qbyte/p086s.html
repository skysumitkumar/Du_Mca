Assign <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinates  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinates'" tppabs="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinates">Cartesian coordinates</a> to the vertices of the triangle: C&nbsp;=&nbsp;(0,0), B&nbsp;=&nbsp;(0,a), A&nbsp;=&nbsp;(b,0); and Y&nbsp;=&nbsp;(0,r), X&nbsp;=&nbsp;(s,0).</p>

<p>Let the equation of line CC' be y = kx, for some k &gt; 0, such that Y lies on BC and X lies on AC.&nbsp; We will express the area of&nbsp;YXC' in terms of a, b, and&nbsp;k.<br />
The equation of line AB is ax + by = ab.<br />
Hence C' = (ab/(a + bk), abk/(a + bk)).</p>
<p>By <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://mathforum.org/sum95/suzanne/symsusan.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://mathforum.org/sum95/suzanne/symsusan.html'" tppabs="http://mathforum.org/sum95/suzanne/symsusan.html" title="The four types of symmetry in the plane">symmetry</a>, CM = MC', and so M = (&frac12;ab/(a + bk), &frac12;abk/(a + bk)).</p>
<p>Also by symmetry, YX<img src="perp.gif" tppabs="http://www.qbyte.org/puzzles/perp.gif" width="19" height="12" alt="perpendicular to" />CC', and so the product of their gradients is -1.<br />
Hence the equation of line YX is y = r - x/k.</p>
<p>To find r in terms of a, b, and k, we substitute the coordinates of M into the above equation:</p>

Hence bk<sup>3</sup> + 3ak<sup>2</sup> - 3bk - a = 0.</p>
<p>By <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://mathworld.wolfram.com/DescartesSignRule.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://mathworld.wolfram.com/DescartesSignRule.html'" tppabs="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/DescartesSignRule.html">Descartes' Sign Rule</a>, this cubic equation has exactly one positive real root.</p>
<p>Substituting a = 115, b = 236, we obtain 236k<sup>3</sup> + 345k<sup>2</sup> - 708k - 115 = (4k - 5)(59k<sup>2</sup> + 160k + 23) = 0.&nbsp; (See <em>remarks</em>, below.)<br />
Hence k = 5/4 is the solution we seek.</p>
<p>Then, r = 115 &times; 236 &times; (1 + 25/16) / [(5/2) &times; (115 + (5/4)&times;236)] = 1357/20.<br />
Finally, w = &frac12;kr<sup>2</sup> = (5/8) &times; (1357/20)<sup>2</sup> = 1841449/640 = 2877.2640625.</p>
<p>It is easy to verify that, if C' is moved closer to B (so that X coincides with&nbsp;A), or if&nbsp;C' is moved closer to&nbsp;A (so that&nbsp;Y coincides with&nbsp;B), the area of&nbsp;YXC' exceeds the value of&nbsp;w, calculated above.<br />
Since w is a <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function'" tppabs="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function">continuous function</a>, and has only one turning point for k &gt; 0, it follows that k&nbsp;=&nbsp;5/4 represents a minimum.</p>

<hr /><h2 class="h3">Remarks</h2>
<p>An expression such as 236k<sup>3</sup> + 345k<sup>2</sup> - 708k - 115 cannot easily be factored by inspection!&nbsp; Although the general cubic equation can be solved analytically by hand (see references below), this can be quite a lengthy process.&nbsp; Fortunately, even if you don't own a mathematical software package, there are a number of online calculators available, such as the <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.hostsrv.com/webmab/app1/MSP/quickmath/02/pageGenerate?site=quickmath&s1=equations&s2=solve&s3=basic  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.hostsrv.com/webmab/app1/MSP/quickmath/02/pageGenerate?site=quickmath&s1=equations&s2=solve&s3=basic'" tppabs="http://www.hostsrv.com/webmab/app1/MSP/quickmath/02/pageGenerate?site=quickmath&s1=equations&s2=solve&s3=basic">QuickMath Equation Solver</a>.&nbsp; For a cubic equation with rational coefficients, this solver will provide exact solutions in terms of (possibly complex) radicals, as well as approximate numerical solutions.</p>
<p>It was noted above that the cubic equation bk<sup>3</sup> + 3ak<sup>2</sup> - 3bk - a = 0 has exactly one positive real root.&nbsp; This confirms our intuition that there can only be one turning point for the area of triangle YXC'.&nbsp; In fact, since the <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.mathwright.com/library/oldcardanoxc.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.mathwright.com/library/oldcardanoxc.html'" tppabs="http://www.mathwright.com/library/oldcardanoxc.html">discriminant</a> of the cubic is negative, there are three distinct real roots.&nbsp; When all three roots of a cubic equation are real, the formula for the roots expresses them as sums of cube roots of complex numbers.&nbsp; If you attempt to extract the cube roots of these complex numbers, you'll find you have to solve precisely the cubic equation you started with!&nbsp; This is the so-called <em>Casus Irreducibilis</em>; see reference 2, below.&nbsp; It can be shown that the roots of such a cubic equation cannot in general be expressed in terms of real radicals.</p>
<p>It is possible to solve this problem without recourse to Cartesian coordinates, by purely trigonometric means.&nbsp; Whatever approach is taken, at some point a cubic equation comparable to the one above must be solved.</p>
<p>The diagram above shows the minimum area of YXC', drawn to scale.</p>
