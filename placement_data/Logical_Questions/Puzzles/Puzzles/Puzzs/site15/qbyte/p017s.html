<h1 id="main">Solution to puzzle 17: Three children</h1>
<p>We assume that each birth is an <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/56494.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/56494.html'" tppabs="http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/56494.html">independent event</a>, for which the probability of a boy is the same as the probability of a girl.&nbsp; There are, then, three possibilities for your colleague's family, all equally likely:</p>
<ul><li>Boy, Boy, Girl</li><li>Boy, Girl, Boy</li><li>Boy, Girl, Girl</li></ul>
<p>Therefore there is a 2/3 chance that the colleague has two boys and a girl, and a 1/3 chance he has two girls and a boy.</p>
<hr /><h2 class="h3">Remarks</h2>
<p>Note that in each of the ordered triples above, BBG, BGB, BGG, the first letter represents the gender of the <em>first</em> child.&nbsp; The context of the word <em>first</em> may be chosen at our convenience.&nbsp; For example, it may be the eldest child (if we sort by descending age), the shortest (sort by ascending height), or perhaps the child whose forename is first alphabetically.&nbsp; In this case, the context we choose is &#8220;the first child we meet.&#8221;&nbsp; The second and third letters in each ordered triplet represent the genders of the other two children, neither of whom we have met.</p>
<p>Another way to arrive at the answer is to note that the boy who opens the door is essentially a red herring.&nbsp; Leaving him aside, the puzzle asks us to compare the probabilities that the other two children are (a)&nbsp;both girls, or (b)&nbsp;one girl and one boy.&nbsp; (The letter from the principal is carefully worded to leave both options open.)&nbsp; The second option (older sister, younger brother, or older brother, younger sister) is twice as likely as the first (elder sister, younger sister.)</p>
<p>As with many <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.shodor.org/interactivate/discussions/pd12.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.shodor.org/interactivate/discussions/pd12.html'" tppabs="http://www.shodor.org/interactivate/discussions/pd12.html">conditional probability</a> questions, this result may seem surprising at first.&nbsp; If you are skeptical, I urge you to carry out a simulation, either manually or programatically.&nbsp; Setting up such a simulation forces you to analyse exactly what is happening.</p>
<p>The situation can be modelled by throwing three coins.&nbsp; Let heads represent boys, and tails girls.&nbsp; One coin in each throw should be set aside to be checked whether it is a boy or a girl.&nbsp; (This corresponds to the boy who opens the door.)&nbsp; It needn't be the same coin each time, and it needn't be thrown first, but it must be chosen independently of whether it shows heads or tails.</p>
<p>One convenient method would be to throw one dime and two nickels.&nbsp; If the dime shows heads (a boy) and one or both of the nickels shows tails, we have a faithful representation of the puzzle situation.&nbsp; Other scenarios are discarded.&nbsp; Of the scenarios retained, in roughly two out of three cases there will be two heads.</p>
