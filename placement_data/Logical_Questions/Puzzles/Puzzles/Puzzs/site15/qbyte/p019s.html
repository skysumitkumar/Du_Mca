<h1 id="main">Solution to puzzle 19: Five card trick</h1>
<p>The solution presented below is possibly the simplest.&nbsp; It is not the only solution, but it perhaps demands the least mental effort from the magicians.</p>
<p>In any group of five cards, there must be at least two of the same suit.&nbsp; A selects one of the cards from a duplicate suit and hands it back to the audience member.&nbsp; The other card (or one of the others, if there is more than one) is placed first in the set of four, and will indicate the suit.</p>
<p>Next, think of the remaining three cards as <em>Low</em>, <em>Medium</em>, and <em>High</em> values (their actual values don't matter.)&nbsp; Any pre-agreed order will suffice; for example, ascending face value (Ace to King), with the suit used as a tie-breaker, if necessary.&nbsp; We could use an <em>alphabetical</em> suit order: Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, Spades.&nbsp; So, for example, 3S would come before&nbsp;7C; and, using the tie-breaker, 7C would come before&nbsp;7H.&nbsp; Hence the Low-Medium-High ordering in this case would be:&nbsp;3S,&nbsp;7C,&nbsp;7H.</p>
<p>Given Low, Medium, and High, we can encode a number between one and six as follows:<br />
<span class="i">LMH = 1, LHM = 2, MLH = 3, MHL = 4, HLM = 5, HML = 6.</span></p>
<p>This still leaves us short, as the hidden card could be one of 12.&nbsp; However, there is one opportunity to impart information we have not yet used: A gets to decide which of the cards from the duplicate suit to retain, and which to hand back to the audience member.&nbsp; How can the retained card be used to indicate more than just the suit?</p>
<p>Imagine the 13 face values (Ace to King) arranged in a circle.&nbsp; The shorter path between two cards, counting forward from one card to the other, is never more than six places.&nbsp; Therefore, A chooses to retain a card that <em>begins</em> the shorter path, and hands the other card to the audience member.&nbsp; B uses the encoded number to count forward from the first card in the hand of four.</p>
<p>Example: the audience member selects the following cards&nbsp;- 2C, 5D, JC, 5H, KS&nbsp;-&nbsp;and passes them to A.&nbsp; The only duplicate suit is clubs.&nbsp; Counting forward from JC to 2C is four places, so A retains JC and hands back 2C to the audience member.&nbsp; The first card in A's hand will therefore be JC.&nbsp; Of the other three cards, 5D is Low, 5H is Medium (using the suit tie-breaker), and KS is High.&nbsp; To represent <em>four</em>, A uses the ordering MHL.&nbsp; So the four cards are:&nbsp;JC,&nbsp;5H,&nbsp;KS,&nbsp;5D.</p>
<p>To decode, B notes that he must count forward from JC.&nbsp; He notes that the natural ordering of the other three cards is: 5D,&nbsp;5H,&nbsp;KS, and so the cards 5H,&nbsp;KS,&nbsp;5D represent ordering MHL, which encodes the number four.&nbsp; He therefore counts forward four places from JC and announces the two of clubs!</p>
<p>With a little practice, this trick can be made to flow quite smoothly.&nbsp; If performed repeatedly before the same audience, it is advisable to permute the position of the <em>suit</em> card, to make the trick harder to read.&nbsp; For example, on the <em>n</em>th performance, place the suit card in the <em>(n modulo 4)</em>th position.</p>
