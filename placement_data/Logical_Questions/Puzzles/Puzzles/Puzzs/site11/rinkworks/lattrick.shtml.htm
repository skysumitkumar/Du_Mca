In a sense, they are a hybrid between puzzles and storytelling -- the ratio of one to the other is determined by how you go about solving them.<p>In each puzzle, some basic clues to a realistic scenario are given, but the clues don't tell the full story.  Your job is to fill in the details and have the resulting scenario make sense.  Obviously, there is usually more than one answer to any given puzzle, but, in general, only the solution given is truly satisfying.  (In some cases, multiple solutions are given.)<p>You can try solving these puzzles on your own -- that's certainly a legitimate way to go about this -- but usually you can have more fun if you involve other people.  The way it works is, you look at the answer (maybe you want to try the puzzle on your own first!), then read just the clues to your friends.  Your friends must determine the answer by asking questions about it, which you may answer only with "yes," "no," or the occasional "doesn't matter."  The neat thing about this is that you can adjust the difficulty of the puzzle by varying the number of initial clues, throwing in red herrings, and so forth.<p><b>This page contains <em>Tricky Lateral Thinking Puzzles</em>.</b>  These scenarios are a little more devious than the <a href="latreal.shtml.htm" tppabs="http://rinkworks.com/brainfood/latreal.shtml"><em>Realistic Lateral Thinking Puzzles</em></a> in that the clues sometimes rely on double meanings of words, and some of the scenarios couldn't take place in a realistic world.<p>Many of these puzzles were adapted from collections by Jed Hartman and Paul Sloane.<p><b>Warning</b>:  For some reason, the situations for these puzzles have a tendency to be rather morbid.<p><hr><p><center><table border=0 cellspacing=40 cellpadding=0><tr><td><h1>#1</h1></td><td>Adults are holding children, waiting their turn.
