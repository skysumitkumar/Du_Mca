 <tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="insP"><tr><td>Neither the delivery from the Jade Empress (clue 2), Crab Shanty (5),
El Azteca (7), nor Olive Tree (10) was the 5th or 6th one made, so
the Long Branch Steak House and Bombay Grill ones were 5th and 6th or
vice versa.  Since the family on Adams St. didn't get food from the
Long Branch Steak House or Bombay Grill (1), the Crab Shanty delivery
in clue 5 couldn't have been the 3rd or 4th one Dave made and was thus
1st or 2nd.  Since the Fords didn't order from the Long Branch Steak House
or Bombay Grill (8), by clue 2, the 4th delivery wasn't from the Jade
Empress.  So, Dan's 4th delivery was from El Azteca or the Olive Tree.
If Dave's 4th delivery were from El Azteca, his 5th would have been to
the Eyres and his 6th to the house on Wilson Dr. (7).  We already know
the Crab Shanty delivery was 1st or 2nd.  If the Olive Tree delivery
had been 3rd, by clue 10, the Eyres would be the family on Clinton Rd.,
which they are not (3).  If the Jade Empress delivery had been 3rd, the
delivery to the Fords would have been 4th and to the family on Hoover
Ave. 5th (2).  Since the Ash family didn't order the Chinese food from
the Jade Empress (9), by clue 5, the Crab Shanty delivery couldn't
have been 2nd and the Olive Tree one would have, with the Crab Shanty
delivery 1st.  Then the family on Clinton Rd. would have gotten Dave's
4th delivery, and the Drews would have received the 3rd (10); by clue
10, the Drews on Adams St. would have received the 3rd, and the Ashes
would have received the 2nd delivery.  By clue 4, however, there is
no way for the delivery to the Burkes to fit into this arrangement.
So, the 4th delivery was from the Olive Tree rather than El Azteca,
with the 5th then to the Drews and the 6th to the family who live
on Clinton Rd. (10).  We already know the Crab Shanty delivery
wasn't 3rd.  If the Jade Empress delivery had been 3rd, the Fords would
have received the 4th and the the diners on Hoover Ave. the 5th (2).
Since the Ashes didn't order Chinese (9), by clue 5, the 2nd delivery
wouldn't have been from the Crab Shanty and would have been from El
Azteca; the Crab Shanty delivery would have been Dave's 1st.  Then the
Wilson Dr. address would have been Dave's 4th delivery, with the Eyres
getting their meal 3rd (7); while by clue 5, the 2nd and 3rd deliveries
would have been to the Ash family and the family on Adams St.  The Burkes
would have gotten the 6th delivery and the Clays the 1st (4).  By clue 11,
the Ash family would live on Truman Blvd.--which they do not (9).
So, the Jade Empress delivery wasn't 3rd and the El Azteca one was.
By clue 7, the Eyres received the 4th order and the Drews on Wilson Dr.
the 5th.  If the Jade Empress delivery had been 2nd, with the Fords
then 3rd and the Hoover Ave. one 4th (2), the Crab Shanty delivery would
have been 1st, the Ash family's 2nd, and the one to Adams St. 3rd (5).
Again, however, the Crab Shanty delivery would have been to the Clays
(4), with the Ashes living on Truman Blvd. (11)--no (9).  Therefore,
the 2nd delivery was from the Crab Shanty and the 1st from the Jade
Empress.  By clue 5, Dave's 3rd delivery was to the Ash family and 4th
to the Adams St. house of the Eyre family.  By clue 2, the Fords were
Dave's 2nd cutomers; and Hoover Ave. is home to the Ashes.  The Fords
reside on Reagan Way (6), and the 1st delivery was to the family on
Truman Blvd.  They are the Burkes (11), with the Clays being on Clinton
Rd.  The Clays' order was from the Bombay Grill (11) and Drews from the
Long Branch Steak House.  In sum, Dave's first six deliveries Saturday
night were as follows:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>1st - Jade Empress to the Burke family on Truman Blvd.<BR>
<LI>2nd - Crab Shanty to the Ford family on Reagan Way<BR>
<LI>3rd - El Azteca to the Ash family on Hoover Ave. <BR>
<LI>4th - Olive Tree to the Eyre family on Adams St. <BR>
<LI>5th - Long Branch Steak House to the Drew family on Wilson Dr.<BR>
<LI>6th - Bombay Grill to the Clay family on Clinton Rd.<BR>
