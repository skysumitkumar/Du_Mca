 <tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="insP"><tr><td>Three of the league owners are given in each of clues 2 and 6, so either the
clues have some commonality or they list six different men.  There isn't
complete overlap, since the Alex Rodriguez and Vladimir Guerrero picks
conflict.  The two other possible overlaps would have the Caracas Crash
picking Vladimir Guerrero--no (clue 16)--or Ed picking Alex Rodriguez--no
(10).  Therefore, clues 2 and 6 give six of the eight league members.
The three owners given in clue 14 must overlap either or both those in
clues 2 and 6 or there will be nine different men.  Since Ben didn't get
Alex Rodriguez (10) and Hal didn't pick Curt Schilling (7), the only
overlap possible between clues 2 and 14 would be that the Tokyo Fighting
Carp have Alex Rodriguez.  Between clues 2 and 14, we would have these
picks in order: Hal's, Alex Rodriguez to the Tokyo Fighting Carp, Caracas
Crash owner Ben's, and the pick of Curt Schilling.  Since the Mexico City
Diablos didn't select Curt Schilling (1), there is no overlap between
clue 6 and the four.  Therefore, for this arrangement to work, either Hal
or the Mexico City Diablos owner would have picked 1st or 2nd.  Since Ben
didn't pick 3rd (12), Hal couldn't pick 1st.  If Hal had picked 2nd, then
the order of clues 2, 6, and 14 with 2 and 14 overlapping would be Hal,
Tokyo's of Alex Rodriguez, Ben's for Caracas, the Curt Schilling selection,
the Mexico City turn, the Vladimir Guerrero pick, and Ed's pick.  By clue
17, the pick of Sammy Sosa was immediately followed by Frank's and then
Keaton's choices.  Testing the arrangement with Hal picking 2nd, Hal couldn't
have picked Sammy Sosa since Ben isn't Keaton (4); Ben couldn't have picked
Sammy Sosa since Keaton isn't the Mexico City owner (1); and Mexico City
couldn't have acquired Sammy Sosa since Frank didn't pick Vladimir Guerrero
(13).  So the above arrangement doesn't work.  The Mexico City Diablos
couldn't have picked 1st since Ed didn't pick 3rd (12).  If Mexico had
picked 2nd, the order of clues 2, 6, and 14 with 2 and 14 overlapping would
be the Mexico City turn, the Vladimir Guerrero pick, Ed's pick, Hal's choice,
Tokyo's of Alex Rodriguez, Ben's for Caracas, and the Curt Schilling selection.
Testing this arrangement with the information in clue 17, Mexico City couldn't
have picked Sammy Sosa since Frank didn't get Vladimir Guerrero (13) and Hal
couldn't have picked Sammy Sosa since Ben isn't Keaton (4).  If Sammy Sosa
had been the 1st pick and Frank had then picked 2nd, there would be no way for
clue 5, where Chad and Dan made consecutive picks, to work.  So, this
arrangement doesn't work either, and we now know clues 2 and 14 do not overlap;
clues 6 and 14 must.  Since Mexico City didn't pick Curt Schilling (1),
we have the following order of picks: Mexico City's, the Vladimir Guerrero
selection, Ed's for the Tokyo team, Ben's, and the Curt Schilling pick.
Since we already know clue 2 doesn't overlap either 6 or 14 and we have sets
of three and five men, either Hal picked 1st or the Mexico City owner did.
Since Ed didn't pick 3rd (12), the Mexico City owner couldn't have picked 1st.
Hal picked 1st, followed by the man who got Alex Rodriguez and then the
Caracas Crash owner; the five ordered above starting with the Mexico City
team then chose 4th-8th.  By clue 17, the pick of Sammy Sosa was immediately
followed by Frank's and then Keaton's choices.  Since Keaton isn't the
Caracas Crash owner (8), Hal didn't pick Sammy Sosa.  Since Frank didn't
pick Vladimir Guerrero (13), Sammy Sosa didn't go to the Mexico City Diablos.
Sammy Sosa went to the Caracas Crash, with Frank then owning the Mexico City
Diablos and Keaton choosing Vladimir Guerrero for his squad (17).  By clue 5,
Chad picked 2nd and Dan picked 3rd.  By clue 11, Art is Keaton, Ben's team is
the Vancouver Mounties, and Quarry, who must be Greg, got Curt Schilling as
his pick.  By clue 19, Barry Bonds must have been Hal's choice, with Chad
then Oswalt.  By clue 13, Frank picked Pedro Martinez and Ed Randy Johnson.
Since Dan isn't Mixer (5), by clue 21, Ed is Mixer; and Ben chose Jason Giambi.
Neither Greg (9), Art, nor Chad (20) owns the Beijing Ducks, so Hal does.
Neither Art (8) nor Greg (9) manages the Seoul Jets, so Chad does.  By clue 18,
Art has the San Juan Roughriders and Greg the Osaka Samurai.  Jenkins isn't Hal,
Ben (15), or Frank (22) and is Dan.  Then Hal is Nixon (15).  Frank is Palmer
and Ben Lemon (3).  In sum, the first round picks in the Burb Rotisserie League
were
