<h1>Solution to the /logic/smullyan/stamps problem</h1>
<hr>
B says: "Suppose I have red-red. A would have said on her 
second turn: 'I see that B has red-red. If I also have red-red, then all
four reds would be used, and C would have realized that she had green-green.
But C didn't, so I don't have red-red.  Suppose I have green-green. In that
case, C would have realized that if she had red-red, I would have seen
four reds and I would have answered that I had green-green on my first
turn.  On the other hand, if she also has green-green [we assume that
A can see C; this line is only for completeness], then B would have seen
four greens and she would have answered that she had two reds.  So C would
have realized that, if I have green-green and B has red-red, and if
neither of us answered on our first turn, then she must have green-red.
<blockquote>
  "'But she didn't. So I can't have green-green either, and if I can't have 
green-green or red-red, then I must have green-red.'
</blockquote>
  So B continues:
  
<blockquote>
  "But she (A) didn't say that she had green-red, so
the supposition that I have red-red must be wrong.  And as my logic applies
to green-green as well, then I must have green-red."
</blockquote>

  So B had green-red, and we don't know the distribution of the others
certainly.
<p>
  (Actually, it is possible to take the last step first, and deduce
that the person who answered YES must have a solution which would work
if the greens and reds were switched -- red-green.)
