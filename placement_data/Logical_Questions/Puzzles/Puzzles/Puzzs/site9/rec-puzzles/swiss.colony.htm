<h1>Solution to the /cryptology/swiss.colony problem</h1>
<hr>
Did anyone solve the 1987 'Crypto-gift' contest that was run by
Swiss Colony?  My friend and I worked on it for 4 months, but
didn't get anywhere.  My friend solved the 1986 puzzle in
about a week and won $1000.  I fear that we missed some clue that
makes it incredibly easy to solve.  I'm including the code, clues
and a few notes for those of you so inclined to give it a shot.

Notes:
The puzzle comes as a jigsaw that when assembled has the list of
numbers.  They are arranged as indicated on the puzzle, with commas.
The lower right corner has a drawing of 'Secret Agent Chris Mouse'.
He holds a box under his arm which looks like the box 
the puzzle comes in.  The upper left
corner has the words 'NEW 1987 $50,000 Puzzle'.  The lower
left corner is empty.  The clues are printed on the
entry form in upper case, with the punctuation as shown.
