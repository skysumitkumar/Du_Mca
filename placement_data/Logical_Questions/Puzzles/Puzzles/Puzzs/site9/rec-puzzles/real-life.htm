<h2>icecubes</h2>
<pre>You have an old-fashioned refrigerator with a small freezer compartment
which could hold seven ice cube trays stacked vertically, but there are
no shelves to separate the trays.  You have an unlimited supply of trays,
each of which can make a dozen cubes, but if you stand one on top of
another before it's frozen, it will nest part way into it and you won't
get full cubes from the bottom tray.  So, what is the fastest way to
make ice cubes?

<h2>lost.nuts</h2>
<pre>While changing a flat tire, all five of the tire lugs roll into a storm drain,
out of reach.  How can the car proceed to town to get some new lugs?

<h2>microwave</h2>
<pre>Every morning when I warm my milk for breakfast, I put one cup of milk
in the microwave (which is in working order) for exactly 84 seconds.  Why?

<h2>three.switches</h2>
<pre>A lightbulb is turned on by one of three switches, but you cannot see
the bulb from the switches.  How can you determine which switch turns
on the bulb if you only want to go from the switches to the bulb once?

Assume that the switches are clearly marked indicating which
orientation is on, that the lightbulb is an ordinary household
incandescent bulb, that you do not have assistants or apparatus such as
mirrors available, and in general that this is not a trick question.
