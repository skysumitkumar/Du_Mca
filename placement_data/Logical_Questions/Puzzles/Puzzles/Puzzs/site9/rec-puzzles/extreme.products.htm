<h1>Solution to the /arithmetic/digits/extreme.products problem</h1>
<hr>
There is a simple procedure which applies to these types of problems (and
which can be proven with help from the arithmetic-geometric inequality).

<p>
For the first part we use the "first large then equal" procedure.
This means that are three numbers will be 7**, 8**, and 9**.  Now
the digits 4,5,6 get distributed so as to make our three number as
close to each other as possible, i.e. 76*, 85*, 94*.  The same goes
for the remaining three digits, and we get 763, 852, 941.

<p>
For the second part we use the "first small then different" procedure.
Our three numbers will be of the form 1**, 2**, 3**.  We now place
the three digits so as to make our three numbers as unequal as possible;
this gives 14*, 25*, 36*.  Finishing, we get 147, 258, 369.

<p>
Now, *prove* that these procedures work for generalizations of this
problem.
