<h1>Solution to the /geometry/cycle.polynomial problem</h1>
<hr>
For future reference, here are the cycle polynomials for the five platonic
solids (and I threw in the tesseract for good measure).  Most combinatoric
coloring problems are simple plug-ins to these polynomials.  For details,
see any book on combinatorics that presents Polya counting theory.

<ul>
<li> tetrahedron: (x1^4+3x2^2+8x1*x3)/12
<li> cube: (x1^6+6x2^3+3x1^2*x2^2+8x3^2+6x1^2*x4)/24
<li> octahedron: (x1^8+9x2^4+8x1^2*x3^2+6x4^2)/24
<li> dodecahedron: (x1^12+15x2^6+20x3^4+24x1^2*x5^2)/60
<li> icosahedron: (x1^20+15x2^10+20x1^2*x3^6+24x5^4)/60
<li> tesseract: (32x6^4+x2^12+48x8^3+x1^24+24x1^2*x2^11+12x2^2*x4^5+32x3^8+12x4^6
    +18x1^4*x2^10+12x1^4*x4^5)/192
</ul>
