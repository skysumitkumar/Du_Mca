<p>
Lateral thinking puzzles are often strange situations which require an 
explanation.  They are solved through a dialogue between the 
quizmaster who sets the puzzle and the solver or solvers who try to 
figure out the answer.  The puzzles as stated generally do not contain 
sufficient information for the solver to uncover the solution.  So a 
key part of the process is the asking of questions.    The questions 
can receive one of only three possible answers - yes, no or 
irrelevant.
<p>     
When one line of enquiry reaches an end then another approach is 
needed, often from a completely new direction.  This is where the 
lateral thinking comes in.
<p>   
Some people find it frustrating that for any puzzle it is possible to 
construct various answers which fit the initial statement of the 
puzzle.  However, for a good lateral thinking puzzle, the proper 
answer will be the best in the sense of the most apt and satisfying.  
When you hear the right answer to a good puzzle of this type you 
should want to kick yourself for not working it out! 
<p>     
This kind of puzzle teaches you to check your assumptions about any 
situation.  You need to be open-minded, flexible and creative in your 
questioning and able to put lots of different clues and pieces of 
information together.  Once you reach a viable solution you keep going 
in order to refine it or replace it with a better solution.  This is 
lateral thinking!

<p>
This list contains some of the most renowned and representative 
lateral thinking puzzles as well as some of those which crop up most 
frequently on the rec.puzzles newgroup.

<h2>The Puzzles</h2>

<ol>
<h3><li>The man in the Elevator</h3>

A man lives on the tenth floor of a building.  Every day he takes the 
elevator to go down to the ground floor to go to work or to go 
shopping.  When he returns he takes the elevator to the seventh floor 
and walks up the stairs to reach his apartment on the tenth floor.  He 
hates walking so why does he do it?

<p>
This is probably the best known and most celebrated of all lateral 
thinking puzzles.  It is a true classic.  Although there are many 
possible solutions which fit the initial conditions, only the 
canonical answer is truly satisfying.

<h3><li> The Man in the Bar</h3>

A man walks into a bar and asks the barman for a glass of water.  The 
barman pulls out a gun and points it at the man.  The man says 'Thank 
you' and walks out.

<p>
This puzzle has claims to be the best of the genre.  It is simple in 
its statement, absolutely baffling and yet with a completely 
satisfying solution.  Most people struggle very hard to solve this one 
yet they like the answer when they hear it or have the satisfaction of 
figuring it out.

<h3><li>The Man who Hanged Himself</h3>

Not far from Madrid, there is a large wooden barn.  The barn is 
completely empty except for a dead man hanging from the middle of the 
central rafter.  The rope around his neck is ten feet long and his 
feet are three feet off the ground.  The nearest wall is 20 feet away 
from the man.  It is not possible to climb up the walls or along the 
rafters.  The man hanged himself.  How did he do it?

<h3><li>Death in a Field</h3>

A man is lying dead in a field.  Next to him there is an unopened 
package.  There is no other creature in the field.  How did he die?

<h3><li>The Coal, Carrot and Scarf</h3>

Five pieces of coal, a carrot and a scarf are lying on the lawn.

<h3><li>Trouble with Sons</h3>

A woman had two sons who were born on the same hour of the same day of 
the same year.  But they were not twins, and they were not adopted.
How could this be so?

<h3><li>The Arm of the Postal Service</h3>

One day a man received a parcel in the post.  Carefully packed inside 
was a human arm.  He examined it, repacked it and then sent it on to 
another man.  The second man also carefully examined the arm before 
taking it to the woods and burying it.  Why did they do this?

<p>
This one probably has more variations than any other.  A great one to 
puzzle out.   It requires plenty of good questions.

<h3><li>Heaven</h3>

A man died and went to Heaven.  There were thousands of other people 
there.  They were all naked and all looked as they did at the age of 
21. He looked around to see if there was anyone he recognised.  He 
saw a couple and he knew immediately that they were Adam and Eve.  How 
did he know?

A silly one - but it is surprisingly popular.

<h3><li>Manhole Covers</h3>

Why is it better to have round manhole covers than square ones?

<p>
This is logical rather than lateral, but it is a good puzzle which can 
be solved by lateral thinking techniques.  It is supposedly used by a 
very well-known software company as an interview question for 
prospective employees.

Two men went into a restaurant.  They both ordered the same dish from 
the menu.  After they tasted it, one of the men went outside the 
restaurant and shot himself.  Why?

swimming trunks, snorkel and facemask.  The nearest lake was 8 miles 
away and the sea was 100 miles away.  How had he died?

<p>
This is supposedly based on a true incident.  Does this make it an 
urban legend?  Many urban legends can be restated as lateral thinking 
puzzles.  This is a very good one of this type.
