<h1>Solution to the /arithmetic/digits/nine.digits problem</h1>
<hr>
First, reduce the sample set. For each digit of ABCDEFGHI, such that the last
digit, (current digit), is the same as a multiple of N :

<pre>
A: Any number 1-9
B: Even numbers 2,4,6,8 (divisible by 2).
C: Any number 1-9 (21,12,3,24,15,6,27,18,9).
D: Even numbers 2,4,6,8 (divisible by 4, every other even).
E: 5 (divisible by 5 and 0 not allowed).
F: Even numbers (12,24,6,18)
G: Any number 1-9 (21,42,63,14,35,56,7,28,49).
H: Even numbers (32,24,16,8)
I: Any number 1-9 (81,72,63,54,45,36,27,18,9)
</pre>
Since E must be 5, I can eliminate it everywhere else.
Since I will use up all the even digits, (2,4,6,8) filling in those spots
   that must be even. Any number becomes all odds, except 5.
<pre>
A: 1,3,7,9
B: 2,4,6,8
C: 1,3,7,9
D: 2,4,6,8
E: 5
F: 2,4,6,8
G: 1,3,7,9
H: 2,4,6,8
I: 1,3,7,9

</pre>
We have that 2C+D=0 (mod 4), and since C is odd,
this implies that D is 2 or 6; similarly we find that H is 2 or 6 ==&gt;
{B,F} = {4,8}.  D+5+F=0 (mod 3) ==&gt; if D=2 then F=8, if D=6 then F=4.

<p>
We have two cases.

<p>
Assume our number is of the form A4C258G6I0.  Now the case n=8 ==&gt;
G=1,9; case n=3 ==&gt; A+1+C=0 (mod 3) ==&gt; {A,C}={1,7} ==&gt; G=9, I=3.
The two numbers remaining fail for n=7.

<p>
Assume our number is of the form A8C654G2I0.  The case n=8 ==&gt; G=3,7.
If G=3, we need to check to see which of 1896543, 9816543, 7896543, 
and 9876543 are divisible by 7; none are.

<p>
If G=7, we need to check to see which of 1896547, 9816547, 1836547,
and 3816547 are divisible by 7; only the last one is, which yields
the solution 3816547290.
