<h1>Solution to the /logic/ropes problem</h1>
<hr>
Almost all of it.  Tie the ropes together.  Climb up one of them.  Tie
a loop in it as close as possible to the ceiling.  Cut it below the
loop.  Run the rope through the loop and tie it to your waist.  Climb
the other rope (this may involve some swinging action).  Pull the rope
going through the loop tight and cut the other rope as close as
possible to the ceiling.  You will swing down on the rope through the
loop.  Lower yourself to the ground by letting out rope.  Pull the
rope through the loop.  You will have nearly all the rope.
