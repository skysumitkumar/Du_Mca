<h2>7-11</h2>
A customer at a 7-11 store selected four items to buy, and was told
that the cost was $7.11.  He was curious that the cost was the same
as the store name, so he inquired as to how the figure was derived.
The clerk said that he had simply multiplied the prices of the four
individual  items.  The customer  protested  that  the four  prices     
should have been ADDED,  not MULTIPLIED.  The  clerk said that that
was OK with him, but, the result was still the same: exactly $7.11.

<p>
What were the prices of the four items?

<h2>clock/day.of.week</h2>
It's restful sitting in Tom's cosy den, talking quietly and sipping
a glass of his Madeira.

<p>
I was there one Sunday and we had the usual business of his clock.
When the radio gave the time at the hour, the Ormolu antique was 
exactly 3 minutes slow.

<p>
"It loses 7 minutes every hour", my old friend told me, as he had done
so many times before.  "No more and no less, but I've gotten used to
it that way."

<p>
When I spent a second evening with him later that same month, I remarked
on the fact that the clock was dead right by radio time at the hour.
It was rather late in the evening, but Tom assured me that his treasure
had not been adjusted nor fixed since my last visit.
<p>
What day of the week was the second visit?
