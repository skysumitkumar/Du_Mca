shuffles a pack and gives five cards to A.  A lays 4 of 5 cards on the
table in a row, face up, and gives fifth card to spectator.  B returns
to the room, looks at the 4 cards and names the fifth card.

<h2>guessing.over.phone</h2>
<pre>You are at a party and announce that you have a friend who is such a
great psychic that he can tell what card someone picked out of a deck
via the telephone.

You then get a pack of cards and ask for the group to select someone to
pick a card from the deck.  At this point there are two variations: 1)
If you know how, you can force a card on the person or 2) you can
spread the cards face up and let the person pick one.  Then you go to
the telephone and call your psychic friend.  You say "Is (name) there?"
followed by "(name) this is (your name)" and finally "(name) will you
tell (selectee's name) what his/her card is?"

The friend then correctly identifies the card.
