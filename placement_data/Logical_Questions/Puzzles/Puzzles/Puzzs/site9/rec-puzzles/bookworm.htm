<h1>Solution to the /logic/bookworm problem</h1>
<hr>
On a book shelf the first page of the first volume is on the "inside"
<pre>
  __                             __
B|  |                           |  |F
A|1 |...........................|10|R
C|  |                           |  |O
K|  |                           |  |N
 |  |                           |  |T
  ----------------------------------
</pre>
so the bookworm eats only through the cover of the first volume, then 8 times
1000 pages of Volumes 2 - 9, then through the cover to the last page of Vol 10.
He eats 8,000 pages.

<p>
If the bookworm ate the first page and the last page, it ate 8,004 pages.
<p>
This assumes a sheet of paper counts as two pages. If you want to call that one page, he ate through 4,000 pages.
