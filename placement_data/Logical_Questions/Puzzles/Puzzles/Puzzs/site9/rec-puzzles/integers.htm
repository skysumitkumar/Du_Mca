<h1>Solution to the /logic/smullyan/integers problem</h1>
<hr>
If A saw 1, she would know that she had 2, and would say so.  Therefore,
A did not see 1.  A says "I don't know my number."

<p>
If B saw 2, she would know that she had 3, since she knows that A did not see
1, so B did not see 1 or 2.  B says "I don't know my number."

<p>
If A saw 3, she would know that she had 4, since she knows that B did not
see 1 or 2, so A did not see 1, 2 or 3.  A says "I don't know my number."

<p>
If B saw 4, she would know that she had 5, since she knows that A did not
see 1, 2 or 3, so B did not see 1, 2, 3 or 4.  B says "I don't know my number."
... n statements of ignorance later ...

<p>
If X saw n, she would know that she had n + 1, since she knows that ~X did not
see 1 ... n - 1, so X did see n.  X says "I know my number."

<p>
And the number in n + 1.
