1 for n=2
3 for n=3
2n-4 for n&gt;=4
</pre>

This can be achieved as follows: choose four people (A, B, C, and D) as
the "core group".  Each person outside the core group phones a member of
the core group (it doesn't matter which); this takes n-4 calls.  Now the
core group makes 4 calls: A-B, C-D, A-C, and B-D.  At this point, each
member of the core group knows everything.  Now, each person outside the
core group calls anybody who knows everything; this again requires n-4
calls, for a total of 2n-4.
