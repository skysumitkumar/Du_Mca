<h2>amoeba</h2>
A jar begins with one amoeba.  Every minute, every amoeba
turns into 0, 1, 2, or 3 amoebae with probability 25%
for each case ( dies, does nothing, splits into 2, or splits 
into 3).  What is the probability that the amoeba population
eventually dies out?

<h2>cab</h2>
A cab was involved in a hit and run accident at night.  Two cab companies,
the Green and the Blue, operate in the city.  Here is some data:

	a)  Although the two companies are equal in size, 85% of cab 
accidents in the city involve Green cabs and 15% involve Blue cabs.

	b)  A witness identified the cab in this particular accident as Blue.
The court tested the reliability of the witness under the same circumstances
that existed on the night of the accident and concluded that the witness 
correctly identified each one of the two colors 80% of the time and failed
20% of the time.

What is the probability that the cab involved in the accident was 
Blue rather than Green?

If it looks like an obvious problem in statistics, then consider the
following argument:

The probability that the color of the cab was Blue is 80%!  After all,
the witness is correct 80% of the time, and this time he said it was Blue!

What else need be considered?  Nothing, right?

If we look at Bayes theorem (pretty basic statistical theorem) we 
should get a much lower probability.  But why should we consider statistical
theorems when the problem appears so clear cut?  Should we just accept the 
80% figure as correct?

<h2>random.walk</h2>
Waldo has lost his car keys!  He's not using a very efficient search;
in fact, he's doing a random walk.  He starts at 0, and moves 1 unit
to the left or right, with equal probability.  On the next step, he
moves 2 units to the left or right, again with equal probability.  For
subsequent turns he follows the pattern 1, 2, 1, etc.

<h2>reactor</h2>
There is a reactor in which a reaction is to take place. This reaction
stops if an electron is present in the reactor. The reaction is started
with 18 positrons; the idea being that one of these positrons would
combine with any incoming electron (thus destroying both). Every second,
exactly one particle enters the reactor. The probablity that this particle   
is an electron is 0.49 and that it is a positron is 0.51.

<h2>roulette</h2>
You are in a game of Russian roulette, but this time the gun (a 6
shooter revolver) has three bullets _in_a_row_ in three of the
chambers.  The barrel is spun only once.  Each player then points the
gun at his (her) head and pulls the trigger.  If he (she) is still
alive, the gun is passed to the other player who then points it at his
(her) own head and pulls the trigger.  The game stops when one player
dies.
