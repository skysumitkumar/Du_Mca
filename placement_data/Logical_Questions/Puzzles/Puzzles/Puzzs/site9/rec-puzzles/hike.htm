<h1>Solution to the /geometry/hike problem</h1>
<hr>
Go 2/sqrt(3) away from the starting point, turn 120 degrees and head
1/sqrt(3) along a tangent to the unit circle, then traverse an arc of
length 7*pi/6 along this circle, then head off on a tangent 1 mile.

<p>
This gives a minimum of sqrt(3) + 7*pi/6 + 1 = 6.397...

<p>
It remains to prove this is the optimal answer.
