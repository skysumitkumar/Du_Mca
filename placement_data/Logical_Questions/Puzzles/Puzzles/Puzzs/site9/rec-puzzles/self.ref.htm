6210001000
<p>
For other numbers of digits:
<pre>
n=1:	no sequence possible
n=2:	no sequence possible
n=3:	no sequence possible
n=4:	1210, 2020
n=5:	21200
n=6:	no sequence possible
n=7:	3211000
n=8:	42101000
n=9:	521001000
n=10:	6210001000
n&gt;10:	(n-4), 2, 1, 0 * (n-7), 1, 0, 0, 0
</pre>
No 1, 2, or 3 digit numbers are possible.  Letting x_i be the ith
digit, starting with 0, we see that (1) x_0 + ... + x_n = n+1 and
(2) 0*x_0 + ... + n*x_n = n+1, where n+1 is the number of digits.

<p>
I'll first prove that x_0 &gt; n-3 if n&gt;4.  Assume not, then this
implies that at least four of the x_i with i&gt;0 are non-zero.  But
then we would have \sum_i i*x_i &gt;= 10 by (2), impossible unless n=9,
but it isn't possible in this case (51111100000 isn't valid).

<p>
Now I'll prove that x_0 &lt; n-1.  x_0 clearly can't equal n; assume
x_0 = n-1 ==&gt; x_{n-1} = 1 by (2) if n&gt;3.  Now only one of the
remaining x_i may be non-zero, and we must have that x_0 + ... + x_n
= n+1, but since x_0 + x_{n-1} = n ==&gt; the remaining x_i = 1 ==&gt; by
(2) that x_2 = 1.  But this can't be, since x_{n-1} = 1 ==&gt; x_1&gt;0.
Now assuming x_0 = n-2 we conclude that x_{n-2} = 1 by (2) if n&gt;5
==&gt; x_1 + ... + x_{n-3} + x_{n-1} + x_n = 2 and 1*x_1 + ... +
(n-3)*x_{n-3} + (n-1)*x_{n-1} + n*x_n = 3 ==&gt; x_1=1 and x_2=1,
contradiction.

<p>
<h3>Case n&gt;5:</h3>

We have that x_0 = n-3 and if n&gt;=7 ==&gt; x_{n-3}=1 ==&gt; x_1=2 and
x_2=1 by (1) and (2).  For the case n=6 we see that x_{n-3}=2
leads to an easy contradiction, and we get the same result.  The
cases n=4,5 are easy enough to handle, and lead to the two solutions
above.
