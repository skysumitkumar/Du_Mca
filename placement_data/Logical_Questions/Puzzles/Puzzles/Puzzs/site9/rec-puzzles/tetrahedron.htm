<h1>Solution to the /geometry/tetrahedron problem</h1>
<hr>
For each face of the tetrahedron, construct a new tetrahedron with that
face as the base and the center of the sphere as the fourth vertex.
Now the original tetrahedron is divided into four smaller ones, each of
height R.  The volume of a tetrahedron is Ah/3 where A is the area of
the base and h the height; in this case h=R.  Combine the four
tetrahedra algebraically to find that the volume of the original
tetrahedron is R/3 times its surface area.
