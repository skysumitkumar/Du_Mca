<h1>Solution to the /logic/centrifuge problem</h1>
<hr>
The superposition of any two solutions is yet another solution, so given
that the factors &gt; 1 of 12 (2, 3, 4, 6, 12) are all solutions, the
only thing to check about, for example, the proposed solution 2+3 is
that not all ways of combining 2 &amp; 3 would have centrifuge tubes
from one subsolution occupying the slot for one of the tubes in
another solution.  For the case 2+3, there is no problem:  Place 3
tubes, one in every 4th position, then place the 4th and 5th
diametrically opposed (each will end up in a slot adjacent to one of
the first 3 tubes).  The obvious generalization is, what are the
numbers of tubes that cannot be balanced?  Observing that there are
solutions for 2,3,4,5,6 tubes and that if X has a solution, 12-X has
also one (obtained by swapping tubes and holes), it is obvious that
1 and 11 are the only cases without solutions.

<p>
Here is how this problem is often solved in practice:  A dummy tube
is added to produce a total number of tubes that is easy to balance.
For example, if you had to centrifuge just one sample, you'd add a
second tube opposite it for balance.
