<h1>Solution to the /logic/flip problem</h1>
<hr>
A flips a coin.  If the result is heads, A multiplies 2 prime numbers
containing about 90 digits; if the result is tails, A multiplies 3
prime numbers containing about 60 digits.  A tells B the result of the
multiplication.  B now calls either heads or tails and tells A.  A then
supplies B with the original numbers to verify the flip.

<p>
Consider what is involved in multiplying 90 digit numbers.  Using the method
of long multiplication that we all learned in grade school, you have maybe
90 or so strings of 90 characters (or "digits") each.  That's no problem for
a computer to deal with.  The magnitude of the number represented isn't
much of a factor; we're only manipulating the string of digits.

<p>
Consider what is involved in factoring 90 digit numbers.  There are of course,
little tricks for determining factorability by small integers which we all
learned in grade school.  (Is the last digit even?  Is the sum of all the
digits divisible by 9?  And so on.)  But these are of little use in factoring
large numbers with large factors.  In fact, there is no essentially better
method than checking every number smaller that the number to be factored and
seeing if it one divides the other evenly.  We means we could be checking some
100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000
nummbers.  This is very hard to do, even for a supercomputer.  Here, the
number of digits this number has is of little consequence.  It is the
magnitude of the number that we have to worry about, and there just isn't 
enough time in the world to do this properly.

<p>
Where does A find a list of 60- and 90- digit prime numbers?  Well, that's not
to hard to come by.  The simplest method to find a few prime numbers is simply
to choose a 90-digit number (or 60-digit number, as the case warrants)
randomly, and check to see if it is prime.  You won't have to wait too long
before you stumble across a prime number.

<p>
"But wait!" you cry.  "I thought you just said it was incredibly difficult
to factor large numbers.  If that's the case, then how are you going to know
if the number you randomly choose is prime?"  A good question.  Here we enter
into the strange an wacky world of number theory.  It turns out (and I won't
explain how unless someone asks) there are "probabalistic" algorithms,
which depend on us choosing numbers at random.  There are probablistic
algorithms that when given a prime number, will quickly tell us that it is
a prime number, and when given a composite number, will either tell us that
it is a composite number (with very, very high probability) or will tell us
that it is a prime number (with very, very low probability.)  What's the use
of an algorithm that only returns the right answer "with very, very high
probability?"  Well, we can make this probability as high as we want, just by
running the algorithm longer.  In fact, it is within our technological
abilities to quickly run this algorithm for 90-digit numbers so that the
probability of it giving a wrong answer is less than the probability of a
cosmic ray striking a vital part of the computer at some vital time and causing
the computer to spit out the wrong answer anyway.  That's what I mean by "very,
very high."
