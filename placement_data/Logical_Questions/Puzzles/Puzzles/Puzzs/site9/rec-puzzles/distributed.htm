<h1>Solution to the /analysis/functional/distributed problem</h1>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>  Assuming f finite everywhere, (*) ==&gt; x&lt;&gt;y ==&gt; f(x)&lt;&gt;f(y)

<li>  Exchanging x and y in (*) we see that f(-x) = -f(x).

<li>  a &lt;&gt; 0 ==&gt; f((a-a)/(a+a)) = (f(a)-f(a))/(f(a)+f(a)) ==&gt; f(0) = 0.

<li>  a &lt;&gt; 0 ==&gt; f((a+0)/(a-0)) = f(a)/f(a) ==&gt; f(1) = 1.

<li>  x&lt;&gt;y, y&lt;&gt;0 ==&gt; f(x/y) =
f( ((x+y)/(x-y) + (x-y)/(x-y)) / ((x+y)/(x-y) - (x-y)/(x-y)) = f(x)/f(y)
==&gt; f(xy) = f(x)f(y) by replacing x with xy and by noting that
f(x*1) = f(x)*1 and f(x*0) = f(x)*f(0).

<li>  f(x*x) = f(x)*f(x) ==&gt; f(x) &gt; 0 if x&gt;0.

<li>  Let a=1+\/2, b=1-\/2; a,b satisfy (x+1)/(x-1) = x ==&gt;
f(x) = (f(x)+1)/(f(x)-1) ==&gt; f(a)=a, f(b)=b.  f(1/\/2) = f((a+b)/(a-b))
= (a+b)/(a-b) = 1/\/2 ==&gt; f(2) = 2.

<li>  By induction and the relation f((n+1)/(n-1)) = (f(n)+1)/(f(n)-1)
we get that f(n)=n for all integer n.  #5 now implies that f fixes
the rationals.

<li>  If x&gt;y&gt;0 (*) ==&gt; f(x) - f(y) = f(x+y)/f((x+y)/(x-y)) &gt; 0 by #6.
</ol>
Thus f is order-preserving.

<p>
Since f fixes the rationals *and* f is order-preserving, f must be the
identity function.

This was E2176 in _The American Mathematical Monthly_ (the proposer was
R. S. Luthar).
