<br>

<h2>How does our memory work?</h2>

We remember things by association. Every piece of information in our memory is connected to other pieces in some way or another. For example, if you are given the word "apple", what do you think of? Perhaps something like this: <br><br>

APPLE: red, round, sweet, teacher, tree, fruit <br>But it's unlikely that we might see "apple" and think of "dog" (unless you remember some funny incident in which your dog investigated an apple). And what if you were asked what the 7th letter of the alphabet was? Chances are, you wouldn't know that "G = 7," but you could easily think to yourself, "A B C D E F G," and then say "G". You used association to get to the letter G, because you knew A was the first letter, then you kept choosing the next letter in the sequence until you got to the right one. <br><br>


<h2>Why do most of us have a bad memory?</h2>


Most of us don't. Most of us have a really good memory, but we just don't have practice 
in using it efficiently. <br><br>

If the above is true, then why is it so hard for me to remember things?<br>

As stated before, our memory works by association. If there is no obvious association between things, it's very difficult to remember them. For example, suppose you needed to remember that your plane takes off at 2 P.M. There is nothing about the plane that would suggest the number 2 more than it would any other number (at least at first glance). Therefore, 2 is easily forgotten. Likewise, how does your best friend relate to his phone number, an arbitrary string of digits? Or how does a new word, like "hypothalamus," relate to what it represents? <br><br>



<h2>How can we learn to remember things better?</h2>

Simple. If memory works by association, we actively work to create an association between two bits of information. For example, for the plane that we need to catch at 2 P.M., we can imagine the plane in our mind, and notice that it has 2 wings. Two wings, 2 P.M. There's an association. We are now ten times more likely to remember the take-off time long after it has faded from our short-term memory. <br><br>

Sometimes an association comes very easily. For example, suppose you are introduced to a Mr. Hill who lives on a hill at the end of town. Mr. Hill on a hill. Pretty easy, huh? Or what if you're trying to remember the classroom number for a Chemistry class, and it just so turns out that it's the same as your dorm room number. Another natural association! Do you think you'll have a problem remembering it? <br><br>

When pieces of information are not obviously related in any way, however, we have to be a bit more creative in linking things together. But it isn't as hard as it seems. Most of us learned rhymes and acronyms in school that helped us remember things. Do any of the following look familiar to you? <br><br>


i before e except after c, or when sounded like a as in neighbor and weigh (rule for remembering ei or ie)<br>
ROY G. BIV (colors of the rainbow) <br>
All cows eat grass; Every good boy does fine (notes of musical scale) 
Never eat sour watermelons (directions on a compass) 
Why do they work? Because they form an easy-to-remember and clever association between themselves and the information that is to be remembered. <br><br>

The idea is to be creative and clever. You don't have to invent a rhyme or a poem every time you want to remember something, though -- just think of a picture in your mind that links pieces of information together, preferably something unusual or silly so it is more memorable. For example, suppose you want to remember that the football field is on Maple Street. You might imagine in your mind a burly football player eating a football for breakfast... he pours some maple syrup on the football, cuts off a chunk and eats it! <br><br>

To demonstrate how effectively this works, look at the following list of words, and try to come up with an association between the left word and the right word of each row. Some will be easy; others may be harder. As an example, for the first pair, you might want to imagine a mouse that has a long, wavy tail that is in the shape of the letter S. <br><br>
<pre>

                 mouse                   S
                 fur                     R
                 train                   bridge
                 moat                    boat
                 popcorn                 chair
                 elephant                pancake
                 toothbrush              canal
                 umbrella                triangle
</pre>

After you have formed the associations (if you had trouble on one or two of them, that's okay; just skip them for now), cover up the right side of the list and then try to name the word associated with each word on the left. If you formed vivid, clear associations, you may be surprised at how quickly and easily you were able to remember everything!<br><br>

At this point, you may be somewhat skeptical at this new memorization scheme that I am proposing to you. You may be asking, "Are you telling me that every time I need to memorize something important, I'm supposed to invent some clever or silly association between pieces of information?" The answer is, yes! It is a time-proven method that works, and it is consistent with what psychologists have discovered about the human memory. We know that memory works best by association, and we are simply taking advantage of that property to help us remember things more easily. 
Here are some other properties of memory: 


<h2>Law of Recency: </h2>

We are more likely to remember things that happened recently than those that happened a long time ago. You can probably remember what you had for dinner yesterday, but not what you ate for dinner two weeks ago today. <br><br>

<h2>Law of Vividness: </h2>

We tend to remember the most spectacular or striking impressions rather than those that are more ordinary. You can probably remember what you did on your last birthday, or perhaps the Space Shuttle Challenger explosion, but not what happened on the previous day of those occasions (unless, that too, was a "special" occasion). <br><br>

<h2>Law of Frequency: </h2>

We tend to remember things we experience the most often, rather than those we experience only once in a while. You are much more likely to remember your name or your phone number than the square root of 3 (unless you are a mathematician). 
We can take advantage of these laws, too. For example, we all know that if we repeat a word or phrase 20 times, we can remember it more easily. <br><br>

What about the "Law of vividness?" Well, suppose we wanted to memorize the pair of words "trowel" and "cake". We might think of our using a trowel to pick up part of a cake-like chunk of cement. Or what about this: a little girl walks up to a table which you are seated at, carrying a trowel. Smiling, she lifts it up and shoves it right into your beautiful birthday cake! Which of these two associations is easier to remember? Surely, the second one, because it's much more vivid. This is why, when we try to invent associations, the rule is: "the sillier, the better!" <br><br>


<h2>What if I memorize too many "bits and pieces of useless information"?</h2>

As far as psychologists can tell, the human brain has a limitless capacity for holding information. This means that our brains will never "fill up." New information may, however, interfere with information learned in the past, making the older information more difficult to remember. To avoid this problem, a little "management" may be required.<br><br>

For temporary things, such as memorizing the time of a doctor's appointment or the name of some person you are going to call once (but not ever again), do nothing. Because we no longer need this information, eventually we will forget it.<br><br> 

For more permanent things, such as memorizing trivia facts, phone numbers, license plates, etc., deliberately go back over all the things you've learned on a particular day and think of the pictures you came up with again. Do this every few hours or so. Then recall the new information once a day for a few days. By the end of a week, the things you have memorized will have become almost permanently fixed. <br><br>

What about all of the silly pictures? Will our minds be cluttered up with all of them? Probably not. If we recall a piece of information often enough, eventually we will no longer need the picture to remember it. Going back to the football field example, if you keep having to recall that it is on Maple Street, eventually you will think "Football field = Maple Street" without even thinking of the football player's strange breakfast. And if you no longer have to remember that picture, it will become forgotten... and perhaps even "recycled" and used again in a future association. <br><br>


<h2>What if I can't think of an association?</h2>

All of the examples given thus far have had easy associations -- the association was either very obvious, or there were two words that could be pictured very easily together in the mind. But what about words that can't be pictured so easily? Don't panic, there are other techniques that can be used.<br><br>
 
Suppose you want to memorize that James Barstow lives on Lincoln Street. Instinct should tell you to somehow link "Barstow" with "Lincoln," but neither word forms a nice mental picture. So let's make one by finding words that either sound like or are directly related to the real words we want to use. For "Barstow," you could choose "bar stove." For "Lincoln," you might think of a penny, for President Lincoln's picture is on a penny. You could then picture Mr. Barstow, serving drinks at a bar (never mind that he isn't really a bartender). He goes over to this funny-looking stove, which is made entirely out of copper. Four electric burners are on this stove, each looking just like a giant penny. He looks down at the burners, and President Lincoln winks at him! 
<br><br>

How about applying this same technique to learn new vocabulary words? I remember having to learn about various parts of the brain in Psychology class, and I used memory techniques to quickly memorize all the new words. One of the parts was the "parietal lobe," the part of the cerebral cortex which interprets touch. I thought of a parrot (sounds sort of like "parietal") pecking at some food in my hand, and the brain feeling some sharp pain! Another part was the "temporal lobe," which interprets hearing. I thought of myself listening to a happy song with an up-beat tempo. <br><br>

We live in a society filled with numbers: social security numbers, dates, license plate numbers, prices, zip codes, etc. Yet without a special technique, numbers are very difficult to memorize because they are so hard to associate. Our brains think with pictures, not with numbers. It's easier for us to visualize an elephant eating a ham sandwich than to picture the string of numbers $2,347.91. But what if we could mentally convert a number into a word, a word that represents a mental picture? It turns out that we can. <br><br>

Suppose we assigned each of the digits 0 through 9 to a consonant. Then, when we want to remember a number, we convert the number into consonants, insert vowels, and form a word. This word can then be used to form an association much more readily, rather than trying to use the number itself. <br><br>

As an example, suppose we want to remember that the Old Testament has 39 books, and suppose 3 and 9 translated into M and P, respectively. We could then insert the vowel A between the consonants to come up with the word "map". We would then visualize a huge map in front of us, with the Mediterranean Sea, Israel, Egypt, Mt. Sinai, etc.: a nice map of the Old Testament. Two weeks later we want to remember how many books were in the Old Testament. We recall that huge map with all the places on it. MAP... consonants are M and P... that's 3 and 9. 39! We did it! That's sort of a roundabout way of doing it, but it works, because of the associations.<br><br> 

So, you ask, how do I know that M is 3 and P is 9? The answer is that you must first memorize the following table of consonants and digits. Oh dear, you say. But wait... once this chart is memorized, it can be used for life! And second, there's even a scheme to associate the numbers with the letters! <br><br>

<pre>

                 NUMBER   LETTER/SOUND   MEMORY AID
                 1        t, d           t has one downstroke
                 2        n              n has two downstrokes
                 3        m              m has three downstrokes
                 4        r              "four" ends with R
                 5        l              Latin 50 = L
                 6        j, sh, ch      J reversed looks like 6
                 7        k, g (hard)    Visualize a K drawn with two 7s
                 8        f, v           Cursive f has two loops like an 8
                 9        p, b           P reversed looks like 9
                 0        z, s           "zero" starts with Z
</pre>

This is the standardized mnemonic system used by memory experts. It has been optimized in order to make it easy to learn and use. Note that pairs of letters have been grouped together because of their phonetic similarity, such as t and d or p and b. If you are not familiar with phonetics, whisper the word "dog." Notice that it sounds like "tok". This is how you can tell which sounds are phonetically similar.<br><br>
 
Here are some rules about using the number alphabet: <br>


The alphabet is strictly phonetic. For example, the word "cough" should be thought of as KoF and translated into 78; "gem" is pronounced JeM and is thus 63. 
Double letters are not counted. For example, "Butter" translates into B, T and R (only one T).<br><br>

Three consonant sounds do not appear in the chart: W, H and Y. Why, you ask? Good question! Good answer! <br><br>

Vowels are always ignored, as well as W, H and Y mentioned above. The long word "hollow," for example, contains just one useful letter: L. <br><br>

When creating words from consonants, vivid nouns usually work the best, rather than adjectives, verbs or other related words. <br>
Before reading further, take a few minutes to memorize the number alphabet. Thanks to the memory aids, it shouldn't take long. Cover all but the "number" column and try to name the letter or letters. Then write the groups of letters in random order on a piece of paper, look at the letter groups, and try to come up with the number. <br><br>

You are now ready to memorize most any kind of number! Suppose you need to remember that a bowling tournament is being held on the 25th of this month. 25 translates into NL which might stand for "nail." Now picture yourself bowling, but when the ball hits the pins, the ball surprisingly bounces back! That's because someone nailed the pins to the floor. Bowling, nail, NL, 25, 25th. It works! <br><br>

What about the periodic number for Potassium (19)? Perhaps you will think of bananas, which have lots of potassium, sitting on a table. Table = TBL = 195. But note that the number for potassium only has two digits, so we can throw out the extra 5. We get 19! How about silver (47)? Perhaps a RAKE made of pure silver? How about gold (79)? Perhaps you might think of a mysterious person in town who has gold in his cupboard? Pronounce it "kubbard," throw out the extra numbers, and you get KB = 79. <br><br>

What about much longer numbers, like an employee ID number of 857502? It would be almost impossible for you to come up with a word that fits "FLKLSN," and it would also be hard to come up with a series of words that don't have any extra, unwanted letters in them. Let's break it down into three parts: 85-75-02. Now, let's come up with a word for each part. Perhaps file, coal and sniff. Sniff represents 028, but since we are memorizing only pairs, any extra numbers are ignored. Imagine you come into your office, and go to your FILE cabinet. Opening it, you see that someone has dumped coal into it! And then when you sniff the drawer, it smells awful! The next time you fill out some form at the office, all you have to do is remember that story, and then write down 857502 instinctively.<br><br>

<h2>Memorizing Short Lists</h2>
<font color="black">
Suppose you're going to the store for groceries and you need the following five items: eggs, bread, bacon, cheese and milk. How can you remember the list? For short lists, the easiest way is simply to "link" the words together in a long chain, like this:<br><br> 
   eggs -> bread -> bacon -> cheese -> milk<br>

Then, think of some animated story in your mind to link the items together. For example, imagine walking to the store with a grocery bag in your hand. We start with a grocery bag because it's a grocery list -- it would be difficult to jump immediately to eggs. On a street corner someone appears from nowhere, hands you an egg then walks off. Dazed, you take the egg and drop it in the bag. It cracks and makes a mess. (The mess is a vivid picture in your mind that strengthens the picture of "egg" even more.) So by the time the next person comes out of nowhere and hands you a loaf of bread, you don't want to put it in the bag, so you carry it in your other hand. You hold it by the tie and it twirls as you walk.<br><br>

This is a long story so far, but remember, you're not writing a story on paper, you're just thinking of it in your mind, so it goes rather quickly. In fact it often goes so quickly through your mind that the added, extra detail is very helpful in remembering later. The more ways you experience an object -- if you think of its appearance, its touch, its smell, etc. -- the more likely you'll remember it later!<br><br>

Suddenly, there's bacon on the sidewalk as you're walking, and it crunches under your feet. The grease gets on your shoes. Next there's cheese on the ground, and you walk on it. Yuck! Now there's grease and gooey cheese on your shoes. When you get to the store, there's no restroom or water fountain, so you, strangely, just take a gallon of milk, open it, and pour it on your shoes to clean them! (Don't worry, this is only imagination -- you would never do this in real life!)<br><br>

Wow, what an exciting finish to the story. Notice that we didn't just put all the grocery items in the bag one by one. The instances would be so similar we'd get them mixed up! So a lot of variety was used. The story was so fun that, no doubt, you can stop right now, look away from this document, think through the story again and remember perfectly the five items. Try it again tomorrow morning and see if you still remember!<br><br>

<h2>Memorizing Long Lists</h2>

The grocery list was easy, but what about longer lists, such as a list of all of the states of the United States? If you forget a word in a middle, the chain is broken and you've lost the rest! Also, if you want to remember the 15th state -- useful if you memorized the states in order of population or size -- you have to recall the first fourteen. Another way to memorize lists is to use what are called"peg words."
Before we begin, memorize this short list of peg words. Note that they are numbered, and the peg word actually does translates into the correct number, so you should be able to form some associations right away.<br><br>
<pre> 

                 1. Hat
                 2. Hen
                 3. Ham
                 4. Rye
                 5. Hill
</pre>

Practice recalling the peg words before continuing.<br>
Now, let's use the peg words to memorize a list of the five biggest cities in Michigan, in order: Detroit, Grand Rapids, Warren, Flint and Lansing. We'll take each of the peg words and place them next to each item in the cities list. Next, we'll form some simple paired associations between the words. Note that instead of making a huge chain, we are now working with only pairs. <br><br>

<pre>

      PEG    ITEM           ASSOCIATION

   1. Hat    Detroit        Picture large top-hat with Model T cars
                            stiched on it in an interesting pattern
   2. Hen    Grand Rapids   Hen steps into a river, then is quickly
                            carried away and gushes through rapids
   3. Ham    Warren         Ham on platter is given to Warren Beatty
                            (movie star), who looks at it oddly
   4. Rye    Flint          Start with rye bread. Use Flint and
                            steel to make spark to burn the bread!
   5. Hill   Lansing        The hills are alive with the Sound of Music
                            (movie)! The whole land begins to sing!!
</pre>

After studying the above associations, cover it up, then look at the five peg items by themselves. Can you name all five cities on the list? Hopefully, you can. Note that we've solved our problem. Our long chain of items has been changed to a numerical chain, an easy list of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. These correspond to a certain peg item, which, after a little practice, you can easily name. Finally, we associate simple pairs of words: the peg words with the actual list of items. You probably could have done it easily by using the short list method -- I didn't want to give you a huge example so fast -- but it's obvious that this method would be very helpful for long lists (like the 50 states).<br><br>

To memorize longer lists, all you need to do is memorize a basic set of peg words, words which are derived from their associated numbers directly. Some example words are given below; you can also come up with your own. Try to come up with the shortest possible words for your list, because many different words can stand for a number, and you want to reduce the number of possibilities. (When memorizing numbers that aren't peg words, you can use longer words, because in that case, you will only be converting words to numbers, and a word always produces a unique number.)<br><br>

<pre> 

    1. Hat   11. Dot     21. Net    31. Mat    41. Road
    2. Hen   12. Town    22. Nun    32. Moon   42. Rain
    3. Ham   13. Dime    23. Name   33. Mummy  43. Room
    4. Rye   14. Tire    24. Nero   34. Mower  44. Aurora
    5. Hill  15. Doll    25. Nail   35. Mule   45. Roll
    6. Shoe  16. Tissue  26. Notch  36. Match  46. Rash
    7. Cow   17. Duck    27. Neck   37. Mug    47. Rock
    8. Ivy   18. Taffy   28. Knife  38. Movie  48. Roof
    9. Bee   19. Tape    29. Knob   39. Map    49. Rope
   10. Toes  20. Nose    30. Mouse  40. Rose   50. Lace
</pre>

The peg words method for lists is great for lists of items that must be in a specific order, because peg words are tied to specific numbers. Assuming you've previously memorized the five peg words, note how easily you can come up with the 4th item -- just go 4... rye... Flint -- without having to go through items 1 through 3 first. For unordered lists, where the assigned number is not important, you could even exchange items in the list to come up with easier associations.<br><br>

<h2>Where to Go From Here</h2>
<font color="black">
At this point, you've learned a bunch of techniques for memorizing things more effectively: forming pictures and making associations, making vivid or funny pictures, converting numbers to picture words, "linking" items in a long chain to form a list, and pairing items with peg words to memorize numbered lists. These are the basic techniques. If you read a book or different web site on memory improvement, you may find different terminology or a different presentation, but the basic ideas are the same.<br><br>

By now, you actually know most of what you need to know! Probably, though, you have a specific memory application in mind that wasn't covered here, such as memorizing mathematical formulas for school. To help with this, I've provided the "Tips & Tricks" section of this web site. Each section focuses on a specific application. There is no magic "right" or "wrong" way to memorize something; the idea is simply to take the information and techniques you've already learned and adapt them to the specific problem.<br><br>

What you have already learned you can apply to your life right away to help you remember things better, but if you are really serious about improving your memory a lot, then I suggest studying more about memory. In addition to the two other tutorials on this web site which cover more advanced memorization techniques, I encourage you to find a book on memory or perhaps simply check out a couple of other web sites. You can find some resources on the "Enhance" page.<br><br>

<h2>Practice Makes Perfect!</h2>

But above everything else, I encourage you to practice memorizing things every day. As a metaphor, consider this: If someone teaches you how to drive an automobile, and you study the car's Owner's Manual carefully, and learn perfectly everything there is to know about driving a car, that doesn't mean you can jump in a car and start driving flawlessly in downtown New York City! You know what you need to do, but it's awkward at first because you've had no practice.<br><br>

In the same way, you ought to keep practicing the memory techniques you've learned. Right now it still may be taking you some time to think of picture words for things, and you haven't learned yet what pictures work better for you than others. Look around your world and find things to memorize, such as your cousin's telephone number, your favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe, the call letters of your local TV stations, the vocabulary words in your school science textbook, the few phrases of French you've always wanted to memorize, your license plate or driver's license, etc.! Go for it! If you have trouble, don't give up. Say to yourself, "If I keep at it, I know there's a way to memorize this, and I'm not going to give up. I will work at it until I succeed!"
<br><br>

To end this tutorial, I would like to give you some more encouragement and motivation to practice. Someone from South Africa was boldly going forth to use the memorizing numbers technique to memorize telephone numbers, and he wrote to me with some questions. I noticed he wasn't doing it perfectly. But who cares! That's how you learn! I was impressed just by his motivation to even try to dive into a memory problem like this. The text prefixed with ">" is what was written to me; the other text is what I wrote in response. (Note: The telephone number given in the person's example and the corresonding picture story has been altered slightly to protect the person whose phone number it is; the new number represents no one in particular.)<br><br>
 
<pre>
>Will things like this make more sense to me in the future?  Can I
>safely assume that after using this technique for a while it will
>become easier and easier?
</pre>

Yes, with practice, you'll be able to do it more quickly, and you'll make fewer mistakes, and you'll have and idea as to what works and what doesn't. <br><br>

<pre>
>Here in South Africa we have cellphone numbers which go something
>like this - 082 746 4071.  Taking this example I have broken it up
>into pairs with accompanying letters :
>
>     08 - SF     Sniff
>     27 - NK     Nike
>     46 - RJ     Rich
>     40 - RZ     Rizlas
>     71 - CD     Card
</pre>

You'll want to use different words for the first and the last numbers. The word "Sniff" actually forms SNF which is 028. Likewise, card is 741. You could use "Sofa" or "Safe" for 08, and "Cat" or "Cod" for 71. "Rizlas" is okay for 40... it actually is 4050, but if you always memorize everything in pairs, you'll know it's only two digits, so you'll drop the extra digits.<br><br>

<pre> 
>Is the following a good example of remembering the number?
>"My friend walks into a shop and can Sniff the smell of new Nikes.
>Seeing as she is not Rich and only has Rizlas she decides to use a
>credit Card to buy a pair." -- This seems a bit confusing.
</pre>


Well, that's pretty good for a first try! If it were me, I'd want to emphasize what the key words are so I can be sure to pick them out... otherwise I might try to turn words like "Shop" into numbers. Of course, much is lost when you try to write down your memory picture in words. Actually, you'll be thinking pictures in your head and will be seeing a kind of movie. Also, if you use mostly nouns for your picture words and not adjectives or verbs, it's easier to form your movie. Usually I use adjectives and use verbs not as part of the picture but only to help link things together. This is something that I got only with quite a bit of practice.<br><br>

So, as an example, I'll do 08-27-46-40-71. Note that I'm using the words and pictures that work best for me; Your own personal experience will be different so different words/pictures will work better for you (by the way, isn't that neat? You'll come up with some picture movie unique to you that only you can appreciate in a very deep way because it reflects your own personal experience/likes/dislikes/ideas/etc!).<br><br>

Sofa, Nike, rash, rose, cut. I picture the friend (whose phone number it is -- important, since I need to link this person in with the story) entering his house. She opens the door and is surprised to find the house empty except for a single SOFA in the middle of the room. Then, she notices a very strong, terrible smell! She goes to the sofa, lifts one of the cushions, and finds a stinking pair of NIKES underneath (by the way, you might love Nikes as your favorite brand, but if you picture Nikes in this way it will be such a vivid picture in your head you'll never forget it!!). She drops the cushion down, but then she looks at her hand and sees a large RASH because apparently she accidentally touched one of the Nikes and got infected somehow. She goes to the bathroom to try to wash her hands, but instead of a bar of soap she finds a ROSE flower. She tries to wash her hands with the rose under the faucet, but it doesn't seem to work. In fact, in the attempt she scratches her arm with the stem of the rose and gets a CUT. (As if the rash on her hand wasn't bad enough!)<br><br>

That's a long story, but remember, a picture is 1,000 words, and I'm trying to picture this in my mind. In reality I wouldn't need to write down this story or even tell anyone about it (especially not the friend!!). There's a definite sequence of events so it's pretty clear what the order is of the five items. Also, there are ordinary elements to the story (the house, the sink, the faucet, etc.) and then there's some very unusual elements. Each of my five items is not a normal element but an unusual and even surprising element. So I can quickly think back through the script of events in my mind: SOFA viewing, NIKE discovery, RASH acquisition, ROSE wash-off-the-rash attempt, CUT wash-off-the-rash result. A silly story, but memorable!! <br><br>

<pre>
>Can a person ever get to a point where such 'story telling' is no
>longer needed and when I hear a number I will be able to commit
>it to memory immediately without having to go the picture route?
</pre>

Not quite. Yes, you will still need stories for brand new phone numbers, though you might get faster with practice. BUT... if you keep recalling someone's phone number over and over again, eventually you're going to think of the number directly without having to use the picture movie. After this happens, you won't need the picture movie, and the movie will gradually fade away (but not the number). <br><br>

<pre>
>Then again I suppose it's better to take a few minutes to recall
>a number (in this case) instead of not being able to recall it at all.
</pre>

Yes, you are right! <br>

<pre>
>Also, seeing as I am trying to remember someone else's phone
>number should I include that person in the image that I create
>with the number?  I suppose there should be some link between
>the two.
</pre>

Yes!<br>
One more thing: Most likely South Africa has "area codes" similar to the United States. In other words, if you are memorizing the phone numbers for 10 different friends, they're probably all going to start with "082". In that case, you can just skip the "082" and memorize only the unique numbers. You'll be able to guess "082" because probably "082" refers to some geographical region, and you know your friend lives in that region, so you can omit it from the story. You don't have to, of course, but if you do, you'll have a shorter story that will be faster to memorize.<br><br>

You certainly seem to be on the right track! Don't give up, and keep practicing, and I'm confident you'll do well and perhaps even surprise yourself!<br><br>

Sincerely,<br>

Kevin Jay North<br>
