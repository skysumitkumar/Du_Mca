mosquito in the room.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--<b>Anita Koddick</b><br>

<li>The world always makes the assumption that the exposure of an error is identical with the discovery of truth--that the error and truth are simply opposite.  They are nothing of the sort.

<li>Poetry is the art of creating imaginary gardens with real toads.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--<b>Marianne Moore</b><br>

<li>Literature and butterflies are the two sweetest passions known to man.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--<b>Vladimir Nabokov</b><br>

The others write the poetry that they dare not realize.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--<b>Oscar Wilde</b><br>
