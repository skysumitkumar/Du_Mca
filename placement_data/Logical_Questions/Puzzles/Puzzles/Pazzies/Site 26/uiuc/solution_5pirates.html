<font color="blue">Question:</font><br>
<P>There are 5 pirates numbered 1 through 5. They have to divide 1,000 gold 
coins amongst themselves. Any proposal on how to divide the coins has to be 
passed by a majority, otherwise the pirate proposing it is thrown overboard. All 
the pirates are assumed to be <I>greedy</I> and <I>intelligent </I>. They have 
to make their proposals in the order 5,4,3,2,1. What should pirate #5 propose? 
Explain your answer. 

<p>
<font color="blue">Answer:</font><br>
Pirate #5 should propose the following distribution for (5,4,3,2,1):<br>
997,0,1,0,2
<p>
<pre>
Let us look at this problem in reverse order:

1. If there is only one pirate left, then he gets all the gold.

2. If there are two pirates left, then pirate 4 has to offer all the gold
to pirate 5 - because otherwise pirate 5 would simply refuse the offer,
and get all the gold anyway.

Therefore, in this case:  Pirate 5    Pirate 4
                           1000          0

and the offer would be passed.

3. If there are three pirates left, pirate 3 would make the following
proposal:

Pirate 5    Pirate 4    Pirate 3
   0           1          999

Pirate 5 is going to veto this but pirate 4 would have to agree because
otherwise he is going to get 0 gold pieces. So the offer would be passed
by pirates 4 and 3.

4. If there are four pirate left, pirate 2 would make the following
proposal:

Pirate 5   Pirate 4   Pirate 3   Pirate 2
   1          2          0         997

Pirates 4 and 5 would agree because otherwise they would get less gold.
Pirate 3 would disagree, but the proposal would be passed by pirates 5, 4
and 2.

5. If there are 5 pirates left, pirate 1 would make the following
proposal:

Pirate 5   Pirate 4  Pirate 3  Pirate 2  Pirate 1
   2          0         1          0       997

Pirates 5 and 3 would agree, and pirates 2 and 4 would disagree, so the
proposal would be passed by pirates 5, 3 and 1.

In Darren's words: Arr maties, I know it doesnt seem fair, but thats the
way it works!
