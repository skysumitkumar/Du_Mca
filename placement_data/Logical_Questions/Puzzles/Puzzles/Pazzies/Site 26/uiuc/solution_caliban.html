<font color="blue">Question:</font><br>
When Caliban's will was opened it was found to contain the following
clause:
<p>

"I leave ten of my books to each of Low, Y.Y., and 'Critic,' who are
to choose in a certain order.
<p>

No person who has seen me in a green tie is to choose before Low.
<p>

If Y.Y. was not in Oxford in 1920 the first chooser never lent me
an umbrella.
<p>

If Y.Y. or 'Critic' has second choice, 'Critic' comes before the one
who first fell in love."
<p>

Unfortunately Low, Y.Y., and 'Critic' could not remember any of the
relevant facts; but the family solicitor pointed out that, assuming the
problem to be properly constructed (i.e. assuming it to contain no
statement superfluous to its solution) the relevant data and order
could be inferred.
<p>

What was the prescribed order of choosing; and who lent Caliban an
umbrella? You must explain your answer!!

Thanks to <font color="blue">Hjallti</font> for this explanation:
<pre>
 A conditional sentence is superfluous if the first part is wrong, so the first part is
always true. Therefor Low isn't second, (one of the others has to be). He is also not
third since the first sentence becomes superfluous (it never implies that someone should
choose BEFORE Low, it would contain no information if nobody has seen him in a green tie,
and that is the only possibility to put Low in the back). 
The last sentence also implies that Critic is not the last since the 'if' is true, and so
is the second part of the statement.

This leaves Low, Critic, Y.Y. as the right order.

Assuming that both Critic and Y.Y. did see the green tie, means that L has to be the
first. So only two orderings would survive the first condition, leaving two conditions to
loose one ordering, and making one condition superfluous so only one, either Critic or
Y.Y.,  did see the green tie.

Assuming that Critic did see the green tie, this leaves room to YLC,LYC and LCY, from the
last statement LYC drops (we know Y.Y. fell in love first, since we already know the
solution). The second condition using to choose YLC and LCY, and thus leaving Y.Y. with
the umbrella. 

On the other hand assuming that Y.Y. did see the green tie, it leaves us with LCY,LYC,CLY,
again LYC drops from the last statement, leaving the middle statement to choose from LCY
and CLY. Therefor Critic has to be the one lenting an umbrella.

 I think that this shows that we can't find out the umbrella lenter
