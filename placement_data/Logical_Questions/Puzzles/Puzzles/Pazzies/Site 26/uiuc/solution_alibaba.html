<font color="blue">Question:</font><br>
This is one of Raymond Smullyan's cooler logic puzzles.

                      Twenty of Ali Baba's thieves once captured an enormous plunder consisting of diamonds, emeralds,
                      rubies, gold coins, chocolate and other goodies. Then came the question of dividing the loot so that
                      each of the twenty believed he had his fair share. Now, some prefer jewels, some prefer chocolate
                      and so on. In other words, different members will have different ideas as to what constitutes one
                      twentieth of the loot. So it won't work for one person to simply divide the loot into what he considers
                      twenty equal parts and pass the parts around; many would be dissatisfied. However, it is possible to
                      make a division such that each person feels satisfied that he has got at least one twentieth of the loot.
                      Of course there is nothing special about the number twenty; the same could be done with a hundred
                      people, or any number of people. For example, the way to do it with only two people is as follows :
                      One person divides the material into what he considers two equal parts and lets the other person
                      choose which part he wants. Then both are bound to be satisfied. The question is how do you adapt
                      this to twenty people?

<font color="blue">Answer:</font><br>
Thanks to John Tripp for this explanation: <p>
Thieves decide upon a rotation based on lots, or something else.  It
doesn't really matter.
<p>

1st thief seperates what he believes is 1/20 th of the treasure.
<p>

He now offers it to each of the others.  If they agree that it represents
1/20th or less, they will allow the 1st person to keep it.  If not, they
take the loot.
<p>

So, if all 19 agree then the first pirate has his portion, and is no longer
involved.
<p>

If someone disagrees, he takes the portion over from the first thief, and,
returns something from the seperated pile to the treasure pile.  (Remember,
this thief believed that the portion was greater than 1/20th of the whole).
 He now continues to offer the new pile to the remaining thieves.   Either,
all will agree to let him keep the new portion.  Or, one of them will again
believe that the pile represents more than 1/20 of the whole.
<p>

Again, if all agree, the offering thief has his portion and is no longer
involved.
<p>

And if someone disagrees, he will take over the portion, return something
to the main pile, and continue the process of offering to the remaining
theives.
<p>

This will continue until the first 19 thieves have an opportunity to accept
or reject the offered pile.
<p>

When the last thief is offered the pile he must also return something from
the offered pile to the main pile, if he wants to take it over.
<p>

After the 20th thief has made his decision.  There will be 19 thieves left
to divide the remaining pile.
<p>

They will repeat the above procedure (of course, trying to get 1/19 of the
remaining loot).
<p>

This will continue until there are two thieves left.
Again one will split, and the other will either accept or reject.  If the
split is rejected, the decliner will take the offered pile remove one item
and the offering thief will get that item and the other pile.
<p>

This process works for any number of thieves.
