This is a maze.  The object is to start at the upper left hand corner, (1)
and to make it to the lower right hand corner.  A number says how far
you <b>must</b> move to get to the next spot.  You may move any direction,
vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.  A number that specifies movement
off the board is a "dead end".

1   5   3   4   3   6   7   1   1   6

4   4   3   4   2   6   2   6   2   5

1   3   3   2   5   6   5   2   3   2

2   5   2   5   5   6   4   8   6   1

Solutions must be specified as a sequence of directions e.g. e, se, w, n,
e ... The number of steps to be taken in a particular direction is
determined by the value of that particular position in the maze. Thus for
the given sequence we start by going one step east from the top left
corner, then 5 steps south-east, then 5 steps west, and so on.
