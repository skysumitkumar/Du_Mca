<font color="blue">Question:</font><br>
<P>The Beatles have to be at a concert across the river in 17 minutes. The 
problem is that the bridge across the river is very weak and is strong enough to 
hold only two people at a time (only two people can cross at a time). They have 
only one flashlight and anybody crossing the river must have the flashlight at 
all times. John can cross the bridge in 1 minute, Paul needs 2 minutes, George 
needs 5 minutes and Ringo needs 10. can they make it to the concert in time? If 
so, how? 
<P>(This was apparently a Microsoft interview question.) </P>

Thanks to David Bennett for the explanation!
<p>
John and Paul cross = 2 minutes<br>
John returns with flashlight = 1 minute<br>
He gives the flashlight to George and Ringo.<br>
George and Ringo cross = 10 minutes<br>
Paul returns with flashlight = 2 minutes<br>
John and Paul cross again = 2 minutes.<br>
