<font color="blue">Question:</font><br>
<P>This puzzle is an original creation by <FONT color=blue>John Tripp</FONT> 
<P>In a remote area, several villages are located, such that there is only one 
access road to each village,. This road connects each village with The Meeting 
Place where members of the villages meet to exchange goods, ideas, goodwill, 
etc. 
<P>The highlight of the year is the Harvest Journey. After the harvest, all able 
bodied members of the villages travel to The Meeting Place for a great 
celebration. After the meeting, some will return to their own villages, while 
others will travel to one of the other villages to spend the winter. 
<P>What is the maximum number of villages and the distance from The Meeting 
Place to each village?, if: 
<OL>
<LI>A journey is the total number of halongs(The unit of distance used by the 
villagers.) from the Starting Village to The Meeting Place to the Ending 
Village. (Therefore, If there are 3 villages A,B,C, there would be six possible 
journeys - AA,AB,AC,BB,BC, and CC) 
<LI>Every possible journey is an integer number of halongs. 
<LI>No possible journey, from start to end, is the same distance as any other 
possible journey. 
<LI>No village is more than 100 halongs from The Meeting Place. 
<LI>A journey may begin and end at the same village. 
<LI>Each village is located as close to The Meeting Place as possible, 
consistent with conditions 1-5. </LI></OL>

11 villages:
0.5, 1.5, 3.5, 7.5, 12.5, 20.5, 30.5, 44.5, 65.5, 80.5, 96.5

Remember that the problem states that the "journey" must be an integer.
