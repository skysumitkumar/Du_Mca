<li><a name="handshake"><b>Hand Shake</b></a> <i><font color="green">(Expert)</font></i><p>
A couple invites 4 couples for dinner. When all the guests have arrived,
everybody shakes hands with the person he/she does not know. The host then
asks everybody (except himself, of course) how many people they shook
hands with. Each one of them replies with a different number. How many
people did the hostess shake hands with? Why?
<p>
Comments: You cannot make any assumptions about how many people the hostess knows. There is only one logical soluti
on if you consider all the constraints of this puzzle!

  <li><b>Mysterious Commute</b> <i><font color="green">(Expert)</font></i><p>
The Mayor of a city C couldn't help but notice that a large population traveled from point A to point B and back
 everyday. Moreover, there was no straightforward route, and the commute was long and winding. The Mayor thought
 it would be a great idea to build an expressway  from point A to point B. This would drastically reduce the time for the commute. To the Mayor's surprise, after the expressway was opened, none of these people traveled from
point A to B any more. <p>
What was the reason?

We received many solutions for this puzzle. We thought these were the best.

  <li><a name="coingame"><b>The Coin Game</b></a> <i><font color="green">(Master)</font></i><p>
Alice and Bob are playing a coin game. The rules are as follows: There is a circular table with radius R. There is an infinite supply of identical coins, each with radius r (where r < R). Alice and Bob take turns placing coins on the table. The coins cannot overlap, and they must entirely lie on the table. The first person who cannot place a coin on the table loses.<p>
Does Alice or Bob have a winning strategy? If so, what is it? Your solution should work for all possible values of r and R.
<p>
Comments: A <i>winning strategy</i> means that a certain player is <i>guaranteed</i> to win every time, as long as he/she follows this strategy.<p>

  <li> <a name="trekker"><b>Trekker</b></a> <font color="green">(Expert)</font></i><p>
  A trekker begins her ascent at 6am until she reaches the summit later that day. She walks at varying speeds, with frequent stops along the way. After spending a few days atop the mountain, she begins her descent at 6am one fine day. She follows her original path, and walks down at varying speeds with frequent stops. Her walking patterns on the way up, and on the way down have no connection whatsoever, except that she probably walks faster on the way down than on the way up. 
<p>
Prove that there is a spot along the path that she will occupy on both her treks at exactly the same time of the day.

  <li><b>The Mad Hatter</b> <i><font color="green">(Intermediate)</font></i><p>

The March Hare and the Mad Hatter were sipping their eggnog
     and watching the crowd when Alice happened to glance in the
     Hare's direction and ask, "Why are you giving me such an
     angry look?"
<br>
     "I'm not *giving* it to you, I'm giving it *back*," replied
     the Hare.
<br>
     "I didn't look crossly at you."
<br>
     "Well, *somebody* did," the Hare said, turning to glare at
     the Hatter.
<br>
     Just then, someone came up from behind and put his hands
     over the Hatter's eyes.
<br>
     "Guess who!" said the newcomer in a thin, flat voice.
<br>
     The Hatter froze for a moment and declared, rather coldly,
     "I have no use for practical jokers."
<br>
     "Ha! Neither have I," retorted the stranger, still keeping
     his hands over the Hatter's eyes.
<br>
     At that, the Hatter seemed to accept the challenge of the
     game and started asking a series of questions in a manner
     that mingled hope with care.
<p>
     Question: "Ahem. Would you, by chance, be in a black suit
     this evening?"<br>
     Answer: "I would, but not by chance, by design."
<p>
     Q: "I presume you're a member of all the posh clubs?"<br>
     A: "Afraid not. Never even been invited."
<p>
     Q: "Surely you're better than average?" <br>
     A: "Yes, indeed!"
<p>
     Q: "Not spotted, I hope?"<br>
     A: "Knock wood."

     Q: "Married?"<br>
     A: "No, happy."

The more I stand still, the faster I run. What am I?
<p>
Comments: This is not the same as saying, "The faster I run, the more I
stand still." Hence a solution like "gyroscope" will not work. This is
because the cause/effect relationship has been reversed in this case.

  <li><b>Ali Baba</b> <i><font color="green">(Expert)</font></i><p>

This is one of Raymond Smullyan's cooler logic puzzles.
<p>
                      Twenty of Ali Baba's thieves once captured an enormous plunder consisting of diamonds, emeralds,
                      rubies, gold coins, chocolate and other goodies. Then came the question of dividing the loot so that
                      each of the twenty believed he had his fair share. Now, some prefer jewels, some prefer chocolate
                      and so on. In other words, different members will have different ideas as to what constitutes one
                      twentieth of the loot. So it won't work for one person to simply divide the loot into what he considers
                      twenty equal parts and pass the parts around; many would be dissatisfied. However, it is possible to
                      make a division such that each person feels satisfied that he has got at least one twentieth of the loot.
                      Of course there is nothing special about the number twenty; the same could be done with a hundred
                      people, or any number of people. For example, the way to do it with only two people is as follows :
                      One person divides the material into what he considers two equal parts and lets the other person
                      choose which part he wants. Then both are bound to be satisfied. The question is how do you adapt
                      this to twenty people?
