Prove that in a group of six people, there are either three mutual acquaintances, or three mutual strangers.

<font color="blue">Answer:</font><br>
Consider a person A. Either A knows at least 3 people, or A does not know 3 or more people. Without loss of generality (WLOG), let's assume that A knows at least 3 people. Let three of these people be B, C and D. Now, if B, C and D do not know each other, we are done. However, if even one pair does not know each other (WLOG we can assume this to be B and C), then we A, B and C know each other. Hence in a group of 6 people, we must have either 3 mutual acquaitences, or three mutual strangers.
