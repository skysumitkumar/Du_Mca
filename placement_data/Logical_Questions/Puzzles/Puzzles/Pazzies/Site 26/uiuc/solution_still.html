<font color="blue">Question:</font><br>
The more I stand still, the faster I run. What am I? 
<p>

                      Comments: This is not the same as saying, "The faster I run, the more I stand still." Hence a
                      solution like "gyroscope" will not work. This is because the cause/effect relationship has been
                      reversed in this case. Also, for those people who are into physics, please send us
                      non-relativistic solutions only!

An hourglass!<p>

You could have also sent in a relativistic solution:<br>
A clock/watch. The faster it moves, the slower the time progresses for that clock. So, the more this watch stands still, the faster it will run. We were looking for the "hourglass" answer though. This relativistic solution might be of some amusement to Physicists. :-)

a running nose ...
twitching it seems to keep it from running .. at least for me
