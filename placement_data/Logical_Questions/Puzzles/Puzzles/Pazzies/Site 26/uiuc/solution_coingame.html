<font color="blue">Question:</font><br>
Alice and Bob are playing a coin game. The rules are as follows: There is a circular table with radius R. There is an infinite supply of identical coins, each with radius r (where r < R). Alice and Bob take turns placing coins on the table. The coins cannot overlap, and they must entirely lie on the table. The first person who cannot place a coin on the table loses.<p>
Does Alice or Bob have a winning strategy? If so, what is it? Your solution should work for all possible values of r and R.
<p>
Comments: A <i>winning strategy</i> means that a certain player is <i>guaranteed</i> to win every time, as long as he/she follows this strategy.<p>

<p>
<font color="blue">Answer:</font><br>
Whoever goes first has a winning strategy:<p>
The first player (say Alice) should place the coin at the center of the table on the first move. From then on, Alice just duplicates Bob's move by placing a coin diametrically opposite from his coin. That way Alice is <i>always</i> guaranteed a move after Bob's move. The game goes on until Bob cannot place a coin on the table. Alice always wins! Note that if Alice does not place a coin in the center of the table on her first move, she cannot use this strategy.
