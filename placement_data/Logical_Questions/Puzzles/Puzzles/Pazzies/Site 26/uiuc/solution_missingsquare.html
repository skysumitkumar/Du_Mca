The trick is in realizing that the two figures are <b>not</b> triangles! If you look at the hypotenuse of the red triangle, you will notice that it has a slope of 3/8. The hypotenuse of the green triangle has a slope of 2/5. If you add up the areas of the individual pieces, you will see that the areas are actually equal.
