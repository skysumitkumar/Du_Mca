<font color="blue">Question:</font><br>
How can you test a number for divisibility by 11

<p>
<font color="blue">Answer:</font><br>
Thanks to Dan Higgins for his explanation!
<p>
<ol>
<li>Add the digits in odd number columns (ones, hundreds, ten-thousands, etc.)
<li> Add the digits in even number columns (tens, thousands, hundred-thousands,
etc.)
<li>If the difference is divisible by 11, the number is divisible by 11.
</ol>

<p>
Example:
<br>
Number:  22846193705192
<br>
1.  2+1+0+3+1+4+2=13
<br>
2.  9+5+7+9+6+8+2=46
<br>
3.  46-13=33.  Divisible by 11 (22846193705192 / 11 = 2076926700472).

John Tripp adds another very amazing test, that even yields the divisor!<p>
<pre>
   Take the number  For example 7029 and write it down.

   Now put .0 just under the units position.

   7 0 2 9
        .0

   now we will work right to left.

   Subtract number just put down from number directly above, put result in
 next position to left.
   7 0 2 9
       9.0
   Repeat step

   7 0 2 9
     3 9.0

   Repeat Step

   7 0 2 9
   6 3 9.0

  If the last subtraction, using left most digit from tested number yields 0
 then number is divisible by 11, and the number on line 2 is the divisor.
