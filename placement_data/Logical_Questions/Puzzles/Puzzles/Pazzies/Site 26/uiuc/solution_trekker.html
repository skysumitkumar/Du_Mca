<font color="blue">Question:</font><br>
A trekker begins her ascent at 6am until she reaches the summit later that day. She walks at varying speeds,
                             with frequent stops along the way. After spending a few days atop the mountain, she begins her descent at 6am
                             one fine day. She follows her original path, and walks down at varying speeds with frequent stops. Her walking
                             patterns on the way up, and on the way down have no connection whatsoever, except that she probably walks
                             faster on the way down than on the way up. 
<p>

                             Prove that there is a spot along the path that she will occupy on both her treks at exactly the same time of the
                             day.

Thanks to John Tripp for the explanation!<p>
For my sanity, I will call the trekker Sally.
Suppose Sally begins her trek down at 6AM, and a friend begins the trek up
at the same time (duplicating Sally's movements on the first day).  If both
complete their journey, will they pass each other during their treks?  The
answer is obviously yes, or neither will reach their goal.
