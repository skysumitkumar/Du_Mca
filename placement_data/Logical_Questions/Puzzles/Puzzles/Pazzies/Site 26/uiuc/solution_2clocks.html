<font color="blue">Question:</font><br>
<p>
Two friends, whom we will call Arthur and Robert, were curators at the
Museum of American History. Both were born in the month of May, one in
1932 and the other a year later.
<p>

Each was in charge of a beautiful antique clock. Both of the clocks worked
pretty well, considering their ages, but one of them lost ten seconds an
hour and the other gained ten seconds an hour.
<p>

On one bright day in January, the two friends set both clocks right at
exactly 12 noon.
<p>

``You realize,'' said Arthur, ``that the clocks will start drifting apart,
and they won't be together again until---let's see---why, on the very day
you will be 47 years old. Am I right?''
<p>

Robert then made a short calculation. ``That's right!'' he said.
<p>

Who is older, Arthur or Robert? You must explain your answer.
<p>

<font color="blue">Answer:</font><br>
Robert is older.
<p>
Here is <font color="blue">Jennifer Yu's</font> explanation:<br>
It would take 2160 hours or 90 days for the clocks to be together again.
The clocks were set together in either 1979 or 1980.  But if you calculate
the time spent, the 90th day, the day that the clocks meet, will be May 1st,
if the first day is Jan 31st.  This would happen in the year 1979, not 1980
because 1980 is a leap year.  If this were to happen in 1980, the clocks
would meet on April 30th.  In 1979, Robert will be 47 and Arthur will be 46.
