<font color="blue">Question:</font><br>
Box A contains $1000, and box B contains $100. You have to pick one of
these boxes. If everyone picks A, then everyone gets 1000 (imaginary)
dollars. If even one person picks B, then the people who picked A get
nothing. If at least one fourth of the people pick B, then they (the ones
who pick B) each get 100 (imaginary) dollars. If less than one-fourth of
the people pick B, then they get nothing. Pick either A or B, and state
your reasoning.

<font color="blue">Answer:</font><br>
There are close to 400 people on our mailing list, and yet only 29 people replied. Whoa! :-)
<p>
15/29 (51.7%) people picked B. All the people who picked B get a 100 imaginary dollars! Congratulations!
<p>
Here's the tally:

Here are some of the explanations that people gave (picked arbitrarily):
<ol>
  <li> <font color="blue">rjkaw</font> - Pick box "B": I control my own destiny. There are 0 "A" possibilities {I picked "B"} and maybe enough "B"'s will turn up. 
  <li> <font color="blue"> Myron Chaitovsky</font> -  I  will pick A because:
Most intelligent people want to come away with the most they can get
($1,000).
Even if a spoiler comes along to pick B, ruining all A-pickers' take,
that B selector comes away with nothing unless 25% of the players also
decide to be spoilers,
which is not likely.
So unless some B's animus against some A is such the s/he is willing to
let both walk away with nothing
it makes sense to pick A--and both person A and B are equally  $1,000
richer.
  <li> <font color="blue">  Vikas Ahuja</font> - I'd pick A and hope for the $1000 :)

There are two reasons for my choice:
<br>
One:
Let the probability of everyone picking A be x.
Then the probability of atleast 1/4th picking B <= 4x.<br>
Mathematical expectation on picking A = $1000x
Mathematical expectation on picking B <= $100(4x)
<br>
Thus I can expect more if I pick A.
<br>
Two:
Now that I know everyone knows the rules, I'd assume everyone wants
$1000 more than $100, and that noone wants to cut anyone else out by
deliberately picking B. I'd feel safer picking A.
  <li> <font color="blue">richnewton </font> - I choose A because I believe in the goodness of man.
  <li> Here is an interesting analysis by <font color="blue">Siddhartha Mathur</font>
<pre>
 Here's the mathematics behind the problem
 Assume the probability that someone picks A is "x" => pr[B] = (1-x)
 Let the total sample set be "S"
 => Expected number of people picking B = (1-x)S
 => Pr[ >25% pick B ] <= 4(1-x) { by markov's inequality }
 Expected money from B <= 400(1-x)
 Expected money from A = 1000x^S
 So, as the sample set grows bigger and bigger choosing A gets to be a worse 
 option
 BUT, WE REALIZE THIS IS ASSUMING A PROBABILITY GENERATOR(x) AND THIS 
 QUESTION IS NOT ABOUT THAT
 The question here is not as much about probability as about variance... a 
 single deviation point could completely change decisions
 
 Here is my reasoning that i adopt for choosing B
 In an ideal world (define an ideal world to be composed of not only 
 intelligent people, but also people that can accurately predict and trust 
 the actions of others) everyone would pick A
 But, anyone that has invested in the stock market understands that things 
 work out best when you think like the others(who in turn think like others, 
 thereby propagating the web of trust model at an ever decreasing trust 
 level) IF even one person chooses B, there is no merit to my choosing A. 
 However, choosing B is an option with a much smaller variance. Hence, i 
 expect the other person to choose B, which is why i choose B, and so must 
 all other "intelligent" people. B is a surer way of making "some" money.
