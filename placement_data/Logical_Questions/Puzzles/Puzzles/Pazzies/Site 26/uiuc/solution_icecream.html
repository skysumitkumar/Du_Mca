Dakotah and Cassie are outside an ice cream shop. Cassie tells Dakotah, "I will buy you an ice cream cone
                           if you tell me the answer to this question: How is half of 5, 4?" Dakotah thinks about this for a minute and
                           then Cassie buys him and ice cream. What did Dakotah say?

Remove F and E from 'Five' and you are left with IV, the Roman Numeral for four.
