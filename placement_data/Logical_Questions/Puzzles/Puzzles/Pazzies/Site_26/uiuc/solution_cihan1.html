<br>Correction to above image - The numbers below 3, 5 and 9 should be  90, 88 and 94 respectively. Thanks to Hjallti for pointing this out.

98<p>
Here is <font color="blue">Kyle DeWitt's</font> explanation:<br>
Considering the way the numbers are deliberately printed in block form, make a 3 x 5 grid where each block of the grid
corresponds to a block of the number


a    b   c            Each letter will have a value.  (ie. c+e+h+j+m =45 as they form the number 1).  So the sum of a-m=104 (number d         e            8)   As 0 and 8 differ only by the "g block" and there sums differ by 8, g=8.  As 3 and 9 differ only by the "d block" 
f    g    h            and their sums differ by 4, d=4.  3 and 8 differ by the "d block" and the "i block", and their
sums differ by 14.
i          j            d=4 so i=10.  2 and 8 differ by the "e block" and the "i block", their sums differ by 16, and
i=10 so e=6.  6 and 8
k    l   m            differ only by the "e block" therefore 6 corresponds to "8"-e or 104-6=98.
