<font color="blue">Question:</font><br>
You have 12 coins in your possession. All the 12 coins look and feel the same 
. But one of the coins is different in terms of weight. You are given a simple 
balance and three chances to come up with the dissimilar coin. You also need to 
determine whether the coin is heavy or lighter than the other coins. It should 
work for all the situations. For your convenience you may number the coins 1, 2, 
3, etc.

(A) If  coins 1+2+3+4=5+6+7+8 then one of 9 to 12 different weight.
               1+2+3+9>7+8+11+12 then 9 heavy or 11 or 12 light since we
know 1,2,3,7,8 equal.
                      11=12 then  9 HEAVY.
                      11>12 then 12 LIGHT.
                      11<12 then 11 LIGHT.

           1+2+3+9<7+8+11+12 then 9 light or 11 or 12 heavy.
                      11=12 then  9 LIGHT.
                      11>12 then 11 HEAVY
                      12>11 then 12 HEAVY

           1+2+3+9=7+8+11+12 then 10 heavy or light.
                       10>8 then 10 heavy.
                       10<8 then 10 light.

(B) If coins 1+2+3+4>5+6+7+8 then one of 1 to 8 different weight.
             1+2+5+6>3+7+11+12 then 1 or 2 heavy or 7 light since we
know 11,12 equal and 5,6 cannot be heavy.
                        1=2 then 7 light
                        1>2 then 1 heavy
                        2>1 then 2 heavy

              1+2+5+6<3+7+11+12 then 5 or 6 light or 3 heavy.
                        5=6 then 3 heavy.
                        5<6 then 5 light.
                        6<5 then 6 light.

              1+2+5+6=3+7+11+12 then 4 heavy or 8 light.
                        4>9 then 4 heavy.
                        4=9 then 8 light

(C)If coins 1+2+3+4<5+6+7+8 then one of 1 to 8 different weight.
             1+2+5+6<3+7+11+12 then 1or 2 light or 7 heavy.
                          1>2 then 2 light.
                          1<2 then 1 light.
                          1=2 then 7 heavy.

              1+2+5+6>3+7+11+12 then 5or 6 heavy or 3 light.
                          5>6 then 5 heavy.
                          5<6 then 6 heavy.
                          5=6 then 3 light.

              1+2+5+6=3+7+11+12 then 4 light or 8 heavy.
