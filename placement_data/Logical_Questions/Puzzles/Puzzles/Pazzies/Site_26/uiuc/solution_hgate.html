<font color="blue">Question:</font><br>
You die and find yourself confronted by two guards at the gates of heaven and hell. You know that one of the guards always tells the truth, and the other always lies. You don't know which is which, and by asking one, and only one, question you need to figure out which one is the gate to Heaven (or hell, if you're adventurous). What will you ask? (Note: You can't combine two questions by using an 'and'...of course) 

<p>
<font color="blue">Answer:</font><br>
You need to ask the following question to any of the guards: "What gate would the other guard point to if I asked him/her which one was the gate to heaven?". The gate that the guard (the one you asked the question) points to, is the gate to hell.  
<p>Here's another cool way of looking at it (thanks to <font color="blue">Greg Jones</font>):<br>
      To either of the guards:  " If I had asked you yesterday, which is
 the gate to Heaven, what would have been your answer?"

     Whatever answer you receive is the correct answer. (this one would
 work even if there was only one guard, and you didn't know whether he
 was the angel or demon)
