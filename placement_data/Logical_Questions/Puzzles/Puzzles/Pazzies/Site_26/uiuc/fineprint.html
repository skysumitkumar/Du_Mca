<hr>
Sorry about this folks, but to maintain the sanity of our site we need to mention the following. :-)

<ol>
 <li> Coolpuzzles is not responsible for the order in which it receives its emails. Obviously the internet is a crazy place, and email sent at a certain time has has very little to do with when we actually receive it.
 <li> Sometimes our email account may go overquota and your email might be bounced back. Coolpuzzles is not responsible for lost email. Somebody sent us a humongous BMP file as a solution once and we lost some mail!
 <li> Coolpuzzles will try their best to reasonably word their puzzles. Sometimes, due to the inherent nature of the english language, loopholes may exist, but Coolpuzzles has the right to reject solutions. If a puzzle is unclear, please let us know and we will try to reword it suitably.
 <li> Coolpuzzles has the right to reject correct solutions. Your name will be put up on our site solely at our discretion. Some solutions, although correct, tend to be pretty inelegant. In such cases, we will give credit to the more elegant solutions. Another case for rejection of solutions is if we believe that you did not solve the puzzle yourself (e.g. cut-and-paste from an online solution).
 <li> Coolpuzzles has the right to use your name unless otherwise specified by you. If you change your mind, please let us know and we will be happy to add/remove your name.
 <li> Coolpuzzles has the right to quote your solutions in verbatim. Hey, sometimes we receive some pretty elegant solutions!
 <li> Coolpuzzles has the right to modify the ratings of their puzzles at any time. 
 <li> You have the right to enjoy our website.

</ol>
