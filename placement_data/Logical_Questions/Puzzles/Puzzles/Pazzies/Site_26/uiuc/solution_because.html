<font color="blue">Question:</font><br>
Do you know of a grammatically correct english sentence in which the wor
d <i>because</i> is repeated three times consecutively?

<p>
<font color="blue">Answer:</font><br>
A word which cannot appear at the beginning of a sentence is because,
because because is a conjunction.
<p>
Thanks to Fred for this alternative solution:<br>
Please say the word "because," because "because " is music to my ears.
