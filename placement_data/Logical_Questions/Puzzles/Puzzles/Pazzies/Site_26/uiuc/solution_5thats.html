<font color="blue">Question:</font><br>
Make a sentence using the word that five times in in a row. 

<p>
<font color="blue">Answer:</font><br>
Thanks to Mike Dickheiser for this solution:<p>
Did you know that that "that", that that copier smudged, was supposed to be
in italics?
<p>And here is Mike Dickheiser going all out: <p>

Sentence using 6 thats, based on the following sentence fragment:
<p>

... THAT that  tHaT  THAT ...
<p>

Did you know that that "that", that that "THAT" sits next to, should be
capitalized?
<p>

And even 7:

<p>
Did you know that that "that", that that "THAT" (that I wrote) sits next to,
should be capitalized?
<p>

And finally, a somewhat contrived dialog that generates 5 "thats" in which
the letters appear in proper order but not necessarily in the word "that":
<p>

Friend 1: "Did you hear about Bob putting his bathtub beside the big paper
hat with the 'T' on it?"
<p>

Friend 2: "No, did he take a bath beside it?"
<p>

Friend 1: "Yes!"
<p>

Friend 2: "What?! Bob took a bath at that T hat? That 'T' hath not much ink
on it and will smudge if he gets it wet!"
<p>

here are the "thats" in the last sentence:
baTH  AT   THAT  T HAT? THAT 'T' HATh not...
<p>

Ok, so that was pretty bad...but you guys started it!
