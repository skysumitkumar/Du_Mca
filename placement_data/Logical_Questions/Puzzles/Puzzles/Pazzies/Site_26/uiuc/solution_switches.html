There are 100 switches numbered 1 to 100. There are 100 people numbered 1 to 100 Person x
                        comes and toggles all switches that are multiples of x i.e., person 1 toggles 1,2,3,..., then 2 toggles
                        2,4,6,..., then 3 toggles 3, 6,9,..., etc. and at the end, person 100 toggles the 100th switch All switches
                        are initially off. How many switches are ON at the end?

Thanks to Kathy Dunham for the explanation!

There would be 10 switches on at the end- the number of perfect squares found 
between 1 and 100.  In order for the switch to be on at the end, it would 
have to be toggled an odd number of times.  The only way for that to happen 
is if one of the factorizations of that number is repeated (or squared).
