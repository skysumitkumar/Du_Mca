<font color="blue">Question:</font><br>
How can you test a number for divisibility by 7? 

<p>
<font color="blue">Answer:</font><br>
Multiply the last digit by 2. Subtract this answer from the remaining digits. 
If this new number is evenly divisible by 7, then so is the original number.
<p>For example, for a 3 digit number, here is Kathy Dunham's example (Thanks!):
"...Try 378.  The last digit is 8.
Multiply by 2 and you get 16.  Subtract 16 from 37 and get 21.  21 is
divisible by 7 which means that 378 is as well."
<p>For a larger number you would keep repeating these steps until you ended up with something smaller!

Here is what Eric Smith added: <br>
works for numbers less than 7000...
<br> 
 multiply the number by 143. If the result is less than 6 digits, pad it
 on the left end with zeroes until it is 6 digits (i.e., 12012 becomes
 012012). If the the first three digits are the same as the last three,
 the inital number is divisible by 7.
<p>Thanks to Fred for this cool algorithm (it worked for all the numbers that we tried!):<br>
    Taking the digits from right to left, multiply by the following repeating 
sequence:
        x1,x3,x2,x6,x4,x5 etc.  Add the results and see if they are divisible 
by 7.

        i.e.:    5201 would be  (1x1)+(0x3)+(2x2)+(5x6)=35, 35 is divisible 
by 7, 
            therefore 5201 is divisible by 7.

Here is some more insight from <font color="blue">Etamar Olpiner </font><br>
<pre>
Use the fact that 7 divides 49.
So, if 7 divides X, 7 also divides X-49 = X-50+1
If X = Q*50 + R, you can reduce X by 49, and do it Q times.
So divide X by 50 (multipie X by 2 and divide by 100), add the remainder (R)
to the result (Q), and check for division by 7.
i.e.
To check if 7 divides 1232 = 24*50  +  32
just check if 7 divides 24 + 32= 56 (which is 1232- 50+1 -50+1 ... -50+1 (24
times))
and it does.

Note: if the result is too big, just do it again, like this:
does 7 divide 355348 ?
355300 / 50 = 7106
so 355348 = 50*7106 + 48
7106+48 = 7154

7150 / 50 = 143
so 7154 = 50 * 143 + 4
143+4 = 147

147 = 2*50 + 47
2+47 = 49

and 7 divides 49
