<font color="blue">Question:</font><br>
A couple invites 4 couples for dinner. When all the guests have arrived,
everybody shakes hands with the person he/she does not know. The host then
asks everybody (except himself, of course) how many people they shook
hands with. Each one of them replies with a different number. How many
people did the hostess shake hands with? Why?
<p>

<font color="blue">Answer:</font><br>
The hostess shakes hands with 4 people.
<p>
Obviously nobody can shake hands with more than 8 people (everybody knows his/her spouse, and cannot shake hands with himself/herself). Since the host is the one asking the question, he asks 9 people. They all give him a different answer, so the answers have to be the numbers 0 through 8. The host will have to have a number that overlaps with somebody else.<p>
Consider a person P. If P shook hands with 8 people, P's spouse PP could not have been one of them. But since P shook hands with everyone else besides PP, PP shook hands with 0 people. Now consider Q and Q's spouse QQ. Let Q shake hands with 7 people. QQ has already shaken hands with P, and Q did not shake hands with QQ, so QQ shook hands with only 1 person (P). Similarly we get 6 and 3, and 4 and 4. <p>
We know that the host shakes hands with a non-unique number of people. Therefore the husband shook hands with 4 people. Therefore, his spouse shook 4 hands.
