<font color="blue">Question:</font><br>
There are two cars facing each other and are 10 miles apart (bumper to bumper). There is a fly sitting on one of the car's bumpers. The two cars start moving towards each other at 5 miles/hour. The fly simultaneously starts flying (with an average speed of 15 miles/hour) towards the other car's bumper. When it reaches the other car's bumper, it instantaneously changes direction and starts flying towards the other car's bumper. The fly repeats this and keeps flying from bumper to bumper until the two cars collide, and the fly meets an untimely death. Calculate the total distance that the fly flies.

<p>
<font color="blue">Answer:</font><br>
The fly flies 15 miles. This is actually a lot easier than it seems at first. If you notice, the two cars will collide in 1 hour, and since the fly's <i>average speed </i> is 15 miles/hour, the fly would have flown 15 miles!
