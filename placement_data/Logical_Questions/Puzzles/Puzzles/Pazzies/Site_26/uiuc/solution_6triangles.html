<font color="blue">Question:</font><br>
Using six matchsticks of equal length, construct at least 4 equilateral triangles in two
                           dimensions. Note - you cannot break the matchsticks! Also, you can assume that the
                           matchsticks are thin enough, so that if they overlap, they are still in "two dimensions".
                           Solutions with more than 4 triangles will be given extra credit!

6 triangles. Let us know if you can make more. Note, we specified
<i>non-overlapping</i> triangles. This figure actually has 8 equilateral
triangles, but only 6 of them are non-overlapping!<p>
This figure isn't exact, but that's the general idea. <br>
