<font color="blue">Question:</font><br>
This puzzle is really cool. If you drill a cylindrical hole, that is six inches
                    long, through the center of a sphere, what is the remaining volume of
                    the sphere? The diameter of the cylinder is not negligible. Explain your
                    answer. Yes, the data is sufficient! 


<p>
<font color="blue">Answer:</font><br>
36*pi cubic inches
<p>
After writing down some funky math equations for the volume of a sphere with radius R, and a cylinder of height 6, and the volume of the 2 dome caps above and below the cylinder, all terms cancel out to leave 36*pi. <p>
Therefore, no matter what the radius of the sphere is, if you cut out a cylinder through the center such that the height is 6 inches, the remaining volume will always be 36*pi!
<p>

Let R be the radius of the sphere. The radius of the cylindrical hole will then be
sqrt(R^2 - 9). The height of the spherical caps at each end of the cylinder will be R-3.
To determine what is left after the cylinder and the caps have been removed, we do the 
following:
<p>

Add the volume of the cylinder 6*PI*(R^2 - 9)<br>
Add twice the volume of the spherical caps where the volume of a spherical cap
is PI*A*(3r^2 + A^2)/6, where A is the altitude of the cap (R -3), and r is the radius of the cap, sqrt(R^2 - 9)<br>
Subtract this from the volume of the sphere (4/3)*PI*R^3
<p>
You are left with 36*PI, the volume of the remaining solid. As you can see, the volume
of this remaining solid is constant, regardless of the cylindrical hole's radius, or the
radius of the sphere!
