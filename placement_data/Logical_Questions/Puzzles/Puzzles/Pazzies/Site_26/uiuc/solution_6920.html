<font color="blue">Question:</font><br>
You are given an infinite supply of weights of 6, 9 and 20. Using only these 
weights, what is the largest weight that you cannot measure? You use a simple 
balance, but you can only place the weights on one of the pans. So, for example, 
you cannot weigh 3 by putting 6 in one pan and 9 in the other pan. </P>

43
