<font color="blue">Question:</font><br>
A town has two hospitals, one big and one small. Every day the big hospital delivers 1000 babies and the small hospital
                        delivers 100 babies. There's a 50/50 chance of male or female on each birth. Which hospital has a better chance of
                        having the same number of boys as girls? You must explain your answer. 

<p>
<font color="blue">Answer:</font><br>
The hospital with fewer babies has a higher probability. 
<p>
A Bernoulli trial is an experiment having only two possible outcomes: success or failure. Flipping a coin is an example of a Bernoulli trial. Whether it snows on Christmas Day or not is a Bernoulli trial. Whether you get called on to recite in Spanish
class is a Bernoulli trial. (You decide which alternative is a success and which is a failure.) Similary, whether a male is born or not (and hence a female is born) is also a Bernoulli trial.<p>
Theorem: Suppose a Bernoulli trial has probability p of success and probability q = 1 - p of failure. Then the probability of obtaining exactly
k successes in n independent trials is<br>

                                              P(k) = C(n, k)·p^kq^(n-k).
<p>
For the hospital with a 100 babies, n=100, k=50, p=0.5, q=0.5. 
Therefore, P(50) = 0.07959
<p>
Similarly, for the hospital with a 1000 babies, n=1000, k=500, p=0.5, q=0.5.
Therefore, P(500) = 0.02523
<p>
We can see that P(50) > P(500). Hence the hospital with a 100 babies has a higher chance.
