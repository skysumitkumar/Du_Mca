in norse myth, mjollnir is the hammer that belongs to the mighty god thor.
mjollnir ("that smashes") was made for him by the dwarfs brok and eitri,
who made many magical objects for the gods.  every time thor threw the
hammer lightning flashed, after which it returned to his right hand, on
which he wore an iron glove.  mjollnir was greatly feared by the frost
giants, the enemies of the gods, for thor had dispatched a large number of
them, among which was the giant hrungnir.
