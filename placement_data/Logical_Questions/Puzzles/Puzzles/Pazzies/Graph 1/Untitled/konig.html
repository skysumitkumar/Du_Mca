K&ouml;nigsburg was founded by the Teutonic Knights in 1255 at the meeting
point of two branches of the river Pregel, and went on to be the capital of
Prussia. It was flattened by bombing raids during the Second World War, and
was annexed by the Soviet Union in 1945, at which stage it was renamed
Kaliningrad. Today, it is in the small Russian parcel of land on the Baltic
Sea that is wedged between Lithuania and Northeastern Poland.<br><br>
Many famous figures in history were born in K&ouml;nigsburg, including the
philosopher Immanuel Kant, the mathematicians Christian Goldbach and David
Hilbert, and the physicist Gustav Kirchhoff. To mathematicians, though,
K&ouml;nigsburg is best known for a puzzle associated with its seven bridges
(shown in blue on the map): its citizens pondered for a long time whether it
was possible to walk about the city in such a way that you cross all seven
bridges over the river Pregel exactly once.</td><td><center>

a fun but inconsequential problem. However it was the inspiration for a 1736

target="_top">Leonhard Euler</a> (1707-1783) which arguably began the field
of topology. In this paper, Euler proved that there was no such path around
the city. In fact Euler gives a simple criterion which determines whether or
not there is a solution to any similar problem with any number of bridges
connecting any number of landmasses!<br><br>

Euler first simplified the problem, replacing each landmass by a
<b>vertex</b> (yellow dot) and each bridge by an <b>arc</b> (black
path). Such a configuration of vertices and connecting arcs is nowadays
known as a <b>graph</b>. The original problem is equivalent to the problem
of travelling around the graph in such a way that you cross each arc exactly
once. Defining the <b>degree</b> of a vertex to be the number of arcs that
lead to it, Euler proved:<br><br>

<b>Theorem</b> <i>There exists a (at least one) path on a graph which
travels along each arc exactly once if and only if the graph has at most two
vertices of odd degree.</i><br><br>

Such a path on a graph, if it exists, is now called an <b>Euler path</b> in
his honour. The K&ouml;nigsburg example has three vertices of degree three,
and one of degree five, so it has no Euler path and the original puzzle has
no solution.<br><br>

The key to the proof of (one direction of) Euler's result is the realisation
that if a vertex is not the initial or final vertex of a path and each bridge
is only used once, then the number of arcs that are traversed leading
to/from that vertex must be even (each time you go through a vertex, you use
one arc to get there and another to leave). This also shows that if there
are two vertices of odd degree, one must be the initial vertex of the Euler
path and the other the final vertex.  Incidentally, notice that the number
of vertices of odd degree in any graph must be even since the sum of all
the degrees is double the number of vertices.<br><br>

<b>Exercise:</b> Determine whether each of the four graphs below has an
Euler graph. If it does, find one.<br><br>

This is a great example of the power of abstraction in mathematics. The
original problem was tricky enough to be an ongoing topic of debate among
the citizens of K&ouml;nigsburg even though it has only four landmasses and
seven bridges. The four graphs in the exercise are much more complicated
(they correspond to problems with between 9 and 12 landmasses, and between
11 and 23 bridges), and yet finding the answer is a simple matter with what
we now know. By counting, you will have noticed that two of the above graphs
have no Euler paths, and two have but only if we start and finish at two
specific points in each instance.<br><br>
