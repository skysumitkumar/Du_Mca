 Hughes Software Systems ( Gurgaon )
 ----------------------------------- 

 two people came from interview
 (1) Rakesh Jain ( project manager )
 (2) Mrs. Geeta Arora ( senior HRD manager )


 selection procedure:
 (1) aptitude test

     part1.  25 questions in 20 mins (GRE analytical)
     part2.  50 questions in 45 mins (C,microprocessors,communication theory,
             architecture, logic design , boolean algebra,
             amplifiers,OS,networks).Many of the questions were repeated from
             last year with minor modifications and most were from ARCO - "guide
             to GRE computer science"
            
             speed and practice are essential to clear this type of test. It was
             much tougher in terms of difficulty and time given than the Novell
             test.

 (2) interview
             
 questions asked in  interview.

 some answers I have shown,others are left out because they
 are obvious.

 (1) a few words about yourself as a person
 (2) family background
 (3) why go from assam to recw(so far off) for btech?
 (4) why joined mtech ? any regrets about it ? who influenced you to come here?
 (5) would you like to work in delhi ? why ? what kind of work you like ?
 (6) why did you make your passport ?
 (7) will you go abroad ?

 (8) main fields of interest
     ans- OS,networks,compilers,web

 (9) which OS you are familiar with ?
     ans- unix

 (10) define unix as a type of OS.
 (11) what are the basic differences between DOS,windows and unix ?
 (12) is windows multitasking ?
 (13) how does unix schedule processes ?
 (14) does the prompt in the computer come from kernel or shell ?
 (15) can a single kernel have multiple shells ?
 (16) can a single kernel have multiple OSes ?
     ans- yes, eg. Mach microkernel
 (17) what shells you have been exposed to ? what are the basic
      differences between them ?
 (18) how is memory management done in unix ?
 (19) describe demand paging ? 
 (20) what is fragmentation ? what kinds of fragmentation are there ?
 (21) what kinds of fragmentation does unix suffer from ?
 (22) define thrashing 
 (23) describe how the filesystem is implemented in unix
 (24) how can you prevent fragmentation ?

 (25) how does a recursive function call work with regard
      to allocation of storage for variables ?
 (26) any disadvantages of recursion ?
 (27) can all recursive programs be made non-recursive ?
      ans- yes, by using a stack to simulate recursion
 (28) define syntax error and semantic error. give an
      example of each in C.
 (29) why is a non-recursive solution faster ?
      ans- no function call overhead
 (30) define and differentiate between program, process and
      thread.
 (31) would you like to work in systems or application area ?
      ans- systems

  My personal impression is that as long as you can convince them you
  are interested in the company's field of work and will definitely 
  join them, technical mistakes do not matter too much.So the personal
  part of the interview should be well planned for rather than treated as
  a short informal conversation.It is helpful to act a bit slow rather than
  oversmart.Showing an air of being desperate for a job also helps in certain
  cases.
