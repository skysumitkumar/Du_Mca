Hello, I am P.v.nageswara rao. I got selected in Novell. Here are the
interview proceedings.

 (Two persons, one Mr. Girish Elchuri, and Ms. Naina Prasad interviewed me.)

  NP). Introduce yourself.
  A).  I am so and so, i did that, i did this, blah, blah, blah .....

  G). What are your areas of interest ?
  A). Networks, Operating Systems.

  G). Tell me about your thesis ?
  A). well, CC network management, NFS, filesystems, blah,blah, blah....

  G). What is difference between TCP and UDP ?
  A). Usual one 

  G). How does TCP respond to congestion ?
  A). usual one.
  
  G). How is TCP a reliable protocol ?
  A). retransmits, sequence no's and timeouts.

  G). Why do you need netid,hostid  in IP addresses, why not single host id ?
  A). usual one.

  G). Imagine a real life situation in which a router is connected to 50,000
      networks. Now, give me an algorithm for extremely fast routing ?
  A). Use a associative array.

  G). Associative array is practically infeasible. any other solution ?
  A). Have a hierarchial routing table,

  G). well, note the fact that network traffic is bursty and that there is a high
      probability of two consecutive packets being destined to the same host. Now
      can you refine your algorithm ?
  A). use cache for recently referenced addresses.

  G). what is a static variable in C ?
  A). usual stuff.

  G). what happens if you say that a global variable is static ?
  A). scope of global variable is limited to that source file only.

  NP). what all companies have you applied for ?

  NP). What you do as a reading room secretary ?

  NP). any questions from your side ?
  A). No,

  G & NP). thank you Mr. pvn.

  A). thank you


here is an interesting question which i faced in motorola interview.

   Q). suppose you have a string of 'm' 0's followed by n 1's. m is finite,
       while n is infinite, i.e. you don't know the length of the string.
       Now, tell me how do you find the number 'm' in minimum amount of time ?
   A). Think your self.
