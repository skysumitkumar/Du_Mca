Hello gupta,
these are the questions given from tcs paper
dont answer all questions.

In reasoning test at the end of each question we indicated
F,T,C
where F represents    False
"     T   "           True
"     C    "           cant say.

after this psychmetry test will be there.dont bother about it it is just
formal.they will not consider it.But answer all 150 questions in 30 
minutes


All the best
