SECTION III - ANALYSIS PROGRAM SEGMENTS
---------------------------------------

1) Here is the structure declaration of a doubly linked list

struct dlinnk {
int nodeid;
struct dlink *next;
struct dlink *prev;
} dlink_t;

A pointer of the head of the linked list is maintained as a global
variable,
whose definition is
dlink_t *head;

The funtion remove_element(dlink_t *rp), needs to remove the node
pointed to
the rp and adjust the head.

The first node's prev and the last node's next are NULL.

remove_element(dlink_t *rp)
{
rp->prev->next = rp->next;
rp->next->prev = rp->prev;
if( head == rp)
head = rp->next;

Which of the following statement is true about the fution
remove_element

A) It work when head is the same as rp
B) It does not work when rp is the last element on the list
c) It sets the head of the list correctly
D) It works in all cases

Answer :B) It does...

2) Consider the following function written in c:

#define NULL 0

char *
index(sp,c)
register char *sp,c;
{
do {
if(*sp == c)
return (sp);
} while (*sp++);
return NULL;
}

The first argument sp, is a pointer to a C string. The second
argument, c, is a character. This function scarches for the character
c, in the string. If it is found a pointer to that location is
returned
else NULL is returned.
This function works
a) Always
b) Always, but fails when the first byte contais the character c
c) works when c is a non NULL character only
d) Works only when the character c is found in the string
ans: a

while(*++dst = *++src);
}
ans:b

6) Consider the following program

main()
{
int i=20,*j=&i;

int *k;
{
*k +=15;
}

f2(x)
int *x;

}

The values printed by the program will be
a) 20 and 55
b) 20 and 45
c) 45 and 45
d) 45 and 55
e) 35 and 35
