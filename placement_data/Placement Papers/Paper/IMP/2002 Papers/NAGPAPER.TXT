hi 
this is the paper which we got from nagarro


there were two tests each of 1.5 h and having 50
questions each 
first paper was a  logical ability and basic maths test 
in the second test there were 50 questions from c , c++ data
structures
but beware the are changing the question paper from place to place

here are a few which i remember
1) which function doesnotdisplay chracteron screen
   ans getpass();

2)what happens if we include two times iostream.h
ans  error redeclaration

3)one question on complexity of finding the maximum in red&black , heap
ans) O(logn),O(1); 

1)cout<<(0==1)

2) what is encapsulation ---ans data hiding
3) which operator cann't be overloaded
a)||
b)++
/c)!!  ans
d)none of them

4) what is the o/p of the following program
float value(int t)
{
float i;
i=216.16+(0.555555*t);
return(i);
}

where t=464
ans 1)513.26


5)class a can access the data of class b if ///check
*******
a)a is friend of b
b)b is friend of a
c)both a and b
d)none of them

6)what is the o/p of this program
value(int i)
{
i*=i;
}
value1(int *t)
{
*t*=*t;
}

void main()
{
int i=16,j=19;
value(i);
value(&j);
cout<<i<<' '<<j;
}

7) main()
{
union{
int i;
char c;
}n;
n.i=557;
cout<<n.c;
}

8) study bitt wise operator care fully there were three
buestions 


12) given n alphabets max possible combinations can be
///******
made using..
a)stack
b)que
3)heap
d)all of above.
Ans. Stack
13)

#define x 10
#define x 30
main()
{
printf("\n %d",x);
} tell output
Ans. 30

14) int a[6]={1,2,3,4,5,6};
int *p=&a;
to access 3rd element what expression would u use
Ans. *( p+2)

15)for complex oprogram which is better switch-case or
if.
16)if an operator overloadng  function is not a memeber funtion then how
many argument 
is required
a)1 more
b)only 1
c) same
d) none

17) inheritance uses ///**************
a)generic polymorphisum
b)paramteric polymorphisum
c)derivrd polymorphisum
d)all of above


18)main()
{
int *p;
p=&a;
p+=10;
}
p will point to the random memory if a if of______
type.

19)which data structure is used for tower of hanoi
bridge..///*******
a)stack
b) heap
c)queqe
d)none of them

20)main()
{
int i=2;
float j=2;
while(i==j==1)
cout<<"hi";
}

study the concept of oprator overloading and
inheritance 
well....here the above writtn question are not written
exactly but 
i have written
only the logic or what ever i knows


do friend funcs increase efficiency of c++ prgs.
Ans. yes
6) question on red-black tree,2/3
tree,sclay-trees.///*********** 

7) given n alphabets max possible combinations can be
made using..
a)stack
b)que
3)heap
d)all of above.
Ans. Stack
8) one ques on operator overloading was ticklish.
9) int a[6]={1,2,3,4,5,6};
int *p=&a;
to access 3rd element what expression would u use
Ans. *( p+2)

10) one ques onHEAPsaying if root element is deleted
the resultant HEAP would consist of which series...

11) derived class is used in which concept
a)encapsulation
b)inheritance
c)ADTs
Ans. b
12) one ques on global and local variables was easy
types...
13)
#define x 10
#define x 30
main()
{
printf("\n %d",x);
} tell output
Ans. 30

14) two ques on recursion one of them reading
f(x,d);
r=d*f(x--,d)*f(x--,d)

will the both functions gets called or only one.
Ans. First only infinitely.

15) which of the express is wrong
a) int &p=n++
b)int *p,*u;
*p=*u;
c) int ***p=a;
Ans. (A)

16). output

if(d%2 = 0 )
some code
else
some code

Ans. Error


*** date date::fun(date & d)
{
 *******some code***
 return ????
}

a)this
b)*this  ans
c)none


***** f(x,y)
	{ if(x==0) || (y==1) || (y==x) return 1;
	  else return f(x-1,y) + f(x-1,y-1)
	}
	find f(10,9);
ans : 10


*******if we remove #ifndef _iostream  from iostream .h and then use #include<iosteam.h> twice  
in a program what is the output

ans : error redclaration of ios


*******
char temp='a';
main()
{
 	char temp=temp;
	cout<<temp;
}

what is the output

ans : undefined ( not error)


********
char x;
main()
{
int x
{
int *x=3;
cout<<sizeof(*x);
}
}
output??

ans : cannot convert * to int

*******

in which datastructure a search on a key brings that key at the root

ans : splay tree

********

which data struct will u associate with a magnetic tape
a) list
b)tree
c)stack

****************
order to find max (set,s) if implemented as red blsck tree / heap ?

a) n/n
b)lgn / 1
.........so on



difference b/w allocmem and maloc

**********
destructors cannot be overloaded ( this was the correct option out of four)

*******
constrctors are nonstatic members

**********
which function can be used to input a string from the keyboard ithout displatying the chars on
the keyboard
ans ; getpass()

**************
height of comnplete binary tree???


***********************8
the logical paper is consist of 50 questions and
having the 
duration of 1.5h.
few of thems are
study the notes of SANMACS properly related to
a)ratio proportion
b)logical of kind a->b
c)family relation.
few of them are
1)3 men or 7 women can do a piece of work in 32 days.
then how many days are required to compte the twice of
the work by 
7men and women.

2)if a person brought oranges of Rs 1.60 at the rate
of Rs 9 and thn sell it to Rs 2 at the rate
of 11.,what is his profit.

a)40 paisa...remaining three are having some result
in %.

out of these 50,25 are from matematics and 25 from the
logic 
describe above.
for matematics study the mansuration of class
tengh...althoug all 
the formula's wer in paper.

paper is very simple and have ample time to solve this
