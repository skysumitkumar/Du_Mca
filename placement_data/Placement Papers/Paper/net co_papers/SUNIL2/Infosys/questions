	 Correct the sentence questions 4.

	8 figures are there. Among these for 4 problems you have to find
	the next figure. for remaing  you have find odd figure.(ALL ARE 
	EASY )

	ONE ANALYTICAL QUESTION AS FOLLOWS (THIS ALSO VERY EASY)

five people in a family named A,B,C,D,E.
probable answers confirm by reading the question carefully.
ans: A,B -sons
doctor C -daughter
officer D - daughter in law  ie. wife of B

using this you have to solve five questions. that is very easy
if you confirm the above. 

ie.  don't confuse with the sentance who learns music. he clearly 
mension that daughter in law is offcier. he also mension that A is 
brother in law of officer. And C is a doctor.
