SECTION III - ANALYSIS PROGRAM SEGMENTS
---------------------------------------

1) Here is the structure declaration of a doubly
linked list

struct dlink {
int nodeid;
struct dlink *next;
struct dlink *prev;
} dlink_t;

A pointer of the head of the linked list is maintained
as a global variable,
whose definition is
dlink_t *head;

The funtion remove_element(dlink_t *rp), needs to
remove the node pointed to
the rp and adjust the head.

The first node's prev and the last node's next are
NULL.

remove_element(dlink_t *rp)
{
rp->prev->next = rp->next;
rp->next->prev = rp->prev;
if( head == rp)
head = rp->next;

Which of the following statement is true about the
function remove_element

A) It work when head is the same as rp
B) It does not work when rp is the last element on the
list
c) It sets the head of the list correctly
D) It works in all cases

Answer :B

2) Consider the following function written in c:

#define NULL 0

char *
index(sp,c)
register char *sp,c;
{
do {
if(*sp == c)
return (sp);
} while (*sp++);
return NULL;
}

The first argument sp, is a pointer to a C string. The
second
argument, c, is a character. This function scarches
for the character
c, in the string. If it is found a pointer to that
location is returned 
else NULL is returned.
This function works
a) Always
b) Always, but fails when the first byte contais the
character c
c) works when c is a non NULL character only
d) Works only when the character c is found in the
string

SECTION III - ANALYSIS PROGRAM SEGMENTS
---------------------------------------

1) Here is the structure declaration of a doubly
linked list

struct dlink {
int nodeid;
struct dlink *next;
struct dlink *prev;
} dlink_t;

A pointer of the head of the linked list is maintained
as a global variable,
whose definition is
dlink_t *head;

The funtion remove_element(dlink_t *rp), needs to
remove the node pointed to
the rp and adjust the head.

The first node's prev and the last node's next are
NULL.

remove_element(dlink_t *rp)
{
rp->prev->next = rp->next;
rp->next->prev = rp->prev;
if( head == rp)
head = rp->next;

Which of the following statement is true about the
function remove_element

A) It work when head is the same as rp
B) It does not work when rp is the last element on the
list
c) It sets the head of the list correctly
D) It works in all cases

Answer :B

2) Consider the following function written in c:

#define NULL 0

char *
index(sp,c)
register char *sp,c;

return (sp);
} while (*sp++);
return NULL;
}

The first argument sp, is a pointer to a C string. The
second
argument, c, is a character. This function scarches
for the character
c, in the string. If it is found a pointer to that
location is returned
else NULL is returned.
This function works
a) Always
b) Always, but fails when the first byte contais the
character c
c) works when c is a non NULL character only
d) Works only when the character c is found in the
string

Q.NO.1&2
A FACTORY produces a product (measured in cubic feet) over seven days 
as per 
the following schedule:

Day1    Day2    Day3    Day4    Day5    Day6    Day7

150    180    120    250    160    120    150


The finished goods are to be transported to the market by a truck 
having a 
capacity of 2000 cubic feet. Any finished goods (ready at the end of 
the 
day) retained overnight at the factory will incur a storage cost of 
rs.5 per 
cubic foot for each night of storage. The hiring cost for the truck is 
rs.1000 per day.

1.If the total cost of transportation and storage is to be minimized,

Modem speeds are in bits per second (14.4, 28.8 and 56 thousand bits  per  second are standard).  CD-ROM Drives - A CD-ROM drive is a high capacity storage device which lets you read  data  from the disk, but not write data back. The speed of the drive (how  fast the  CD platter spins) is measured in multiples from the first generation  drives.  New drives are up to 24X (or 24 times the first drives), but while the  CD  spins faster, it is not really 24 times faster in actual output.  Printers - There are different types of printers (laser, ink jet, dot matrix)  with  differing quality of output. They are measured in dpi (dots per inch)  and  ppm (pages per minute), the higher
