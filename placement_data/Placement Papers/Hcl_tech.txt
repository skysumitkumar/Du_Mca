HCL CONSULTANCY LIMITED
    There are two cateagiries : Technologies and Application
    For Technologies there are four sections :
    a) Computer awareness  (15) b) C programs          (20)
    c) Analysis of Program (10) d) Analytical Problems (20)

    For Application All questions are Analytical only (Verbal & 
Q.A)
    Pre-requisite  : Sound knowledge in C and little of C++
    For Interviews : C,C++,Networking(layers,TCP/IP,SPX/IPX) & 
Data Structure
         in both Application and Technoligies division.  Also they 
are asking
         questions from the question paper(technoligies) in which 
the
         candidate had commited mistakes or left out

    Note : Refer Programming in ANSI C by Kernignan & Ritche : 
some c question
           where taken from it.  Also when asked about which book 
you are
           following, don't say Let Us C by Kanitkar, atleast say 
some really
           good books like Prog. in ANSI C, Sprit of C etc;

Six knights - P,Q,R,S,T and U - assemble for a long journey in 
two
travelling parties. For security, each travelling party consists
of at least two knights. The two parties travel by separate 
routes,
northern and southern. After one month, the routes of the 
northern
and southern groups converge for a brief time and at that point 
the
knights can, if they wish, rearrange their travelling parties 
before
continuing, again in two parties along separate northern and 
southern
routes. Throughout the entire trip, the composition of 
travelling
parties must be in accord with the following conditions

other
knights and travels by the northern route, the other memnbers of 
this party
besides U must be

c) Q and R
d) Q and T
e) R and T
