    <em>Typical question is:<br>
    </em>You are a project manager of a big multinational project.There is a person X,
    assigned to you who has the best&nbsp; technical skills required for the project,even
    better than you.But he wishes to be the project manager ,which the management does not
    permit,due to which he threatens to quit.All others in the group are not as competent.Talk
    yourself out of this situation pretending that the interviewer is the disgruntled employee
    and explain the neceessary action.<br>
    <br>
    For the technical section questions the engg. textbooks would suffice.For a detailed list
    of authors and other improtant tips check our <a href="../Intsec.htm">interview section.</a></li>

    </font></strong><font size="3">IBM strives to lead in the creation, development and
    manufacture of the industry's most advanced information technologies, including <strong>computer
    systems, software, networking systems, storage devices and microelectronics.</strong>IBM
    brings its products and services&nbsp; through IBM India and IBM Global Services.<br>
    <br>
    IBM India's product portfolio includes the IBM PC, Aptiva home computer , ThinkPad
    portables, RS/6000, AS/400e, S/390 and Netfinity servers, network computers, printers,
    networking and storage products. IBM's software offerings include DB2, Lotus, Tivoli, MQ
    Series and a range of Internet software like WebSphere and SecureWay.<br>
    <br>
    India is also home to <strong>two select IBM centers</strong> - the <strong>IBM Solutions
    Research Center</strong> at <strong>New Delhi</strong> and the <strong>Solutions
    Partnership Center (SPC) </strong>at <strong>Bangalore</strong>. The SRC (only the eighth

<p><font size="3">The current pay package is around Rs. <strong>20,000</strong>. IBM is on
spree of increasing its male/female ratio in its workforce
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hence female candidates are
being given a slight advantage over their male counterparts.<br>
