Sell Yourself
When you are out on a job hunt, you have to be prepared to sell your skills to a potential employer. 

Apart form your resume which gives a prospective employer an idea of your achievements, the interview really counts. For, that is where you, your personality is reflected. 

Selling your talents without seeming like empty boasting or worse, trumpeting your achievements, is no mean task. 

Here's what experts tell you to do:Resume - tailor your resume to suit the job on hand. Organize and table its contents to reflect the talents that you have that are required for that particular job.

Personality - how you look is as important as what you say. First impressions do last. Be presentable. Dress smartly, talk politely. Do not get overheated or shout. Remember, an interviewer also assesses how you will react in stressful circumstances.

Homework - understand the philosophy of the organization you are approaching for a job, its goals, its work culture, its requirements. Ask if necessary, but learn.

Honesty and Example - combine the truth with a compelling argument. If there is something you do not know, say so but mitigate the damage by quoting instances where you learnt something that you didn't know and emphasize the things that you do know

Highlight - areas that are your specialty should be highlighted. Do not overdo it though. Emphasize your talents and achievements only if they are relevant.
