NOTE:::::

I'm sendin the questions, somany have no answers. U do check the
answers  for all the given questions also.

All questions are MULTIPLE CHOICES ONLY.

U do try to cover the related topics to get some understanding.
In interview They are asking C C++ Operating system concepts
and Networks.
They will ask about Ur interesting subjects, U try to have good
grip on those intresting subjects.

They selected 11 out of 55 students.
I'm 7th.
I did interview very well, They asked about c c++ project work and
operating systems, I answered well,
But they selected only 2 , one from CS and another is BTech ECE.
I lost it.
Ur project is concerned with TCP/IP so U R having fair chance to get
this NOVELL
Don't worry, prepare well, get it, All the best.


section 1::::;

*. GRE book test paper 3 section 5
question no. 8 to 12     (ships WXYZ starting on dec. 23rd..........)


* 5 programs are sheduled from monday to saterday, monday is not holiday,
PQRST are the programs. Theday before P is holiday, and some other clues are
given, we have to find the sequence (4 questions)

ANS: tuesday is the holiday
     P comes on wednesday ,
     U can do the remaining very easily.
* Suppose U R the presoner, There are two guards Who will tell truth or
one will tell truth. There is a gate for liberty and another foe hell.

Some questions are given, like
    i. are U tell truth?
    ii. another tell truth or not??
    iii. both of U R telling truth??
    iV. both of U lieing??
    V. --------------


    they gave  a. b. c. d. and asking about which sequencing is sufficient to
    find the gate for liberty??
    ( I can't give exact thing)
 
* There are WIFE and HUSBAND at one side of river. They have one child,
They want to cross the river. The child can't be lonly. The boat boy won't
permit morethan one to cross the river, what is the correct way to
cross the river??

* There are 7  targets, A B and C has to shoot them. All should be shooted 
consicutively.
    1. The no. of chances for A and B are not less thn 2,
    2. for C there is only one chance.
    3. A can't shot 3 times consicutively.
    4. B is permited to shoot in even chances only.

    They have given some 3or 4 questions on this

* 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
section 2:  Buchi's typing.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
section 3::

1.Max value of SIGNED int 
    a. b. c. d.
2.One questin is given, long one, to find the answer U should be 
femiliar
 with the operation as follows

 int *num={10,1,5,22,90};
 main()
 {
 int *p,*q;
  int i;
  p=num;
  q=num+2;
  i=*p++;
  print the value of i, and q-p, and some other operations are there.
  }
  how the values will change??
3. One pointer diff is given like this:
  int *(*p[10])(char *, char*)
  asked to find the    meaning.
4. char *a[4]={"jaya","mahe","chandra","buchi"};
   what is the value of    sizeof(a)/sizeof(char *)
   a. 4 b.bytes for char c-- d.--
( we don't know the answer)

5. void fn(int *a, int *b)
   {
    int *t;
    t=a;
    a=b;
    b=t;
    }

    {
     int a=2;
     int b=3;
     fn(&a,&b);
     print the values os a and b;
     }
     what is the output--- out put won't swap, the same values remain.

     a. error at runtime
     b. compilation error
     c.2 3
     d. 3 2
6. 
#define scanf "%s is a string"
main()
{
 printf(scanf,scanf);
 }
 what is the output.

 ANS : %s is string is string

7. i=2+3,4>3,1;
   printf("%d"i);

   ans is 5 only.
8. char *p="abc";
   char *q="abc123";

   while(*p=*q)
   {
    print("%c %c",*p,*q);
    }

    a. aabbcc
    b. aabbcc123
    c. abcabc123
    d. infinate loop ( this may be correct)
9. printf("%u",-1)
what is the value?
a. -1 b. 1 c. 65336 d.  --


(maxint value-1   I think, check for the answer)

10. #define void int
    int i=300;
   void  main(void)
    {
     int i=200;
     {
      int i=100;
      print the value of i;
      }
      print the value of i
      }
      what is the output?


      may be 100 200
11.

   int x=2;
   x=x<<2;
   printf("%d ",x);


   ANS=8;
12.
     
int a[]={0,0X4,4,9};     /*some values are given*/

int i=2;

printf("%d %d",a[i],i[a]);

 what is the value???   (may be error)

 13.
     some other program is given , I can't remember it
     U can get it afterwads,

     the answer is 3 3, so U can check this in the exam. itself.

     I'll send the remaining two afterwars whenever I get them. OK !

I got this from one of the research scholars.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
One person from Uttar Pradesh (UP) was in Mysore forabout4 years and his
wife was in Jaunpur (UP).  At the end of 4 years he distributed sweets
to his colleages in office stating that his wife has delivered a Son.
His colleagues were quite shocked and they asked how this happened when
our friend was in Mysore and his wife in Jaunpur. He said it is common
in UP that neighbours take care of the wife (good Samaritans) when he is
at Mysore.

The colleagues asked him what name he would give to the son to which he
replied "If the second  neighbour from his house in Jaunpur is involved
then the name would be DWIVEDI, if it is the third neighbour then
it would be TRIVEDI, if it is the fourth neighbour then it would be
CHATURVEDI and if it is a mixture of all the three then it would be
named as MISHRA and if the wife feels shy to tell the name of the person 
involved then the name of the child would be SHARMA and if she refuses to 
divulge the name of the person involved then the name of the child would be
GUPTA. If she does not remember then it is YADAV ,if she becomes Red
faced on asking this then it is REDDY.If she is too enthusiastic 'bout
it then it is JOSHI.

mile to west, then 1/8 mile to south and so  on  making  a  loop. 
Finally hoe far he is from his camp and in which direction.
ans: in north and south directions 
   1/2 - 1/8 + 1/32 - 1/128 + 1/512 - and so on 
                = 1/2/((1-(-1/4))
      similarly in east and west directions
     1- 1/4 + 1/16 - 1/64 + 1/256 -    and so on 
             = 1/(( 1- ( - 1/4))

.  If you sum their ages . it is exactly same as  my  neighbour's 
door number on my left. The  sacond  mathematiciaan  verfies  the 
door number and says that the not sufficient  .  Then  the  first 
says " o.k one more clue is that my youngest is the youngest"
Immmediately the second mathematician answers . Can  you  aanswer

THIS FILE CONTAINS THE QUESTIONS WHICH MS SCHOLARS FACED IN PLACEMENT
                   INTERVIEWS IN 1994 AND 1995



Name: Biswajit Sain

for(int i = 1; i <= 1; i++)
{
	Company name: Wipro Infotech Ltd., Bangalore.
	Year: 1995

Wipinfo has 2 rounds of interviews. The first round is fully technical.
The second round, depending on the members of the board, may be
technical,
semi-technical or personal. Last year the second round was more
technical than the first(!) and the board was headed by Mr. P.V.Sanjeeva
Reddy, one of the no-nonsense, hardcore-technical, project leaders
in Infotech. This year it was headed by Mr. Victor Jayakiran, G.M.
(Technical, Global R&D) who was a much sober man and therefore spent
most of the time in the second round dealing with personal questions.

I detail here the technical questions asked in the first round --
--------------------------------------------------------------

[1] Tell us about your work in brief.
My Ans. Mention first the title, followed by a brief overview of the
work, what we plan to achieve, what has been achieved so far, finally
the relevance/scope of the work to the related area (i.e. how is it
going to be useful).	[ 5-10 mins. depending on interest of the
listener.]

[2..n] Questions related to the work.
Ans. Area dependent. [ ~ 10 mins ]

[n+1] Tell us what you know about DMA and why that is needed?
My Ans. As usual, mentioned the wastage of CPU computation power spent
in busy-waiting. Told how DMA works.

[n+2] What are the various types of scheduling algo, what is used by
UNIX?
My Ans. Mentioned Round Robin, First-come-first-served,
Shortest-job-first, Earliest-deadline-first, Least-laxity-first,
Priority-based-event-driven. UNIX uses RR with multi-level feedback.

[n+3] How can you implement SJF in UNIX?
My Ans. Usually, SJF means that we know the job-duration in advance. In
UNIX where we cannot know that, we have to make assumptions about that
based on which we should initially schedule. Periodically however, we
have to fine-tune our initial assumptions based on the times taken by
various ready jobs, and recompute estimates and change the schedule
accordingly.

[n+4] Different types of subroutine calling conventions?
My Ans. Call by value, reference, value-result.

[n+5] Parameter passing sequence used by C?
My Ans. Rightmost parameter pushed first on stack.

[n+6] What is a page-fault and how is it handled in UNIX?
My Ans. [Refer to MJBach, Ch. 9 for details].

Personal questions in the first round --
-------------------------------------

1. What was your overall position in the Univ. in B.E.
2. Why did you choose to join MS here.
3. How do you like the MS course.
4. Anything you want to know about us.

Technical Questions in the second round --
---------------------------------------

[1] What are the current trends and areas of focus in IT.
My Ans. Talked about emerging trends of S/W Engg and ISO 9000 stuff
(gave vague ideas about them as I don't know much nor do I care 
about these topics myself ;-)). Then mentioned the proliferation of O-O
methodologies and their usefulness in speeding up development process,
code re-usability, ease of maintenance, ease of bug-fixing.
Thirdly, mentioned the work going on in High-Speed N/w - FDDI, ATM,
Fast-Ethernet(100Mbps). Told whatever little I knew about ATM in
response to another question.

[2] What is a Micro-Kernel architecture.
My Ans. This is a developing area in OSs where  instead of building the
kernel as a single monolithic structure starting from scratch, it is
built as a set of layers. The micro-kernel provides only the bare-bones
like Device-drivers, rudimentary filesystem support etc. on which,
depending on the intended area of application of the OS, it can be
customized to provide various higher level OS features like
Multiprocessing, IPC, etc. 

Personal Questions in the second round --
--------------------------------------

1. Tell us about yourself, your background.
2. What does your father do currently.
3. Your performance in schooling, B.E.
4. Your +/- points.
5. Why do you think Wipro should take you.
6. What qualities do you have that make you a person suitable for going
into the IT industry (a corollary to the previous question).
7. What do your friends opine about you.
8. When do you think you will complete and be able to join.
9. How can you assure that you will join by that time.
10. Anything you want to know about us.

Name: G.Kartik
Year: 1995

Company name: Wipro Infotech

   FIRST INTERVIEW:(First the interviewer asked me to name two 
                    favorite subjects - OS and Networks)
   a) Describe the memory management policies in Unix. How is paging
      implemented? How page faults are handled? 
      Seems to be a favorite question for these chaps ---- Maurice Bach. 
   
   b) Write a macro in C for swapping two nibbles in a byte.
      -Use the shift operators and be careful while defining temporary 
      variables( if you do so) as you have to write a macro. Otherwise
      it is pretty simple.

   c) What is the CPU-scheduling policy in Unix? - Round robin scheduling
      with multilevel queues.

   d) Diffrence between short term, long term and medium term scheduler.
      -First two should be peaceful. The last one is also known as 
       swapper. (See Taenenbaum and/or Peterson)

   e) Name various page-replacement policies. Which can be implemented
      both with and without pre-emption? - see Peterson.

   f) Describe the Sliding window protocol. What is it's advantage
      over stop-and-wait? - Saves bandwidth. (Taenenbaum please)


   2ND INTERVIEW (Both personal and technical interleaved)
   a) Tell us something about yourself.
   b) Aren't you going for higher studies abroad? Why?
   c) Rank and CGPA. MSites do not have ranks but still they wanted to
      know my approx position in my batch. 
      - Shady question. It is your job to convince them that for
      MS, grades do not hold any meaning.

   d) What is re-entrant code? --- Non-self modifying code. Can be 
      shared by many processes simultaneously. Gave e.g. of text-editors
      like 'vi'.
      Counter Q: But then no code modifies itself. What does 'non-self 
      modifying' mean? ---- I don't know for sure.

   e) Diff between compilers and interpreters. Some fundaes about
      how to link code in  different files. 

   f) What would your friends tell us about you if we ask them?
      Standard question for everyone.



Company: Motorola (came in August'95)
Just one question: When do you expect to finish? ---By August'96
                   That is too late. We are looking for guys who
                   finish by Jan'96. Pl. apply a month before you 
                   submit your thesis. Thank you very much.


Company: HCL-HP
Written test:
One GRE type anals. section, and two comp Sc. sections. One Comp Sc. 
section was problem solving type. Quite easy. Only question worth mentioning
in it was:
    You are given a stack on which you can do the following:

    Push X ----push the contents of memory location X on the stack
    Pop X  ----pop the contents of top of stack into mem. loc X
    AND    ----pop top two elements of stack, AND them and push the
               result onto stack.
    NOR    ----pop top two elements, NOR them and push the result onto stack.

Given two data elements at memory locations A and B, obtain A XOR B using 
the above.

First Interview:- mostly technical.

	a) Asked about my B.E. and why I joined MS.

	b) My preference of posting. They asked this initially before
	   launching into any other questions. I told them Madras.
	   Remainder of the interview was mostly on OS and C. Nothing
	   on networks. Thus I have this inkling that they frame their 
	   questions on the basis of what you specify as your preference 
	   of posting and  depending on what projects are available there.

	c) What architectures, apart from 8085, do you know? --- Nothing 
	   very deep and I told them as much.

	d) Give the contents of process stack for the execution of 
	   a particular C-program they give. 
	   ------ The C-program as such is not important. You just have 
	   to remember the order in which the return address of any 
	   function/procedure call, the parameters, and the local variables
	   are stored on the stack. 
	   ( I guess, any CO book should have this. Maurice Bach talks 
	   about user and kernel stacks)

	e) What all are shared by parent and child processes immediately
	   after parent executes a fork system call? Cross questioned
	   about the 'copy on write' facility and 'dup' system call. 
	   --- again see MB, and also Stevens' 2nd chapter.

	f) What events happen when the following command is given?
		cat /etc/passwd | more 

	   ---- Describe how the shell forks the two processes and how
		the pipe gets created between them. 
	  Cross question: How does 'cat' know that its output has to be 
	                  written into the pipe and not into standard o/p?
			  

	g) Have you written any TSR's? --- No.
	   What are TSR? ----Terminate but stay resident programs.
	   Then does it mean DOS is a multitasking system? 
	   ---- No, TSRs are interrupt driven

	h) How are Windows programs different from normal C-programs?
	   ---- Windows programs are event driven.
	   What can be the various types of events? --- See Primer/API bible.

	i) Difference between swapping and paging. 
	   ---- Swapping is moving entire processes between main memory
	   and hard disk. Paging is moving individual pages of a process.
	   
	j) Write a program to list all palindromes in a string.
	   ----- Hint: use a stack and some extra storage for remembering
	   previous palindromes.

	k) What's the outout?

		char *cp;
		int *ip;

		cp=(char *)0x100;
		ip=(int *)cp;

		ip++;
		cp++;
		printf("cp = %x ip = %x", cp, ip);

		Ans:cp = 0x101 ip = 0x102 ...(why?)

	l) What are static variables and functions? There are two files,
	   say, file1 and file2. file1 has a global declaration
			static int x;
	  file2 has a global declaration
			int y;
	  What is the difference between the two types of declarations
	  when you link file1 and file2? 
	  --- x is local to functions in file1 and cannot be seen by  
	      functions in file2. y can be seen by functions in both 
	      file1 and file2.

	m) How does a debugger set breakpoints in a code you are debugging?
	   ---- some funda regarding insertion if an interrupt instruction
	        in the code....don't know for sure.
	  (It seems that this q was also asked by some other company.
	   Worth knowing the answer.)

This was followed by a shady psychological test. You are given a 
set of six pictures. Look at each picture and write a story on each.

Second interview: (fully personal) --- This was more interesting;-)
	a) What did you feel about the ppt? --- wasn't very impressive
	  so gave some shady answer.
	b) Have you heard of creativity? -- Ya.
	   Have you heard of Bernard Shaw? -- Ya.
	   (Then he rattled off some quote of BS regarding creativity)
	   What do you say? --- I put some shadiest fundaes regarding
	   visionaries and Leonardo da Vinci conceptualising Helicopters
	   in his time!

**********************************************************************

U.V.Ravindra - D.J.Ram's student. Passed out in Jan '95.
**********************************************************************

The first thing any IIT-ian should realize while attending Campus
Interviews is that the Companies have come to take you, and that
*you* are not looking for a job.  I refer to the attitude of the mind.
Therefore, there's no need to treat it as a life and death issue.  In
my opinion, several students take this matter as a very serious career
issue, and think that if they don't get a job in the campus
interviews, they are sunk.  This is not true.  A good case in point
will be Sudhakar's, who didn't get any job that he wanted in the
Campus Interviews, but when he came to Bangalore and applied to the
different companies, he landed a job in *every* company he applied
for.  And these companies were by no means insignificant ones: Tata
Elxsi, Wipro Infotech, Novell, C-DAC ... all those which are
considered to be respectable employers.  So, the catch phrase during
Campus Interviews is, "don't panic, be cool, relax, you have *nothing*
to lose, and everything to gain."  This is the attitude you should
have in mind when you go for the interviews.

About the companies, now.  There are mainly two kinds of companies in
Bangalore.  Those that are small, like Tata Elxsi and Novell, with a
more or less flat organizational structure, and those that are very
huge, like Wipro and TISL, where there's a veritable population
explosion.  There are merits and demerits of both.  In the small
organizations, there are fewer people, so it is easy to make your
presence felt and to make yourself noticed, and to get proper credit
for what you are doing.  The flip side of the coin for these
organizations is that you have to be very careful in what you say and
do, for everything you do/say is audible at the highest levels, and,
as the American Police say when they are arresting a criminal
"anything you say may be used against you."  Smaller organizations
also have a flatter structure, so the amount of responsibility on your
shoulders may be quite heavy.  In one sense it is good -- you can
contribute well to the organization and get credit for it, but in
another sense it is bad, for you may have to work late and quite hard
too.  The advantages of being in a large organization like Wipro is
that you will never be *overloaded* with work, unless you choose to do
so yourself.  You can be in the company as you are in the CS
Department right now, light-headed and carefree, even a bit careless.
The obverse side of the coin here is that in such huge organizations,
you will never be anything but small fry in a big pond ... and getting
credit where it is due may be a little difficult (specific reference
to TISL here).

Another issue that should be considered when seriously aiming at a
company is the nature of the job that you will be put in.  In my
honest opinion, since the pay structures of most companies are
verisimilar now, and the salary differential between employees of
different companies is very minimal, the nature of work is the most
important criterion that one should pay attention to.  If you are
