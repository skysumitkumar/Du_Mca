 RETROFITTING OF ALU - 411 ENGINE ON D50-A BULL-DOZER
=======================================================
 INTRODUCTION :

      I have retrofitted Ashok Leyland  make  ALU-411  engine  on
BEML D50- A Bull-Dozer.D50-A  Bull-Dozer  is  originally   fitted
with KOMATSU (Japan) Engine,As Komatsu Spare Parts are  Expensive
and it  has solved the spare parts problem , it has not attracted
customers as Maintenance repairal spare parts cost are very high.,

     A.P.State  Agros  Corporation  in  Hyderabad is  having   32
BullDozers   in   Andhra   Pradesh   which   are   fitted    with
KOMATSU/CUMMINS Engines. They are facing lot of problems in Main-
tening  KOMATSU/  CUMMINS  Engines   as  they  are costlier. They
thought that if Ashok Leyland Engine  can  be  fitted  on  D50  A
BullDozer  it  will  solve  all of their problems as maintenance,
repair,  spare  parts  cost  are  cheaper  when   compared   with
KOMATSU/CUMMINS  Engines.  They have approached M/s EVEREST Motor
Works , Hyderabad.  who are authorised dealers for Ashok  Leyland
Industrial  Engines in Telangana and Rayalseema Regions.  At that
time I have been working as Service Engineer in M/s Everest Motor
Works,  Hyd.  Our M. D gave a word to M/s AP Agros Corpo. for Re-
trofitting of Ashok Leyland Engine on their BullDozer.   Our  M.D
gave this Assignment project work.

     I have selected  ALU 411 Engione as its H.P. and Torque  are
almost  equal  to  that  of  KOMATSU  Engines.With in a span of 3
months I  have  completed  this  project  work  and  tested  this
BullDozer  in  field.   Mr.  Sankar  Subramanian Manager, Product
development, and Mr. Lobo  from AshokLeyland Company has inspect-
ed  the  performance of this prototype engine in field.  Till now
it has run for 700 hrs.  successfully in field without any  prob-
lem.  M/s A.P. Agros State Corporation is felt very happy as this
project has become successful.

     Now they are ready to replace all of  their  KOMATSU/CUMMINS
Engines  with Ashok Leyland Engines commercially hundreds of D50A
BullDozers fitted with Komatsu Engines are available  in   India,
and  if  we  improve  this prototype engine We can save crores of
Foreign exchange to our country and it  is  also  profit  to  our
Ashok  Leyland Company. I have spend nearly Rs. 50,000/- for mak-
ing spare parts kit. Major part of this amount  is  utilised  for
making  patterns  (Teak) From 2nd kit onwards we can make the kit
for Rs. 30,000 as pattern cost is not there.
