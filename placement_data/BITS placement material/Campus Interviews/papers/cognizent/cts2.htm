<P align=left><STRONG>This is only a sample paper. We are not providing you with

pattern.</STRONG></P>
<P align=left><BR><STRONG>SECTION I </STRONG>- <EM>8 questions based on 
series.</EM><BR><BR>1. These questions involve interchange of letters in a word 
at particular locations and also interchanging letters adjacent to those 
particular locations.Certain other conditions may also be given<BR>For 
eg.<BR>Let the word be ABBAABA<BR>If we apply 25 on this, it means we have to 
interchange the letters at positions 2 and 5, also we have to change the letters 
adjacent to positions 2 and 5 i.e.from A to B and B to A. <BR>A B B A A B after 
Step 1 i.e interchange of 2 and 5 becomes AABABB<BR>Now change adjacent elements 
of 2 and 5...finally answer becomes<BR>Ans: B A A B B A<BR><BR><EM>Questions 1-5 
are based on the pattern with changed numbers as described above</EM></P>
<P align=left><EM>Questions 6-8 are of the following type</EM></P>
<P align=left>To get AAABBD from BBBAAA what number should be applied:-<BR>a) 25 
<BR>b) 34 <BR>c) 25 &amp; 34 <BR>d) none</P>
<P align=left><BR><STRONG>SECTION II<BR></STRONG><BR>1. Given the following 
functions<BR>(1) f(n a b c ) = ac if n=1<BR>(2) f(n a b c) = f( n-1 a c b) + f( 
1 a b c) + f( n-1 b a c ) if n &gt; 1<BR>&nbsp; <BR>Then what is the 
value&nbsp;&nbsp; f( 2 a b c ) = ?<BR><BR><FONT color=#800000>Ans: f( 2 a c b ) 
= ab + ac + bc</FONT>.</P>
<P align=left><BR>2. Similar question on functions.</P>
<P align=left><BR>3. <EM>[ Based on the function in the first question]</EM> For 
the function f( 4 a b c ) the number of terms is...?<BR><EM>Hint</EM> f( 4 a b c 
) = f( 3 a c b ) + f( 1 a b c ) + f( 3 b a c ) etc.<BR><BR><BR>4. What is the 
value of the function&nbsp; f( 5 a b c ) = ?</P>
<P align=left><BR><STRONG>SECTION III</STRONG><BR><BR>Permutations and 
Combinations.<BR>8 Questions.<BR><BR>1. r = number of flags;n = number of 
poles;<BR>Any number of flags can be accommodated on any single pole.<BR><BR>1) 
r=5,n=5 The no. of ways the flags can be arranged ?<BR><BR>Questions 2-5 are 
based on the above pattern</P>
<P align=left><BR>6. r = 5 n = 3 . If first pole has 2 flags, third pole has 1 
flag<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How many ways can the remaining be 
arranged?<BR><BR>Questions 7.&amp; 8. are similar to Question 6.</P>
<P align=left><BR><STRONG>SECTION IV</STRONG><BR><EM>Question consisting of 
figures - Pattern-matching type.</EM></P>
<P align=left>Refer R.S Agarwal's book on Analytical Reasoning &amp; TMHs
