Hi friends

here is the full paper of TI India IITB 20/07/2001.

 the paper had 4 sections in which we have to attend
 2 sections
 i attempted digtal and analog

and in apti, there was 75 Qs in 60min. be prepare for
it also, apti was very tough.

 1. nand gate is
  a) associative &cumulative b)cumulative but not
 associative
  c)not cumulative but associative d)not cumultive
 and associative

Ans. b
  
 2. which imp has les delay
 a)  (a xor b) xor (c xor d) 
 b) (((a xor b) xor c) xor d)
(think on the situation when input a, b, c, d are
comes in ascending (i.e. a frist then b then c and
then d) and desending (opposite order)

 3) one inverter cmos circuit was given with a
 variable as enable 
 signal
 ans. tristate inverter with b as enable
 
 4)a logic cell which dertermines(op =1) for odd no..
 of 1s in the 
 given seq is
 ans. one xor gate
 
 5)circuit
           --------   
           | ttl     q   
             logic |---+diode-

           ----------     
           
           led should glow when q=0 and off when q=1
           the choices are
           a.ckt will funct as given
           b.it wont funct as given
           c.q cant drive ttl inverter
           d.non of these
           
  6)n nets are givenin how many ways can wemodel each
 of the stuck at
  fault in n nets in single(one at a time) and w....
  ans.n and 2 pow n
  7) circiut with 2 d ffs was given 
     
        dff1 op(complement)
         as d1 ip (q1 bar)   |       |op of dff2(com)
                                      given as dff2ip
 
                                                 clk

                XOR
               DFF2 o\p (q2)
               
               whaT is the relation between b and
 clk?      
        
    8)3 dffs was given with common clk
    setup time 3ns
    hold time 1ns
    clk to q delay 2ns find the maximum frequency of
 operation
           
         9)fsm question
                  thre states given ques what is the
 machne called
                  
                 s1---------------
   if 0 same state   1 goes to s3               
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  s2<-------------s3    if 1 same
 state s3             
                        0                 
          if 1 same state s2        
                  
                  
                  
                  
  10. consider a adder and multiplier
  question ios some what like can both implemented in
 same fsm or cant  
                 
  these are the 10 ques asked in digitl section and
 we are in a 
 situation to attend 2 section i attented analog part
 and i am giving the ruogh idea of analog section

10. one Qs on current mirror. there are n current
mirrors are connected in series, you have to find out
the condition for whitch current mirrors will be in
linear region.
