 
stm paper for h/w eng 
 
it consists of 3 sections
all q's are objective
section 1:  10 q's
all are very simple questions each carry 1 mark
q's like 
ripple freq of a half wave rectifier for home applications  --- 50hz
what is more stable osc -- crystal
relation between flicker noise and freq
some transient ckt having only cap's with initial charges
a simple bjt relation
 
 i m  not able to remember other q's
 
section 2: 6 q's
this section is little bit tough
u should know the analog mos ckts basics
1)given an mos opamp ckt, folded cascode and we should find out the
inverting and non inverting i/ps of that op amp and to find out where
the compensation capacitor is to be connected
2)2 stage mos opamp and to find out the gain of that op amp
3)given a bjt diff amp with swamping resistors and to find out the
current through that resistor
4) one pamp application ckt -- easy
5)given a transfer fn. and phase margin findout the relation btw the 
poles
6)given a ADC relation and find out the error %
 
section 3: 6 q's
1) given a state machine and we had to finout the correct state table.
2)q. on flip flop timing
3)one q on microprocessor code its very easy
4) VHDL code is given and we had to findout what is the code
represents its also very easy
5)q on stack
 
sorry i m not able to remember the sixth q
 
in interview they asked only on basics of digital mos ckts 
 
all the best
bye
