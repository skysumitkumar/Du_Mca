3) one inverter cmos circuit was given with a variable as enable
signal
ans. tristate inverter with b as enable

4)a logic cell which dertermines(op =1) for odd no.. of 1s in the

fault in n nets in single(one at a time) and w....
ans.n and 2 pow n
7) circiut with 2 d ffs was given

        dff1 op(complement)
        as d1 ip (q1 bar)   |       |op of dff2(com)
                                     given as dff2ip
                                                clk
                            |   DFF1 |q1-------------->    DFF2---q2 b
               CLK -------->
               XOR
              DFF2 o\p (q2)

              whaT is the relation between b and clk?

   8)3 dffs was given with common clk
   setup time 3ns
   hold time 1ns
   clk to q delay 2ns find the maximum frequency of operation

        9)fsm question
                 thre states given ques what is the machne called

                s1---------------
  if 0 same state   1 goes to s3






                 s2<-------------s3    if 1 same state s3
                       0
         if 1 same state s2




10. consider a adder and multiplier
question ios some what like can both implemented in same fsm or cant

these are the 10 ques asked in digitl section and we are in a
situation to attend 2 section i attented analog part
and i am giving the ruogh idea of analog section


analog part 10questions
