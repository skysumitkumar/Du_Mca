These are few books that u can study for ur campus placements!
1. Puzzles to puzzle you.........Shakuntla Devi
2. More puzzles......................Shakuntla Devi
3. Puzzles & Teasers..............George J. Summers (buy this if u r thru SD)
4. Test your C skills.................Yashwant Kanetkar
5. Understanding pointers in C..Yashwant Kanetkar
and other C books which have small algos explained.

For more simple algos and tree or linked list based codes,check out a folder called 'crack'
inside questions/IMP_INTE.
Also i saved few puzzle htmls in folder 2007. You can also review interview questions 
from geekinterview.com, or simply search on google for interview questions! 
You should also prepare yourself with usual HR questions, which u can find in many sites
and books, or even ask aqsa n lakshika, they would be knowing it now what it is like :)

All the BEST!!
