Engineering Paper : -

Ques1:
For a String s
Head(s)= first char of s
Tail(s) = all the chars of s except head 

I.e. is s=”abcd” , head(s)=”a” , tail(s)=”bcd”

So given concat(Head(s),Head(tail(tail(s))) = “ac” , which of the following could be s 

abcd , aabc,acac , aaac


Ques 2.
Binary Search tree is given. Print all the possible routes from root to leaf.
 
Ques 3.
Give a Data Structure to denote a polynomial when :
a)	polynomial is dense
b)	polynomial is sparse
 
Ques 4.
U have a file that is much bigger than RAM , give an algo to sort the file.

Ques 5.

Int power(int base,int n)
{
    if(n==0)
       return 1;
    else 
    {
          int x = power(base,n/2);
          if(n%2==0)
             {
               return x*x;
             }
           else{
                return x*x*base; 
            }
    }
}

if I call power(5,12) then how many multiplications will take place ?


Ques 6.
P1 : read the file
P2 : modify the file
 
Show how will u synchronize the process so that modify can happen only when no one is reading the file. Using constructs

Ques 7.
Given code that did bubble sort and sorted an array in decreasing order. An array is given in sorted order, u have to find out that if the above algo is run on it .. then how many times would two array values be swapped.


Ques 8.
Given two binary tree, how will u find that they are isomorphic (that is at each level they are equal or are mirror image of each other)

Ques 9.
A rectangle is represented by two points P1(x1,y1) and P2(x2,y2) representing lower left and upper right corner.

So given two rectangles , find if they intersect.


 
Interview 1 :

1) A date is represented as yyyy/mm/dd ex : 2001/10/02  .
   Now observe that the above date is a palendrom, so find out the palendrom date which came just before the above date.
  (Hint : September dosn’t have 31 days !!!! )

2) given two stings s1 and s2 , s1 has some characters at the end which are same as   some of s2’s starting characters .. 
   so u have to concatenate the strings so that the repeated portion occurs only once.

Ex :  S1 = “ ABCDEFGHIJK”;
      S2 = “GHIJKXYZ”;

      O/p = “ABCDEFGHIJKXYZ”
      
3) given a big string , u enable a person to underline some characters , for example some body had underlined characters 3-6 and 10-14 and so on .. 
   suggest a Data structure which can record this info effeciently and can accomodate new underlines .
   NOTE : a new underline could lead to updation of records for ex consider a underline that starts from 5-8 .. then above set would become 3-8 and 10-14
   NOTE : a new underline could lead to MERGING of records for ex consider a underline 4-13 .. this would lead to 3-14 in above set.
   
4) arr[2][3][2]={1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12};
   what is value of arr,*arr,**arr,***arr, arr+1 ,*arr+1 ,**arr+1,***a+1
   
5) Given a no N, find all prime nos from 1 to N. using the fastest approach possible.

   Now the answer i gave for this question left him speechless .. 
   He was basically just looking for the soln where i store all the previously encountered primes in an array and just keep dividing my no with them to find if its prime or not
   But because of my maths background i gave a answer which uses Fermat's Theorm and proved much faster than above approach and no extra memory reqd.
   
   After that soln he kind of felt overwhelmed and the interview was over :D
   

Interview 2 :

1) Given M sorted arrays , each having K elements , merge them into a big sorted array of size MK in most efficient manner possible.

   (Hint :- Coreman Question : Use a Heap) 
   
2) If u have to desing ur own Operating System , what mechanism are u going to use for ur file system .

   (I started with using continous blocks to store file , this lead to external fragmentation ..
    so next i told of using linked approach , where in each block i also keep address of next data block
    next moved to FAT system...
    Finally came up with an indexed approach , where first datablock just stored pointers to rest of data blocks)
    
3) Implement a stack such that push,pop and max and min are obtained in O(1)

4) given an array[1...N] which have elements from range 1-N they have elements that are repeated any no of times.
   So give all the approaches u can come up for to find the nos that are repeated.
   
   (first O(n^2) approach : brute force
    then sort and find out 
    then use and extra array of size n 
    then use a bit vector of size n
    no extra memory , whenever u encounter a no go to that index and make the value -ve ....
    and another couple of really fundoo algos were given )
    
5) How will u create ur own C++ library.
  
   (told that i will create my classes and place all my implementations in it. and provide a header file which having the class , macro and typedef declarations.
    He then asked that what approach would u use to avoid mentioning all private and protected functions from the '.h' file
    After about 5 - 10 mins of discussion .. i gave the correct answer .. that i will create a class which has all my private and protected funtions .. and in my 
    original class i will just add a POINTER to that class (Note : Pointer and not object as if i use an object then i have to give my second class's declaration too
    and so will land up at square 1 )
    
6) Create a singleton class in C++


Interview 3 : 

1) given a link list , find if its a palendrom or not.
   (I gave one soln , then he asked me to code a recursive one )
   
2) There is a rectangular table , u and ur friends have identical coins , so u place a coin on table,then ur friend places one (no overlap allowed) , in the end 
   there would be no space left on the table and the person who is not able to place his coin on the table looses.
   So device an algo such that if u place the first coin , u will always win .
   
   (Basically place the coin at the center (point of intersection of diagonals), then wherever the friends places a coin, place a coin at its mirror image across the diagonal,
    so for all his coins u are able to place a coin, hence cancelling his every move, but u have a coin extra at the center and hence in the end u will win)

3) In a party there is  X, X's wife Y along with A,B,C,D,E and F (where b is a's wife , d is c's wife and f is e's wife). So ppl meet and handshakes take place , its given 
   a husband dosnt shake hands with his wife. In the End X asks every1 else the no of handshakes that they had .. and all give different Answers !!!!!!
   IF its given that X shook hands with A. Then u have to find if Y shook hand with A / B / either of them / none of them 
   
4) Applications of Heap, implement heapsort

5) function to generate permutations of a string ( he told me to assume that all characters in string are different)

6) being in line with prev question , he told me to come up with a Data structure that given a string , find all anagrams of string.
   
Interview 4:

1) given a no x , convert it to binary and store it into a char array and return.

   (Looks simple, but is not .. basically u need to take care how much memory u need to allocate the array , then if u are returning , should u create a array 
    or use malloc , then how should the calling function accept it as char * p = fun() or char p[] = fun()
    
    He then changed some lines of code and said now what will happen and so on ..)
   
2) given two very big files , each having around 1 billion lines , u have to print all the lines that are common to both files

   (gave nearly 10 different approaches : 
    brute force , create a binary tree of one file and then keep searching elements of other file in it,sort one file and do binary search , sort both and compare top two and proceed , 
    sort and place the strings in buckets , buckets then gave way to B trees , then hashing , break file into small mangagable chunks and then proceed etc etc ..) 
    
3) what is virtual memory and how would u use it in the previous question

4) given a N X M matrix , find out the total nos of rectangles that can be there.


5) 

   int p = 0x6000;
   int *q = &p;
   
   fun(int *r)
   {
      *r = *q;
   }
   int main()
   {
      int a = 0x5000;
      fun(&a);
      printf(a);
   }
   
   here he asked the o/p. then he made the following change 
   
   he replaced the int * r with char ** r , then asked me what would be the o/p. This really confused me, but i figured out the ans in about 2 mins .
   then he replaced the char ** r with char *r, this looks simpler than pervious case , but believe me .. this is the toughest ,
   
   here when we do *r = *q this would then lead to storage of 0x6000 % 255 to be stored in *r 
   also there is now the case of Endianess, if machine is little Endian then r has changed the Least Significant Byte of a else the Most Significant Byte.
