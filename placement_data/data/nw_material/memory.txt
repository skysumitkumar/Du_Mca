Random access memory (RAM) is the best known form of computer memory. RAM is considered "random
 access" because you can access any memory cell directly if you know the row and column that 
intersect at that cell. RAM data, on the other hand, can be accessed in any order.

An operating system (OS) is a software program that manages the hardware and software resources
 of a computer. The OS performs basic tasks, such as controlling and allocating memory, 
prioritizing the processing of instructions, controlling input and output devices, facilitating
 networking, and managing files.

Modern general-purpose computers, including personal computers and mainframes, have an operating
 system to run other programs, such as application software. Examples of operating systems for 
personal computers include Microsoft Windows, Linux, Mac OS (Darwin), and Unix.

The main advantages of an operating system include:

Allows multiple programs to run concurrently. 
Simplifies the programming of application software because the program does not have to manage 
the hardware. The operating systems manages all hardware and the interaction of software. 
It also gives the program a high level interface to the hardware and ways of interacting 
with other programs.
