 <tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="insP"><tr><td>From the introduction, the seven members of the Fillmore Dirigible filled row
13 of the airplane, in seats A-G from left to right facing the cockpit, with
two seats on each window side of the aisles and three in the middle.  So, by clue 5,
either Ace sat in the center section and the trumpet player in a wing section
or vice versa.  First, we test whether Ace sat in a center section with the
trumpet player across the aisle in a wing section.  By clue 8, Edge had one
of the window seats but did not sit next to the trumpet player; so, Edge would
have sat in the window section on the other side of the plane from the trumpet
player.  By clue 2, the band's two guitar players--bass and lead--sat in
adjacent seats.  The lead guitar player isn't Edge (clue 16) and didn't sit
next to Ace (12); so, either the bass guitar player sat next to Ace with the
lead guitar player in the other aisle seat from Ace, or Edge plays bass
guitar and the lead guitar player is next to him in an aisle seat.  Trying
both possibilities, by clue 9, Mercury was seated directly across
the aisle from the drummer.  Since Ace isn't the drummer (17), Mercury couldn't
be the trumpet player; Mercury also doesn't play lead guitar (7).  So, there
is no way for Mercury (9) to fit into either arrangement; and Ace isn't in the
middle section of the plane.  Ace's aisle seat is in one of the window sections,
and the trumpet player sat directly across from him in the middle seating area.
By clue 2, the guitar players were seated adjacently.  Since the lead guitar
player didn't sit next to Ace (12), the guitar players either sat in the middle
section of the plane or the window seats on the opposite side from Ace.  If
the guitar players had sat in the middle, since the lead guitar player didn't
sit next to the trumpet player (12), the bass guitar player would have had the
middle seat with the lead guitar player on the other aisle from the trumpet
player.  By clue 9, Mercury sat across the aisle from the band's drummer.
Mercury couldn't be the trumpet player, since Ace isn't the drummer (17); and
Mercury doesn't play lead guitar for the Dirigible (7)--so there is no way
for Mercury to fit into the arrangement.  Therefore, the guitar players sat
in the window seats on the opposite side of the airplane from Ace.  By clue 9,
again, Mercury and the drummer sat directly across an aisle from each other.
Since Ace isn't the drummer (17), Mercury isn't the trumpet player.  The
drummer must have been in the middle section of the plane on the aisle nearest
the guitar players, and Mercury plays guitar for the group--by clue 7, bass
guitar.  The lead guitarist had a window seat.  Edge isn't the lead guitar
player (16) but had a window seat (8); Edge sat next to Ace on the flight.
By clue 4, Van Halen sat next to Mick during the flight.  Since Van Halen
didn't have a window seat (10), he and Mick had to have sat in the middle
section.  Van Halen isn't the band's trumpet player (13); so either he sat in
the middle seat or is the group's drummer.  If he sat in the middle seat, he
isn't the band's lead singer (10) or saxophonist (13) and would play keyboards.
Edge isn't Tyler (18), so Tyler would be Ace and Edge would play the sax (3).
By elimination, Ace would be the lead singer.  Then Edge would be Petty (19),
a conflict since Petty isn't the saxophone player (11).  Therefore, Van Halen
is the group's drummer, and Mick had the middle seat (4).  Since Mick isn't the
sax player (20), and Edge isn't Tyler (18), by clue 3, Ace is Tyler and Edge
plays sax for the Fillmores.  Slash and Flea sat next to each other on the
flight (1) and must then be the guitar players.  Slash plays lead guitar and
Flea bass guitar (15).  Axle is Van Halen (21), and Goose plays trumpet.
Neither Goose, Mick (14), nor Slash (22) is Collins; so Edge is.  By clue 19,
then, Goose is Petty and Mick the lead singer.  By elimination, Ace plays
keyboards for the band.  Mick is Springsteen and Slash Rose (15).  Since Slash
Rose didn't sit in seat 13A (6), he must have been in 13G, with Flea in 13F,
Axle in 13E, Mick in 13D, Goose in 13C, Ace in 13B, and Edge in 13A.  In sum,
the Fillmore Dirigible sat as follows on their airplane ride to California:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> 13A -- Edge Collins, saxophone<BR>
<LI> 13B -- Ace Tyler, keyboards<BR>
<LI> 13C -- Goose Petty, trumpet<BR>
<LI> 13D -- Mick Springsteen, lead singer<BR>
<LI> 13E -- Axle Van Halen, drums<BR>
<LI> 13F -- Flea Mercury, bass guitar<BR>
<LI> 13G -- Slash Rose, lead guitar<BR>
