 <tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="insP"><tr><td>Three consecutives months are given in clue 1: the photo of the War of 1812
Monument, the picture taken in Oak Grove, and the shot contributed by
Siobhan O'Leary.  Three more photos in consecutive months are listed in
clue 5: the one of the Tea Garden, the one by Bryan Bradley, and the one
taken in Cozy Valley.  The only possible common photos between the two
are that Siobhan O'Leary took the Tea Garden picture--no (clue 13)--or
that the War of 1812 Monument is in Cozy Valley--no (29).  Therefore, two
different three month sets are given in clues 1 and 5.  Clue 16 gives
three consecutive months: the Wedgely China Factory picture, the one taken
in New Wales, and the photo by Kobi.  Possible overlaps with clue 1 are
that the War Monument photo was shot in New Wales and thus immediately
precedes Kobi's picture in the calendar, which it doesn't (11);
that Kobi shot the picture of the War of 1812 Monument, which he didn't
(11); that the China Factory is in Oak Grove, which it isn't (24); or that
Siobhan O'Leary took the China Factory picture, which she didn't (13).
So, clues 1 and 16 have no common photo.  Possible overlaps between clues
5 and 16 are that the Wedgely China Factory is in Cozy Valley, which it
isn't (32), or that Kobi took the Tea Garden photo--no (30).  So, there
is no commonality between clues 5 and 16; and nine different months are
found in the three clues.  By clue 23, three more consecutive pages have
a picture of the Poe Mansion, a photo by Peter Mix, and a shot of a
landmark in Central City on them.  Possible commonality between clue 23
and clue 1 is that Siobhan O'Leary took the Poe Mansion picture--no (7)
or that the War of 1812 Monument is in Central City--no (29); so there is
no overlap between clues 1 and 23.  Similarly testing clues 5 and 23,
possible overlaps are that Peter Mix took his photo in Cozy Valley, which he
didn't (20); that Poe Mansion is in Cozy Valley, which it isn't (7); that
Peter Mix took the picture of the Tea Garden, which he didn't (33); and
that the Tea Garden is in Central City, which it isn't (33).  Therefore,
there is no overlap between clues 5 and 23.  Testing clues 16 and 23 for
overlap, Kobi's picture would be of the Poe Mansion--no (30)--or the China
Factory is in Central City--no (2); so there is no commonality between
clues 16 and 23.  Each of clues 1, 5, 16, and 23 has three different
consecutive months with no overlap among them.  Therefore, in some order,
the clues must be for January-March, April-June, July-September, and
October-December.  Three consecutive months are given in clue 28: the month
featuring Rita Heyworth's contribution, the month with the picture taken
in Hillsboro, and the month with the picture of the Old Fort on it.  If
clue 28 were to completely overlap one of clues 1, 5, 16, and 23, it would
have to be 5 or 23.  If it were 5, Bryan Bradley's contribution would have
been taken in Hillsboro--no (12); and if it were 23, Peter Mix would have
shot his picture in Hillsboro--also no (20).  Therefore, clue 28 must bridge
two of clues 1, 5, 16, and 23.  In all four cases, Rita Heyworth's photo
cannot overlap the second photo of the three in the clue, or else the Old
Fort picture would have to appear in April, July, or October, a conflict
with what we already know.  Rita Heyworth cannot overlap clues 1 and 16
in the third month.  Since Rita Heyworth didn't take her photo in Central
City (22), she must have taken it in Cozy Valley.  In five consecutive months,
then, we have the Tea Garden picture, the one by Bryan Bradley, the one
taken in Cozy Valley by Rita Heyworth, the picture set in Hillsboro, and
the photo of the Old Fort.  The Tea Garden photo must appear in January,
April, or July.  If it appeared in January, the Hillsboro picture would
be in April--but the April photo was shot in Wintermoor (18).  If the Tea
Garden picture were on July's page, the picture of the Old Fort would be
on November's--again, no, since the photo of the Amish Covered Bridge is
on November's page (21).  Therefore, the Tea Garden highlights the April page, with
Bryan Bradley's photo on May's, Rita Heyworth's Cozy Valley picture on
June's, the Hillsboro shot on July's, and the Old Fort picture featured
in the month of August.  The photo taken in Wintermoor is on the April
page (18), and the Amish Covered Bridge is on the November page (21).
Three more consecutive months are given in clue 4: the picture taken in
Mount Joy, the one by Tia Land, and the photo of the Conemaugh County
Courthouse.  Since Tia Land's photo isn't on the February page (34), the
Mount Joy scene can't be on January's page.  The Mount Joy scene can't
be on the February page, since the Courthouse picture would then be on
the April page where the Tea Garden shot is.  The Mount Joy shot isn't
on the May page, since Tia Land's photo would be on June's, where the
Rita Heyworth shot is established.  The Old Fort isn't in Mount Joy (3),
so the Mount Joy picture isn't on the August page.  If the Mount Joy
picture were on the September page, both the Courthouse and the Covered
Bridge would head November's page.  Since Tia Land's picture isn't of the
Amish Covered Bridge (34), the Mount Joy picture isn't on October's page.
The picture taken in Mount Joy is on the March page, with Tia Land's shot
then on the April and the Conemaugh County Courthouse on the May page.
Going back to clues 1, 16, and 23, one must be for the months January-March.
The Poe Mansion can't be on the January page, since the Central City shot
would then be in March, where the Mount Joy picture is.  If the Wedgely
China Factory picture were on the January page, Kobi's contribution would
be on the March page (16), immediately preceding Tia Land's and a conflict
with clue 27.  So, the January calendar page has a picture of the War of
1812 Monument, the photo taken in Oak Grove is on the February page, and
Siobhan O'Leary took the picture in Mount Joy for the March page.  Since
Peter Mix didn't take the Old Fort picture (3), by clue 23, the Poe Mansion
photo can't be on the July page and must be on the October page.  The shot
by Peter Mix is of the Covered Bridge, and the Central City scene is the
December one.  By elimination, the Wedgely China Factory is featured on the
July page, the Old Fort is in New Wales, and Kobi contributed the picture
for September.  By clue 31, Nick Charles's picture is one month before
that of the Evergreen Arboretum.  From what we already know, the Nick
Charles picture could be on the January, February, or August page.  If
it were on the February page, the Arboretum would be in Mount Joy--no (6).
Since Nick Charles didn't take his picture in New Wales (25), it isn't on
the August page.  Nick Charles took the January photo, and the Evergreen
Arboretum is February's featured landmark.  By clue 19, Andrea Prentice's
picture is one month ahead of the Conemaugh River Rapids photo.  Since
she didn't take her picture in New Wales (10), Andrea Prentice is the
photographer for February, and the River Rapids are March's photo pick.
Since Rita Heyworth didn't take the Fairgrounds photo (22), by clue 8,
the Fairgrounds are on the September page, with Mark Eastman the October
photographer and Karlsbad the locale of the Amish Covered Bridge.  Since
Mark Eastman didn't take his picture in Lundy's Lane (26), by clue 14,
Kobi did, with the G & O Canal Boats on the June page.  By elimination,
December's photo is of the City Market.  Chris Archer took the City
Market photo (9).  By clue 17, the photo in Summerset is on the May page.
By clue 26, Mark Eastman took his picture in Fallbrook, with the Springdale
photo being the first in the calendar.  Finally, by clue 15, J. Dalton
took the China Factory photo and Louisa Mays-Morris the Old Fort one.  In
sum, the Conemaugh County 2003 Calendar is as follows:
