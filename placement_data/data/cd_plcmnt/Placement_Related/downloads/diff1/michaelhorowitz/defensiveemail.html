  Cloudmark is about to release SpamNet which claims to eliminate 90% of junk
  e-mail by harnessing peer-to-peer technology to broaden its filtering mechanism. Users hit the "block" button whenever they
  receive spam, and after that the unwanted e-mail is rejected by any computer loaded with SpamNet software.
  The value of the network increases exponentially with the number of people who
  join it. About 350,000 people have downloaded the software since it became available
  in the summer of 2002 and it's gotten some good reviews.&nbsp;</font></li>
