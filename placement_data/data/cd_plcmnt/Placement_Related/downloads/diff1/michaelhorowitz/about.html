<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">I wrote my first computer program in 1973.
After graduating from college (NYU) in 1975 with minors in both computer science
and mathematics, I worked with IBM mainframes for 21 years. From 1975 to 1984 I
was a programmer. From 1985 to 1995 I was a database administrator. Nine of
those years were spent working with DB2. From 1995 through 1999 I worked in the
Research and Development
group of a large Wall Street financial company. Since then, I have done both technical writing and editing. Currently I do
consulting and web sites.&nbsp;</font></p>
