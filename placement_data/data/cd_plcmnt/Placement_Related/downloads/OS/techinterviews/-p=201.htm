		<h3><a href="-p=201.htm" tppabs="http://www.techinterviews.com/?p=201" rel="bookmark" title="Interview questions: Interview questions on C/C++">Interview questions on C/C++</a></h3>
			<p>A reader submitted the interview questions he was asked. More C/C++ questions will be added here, as people keep sending us a set of 2-3 questions they got on their job itnerview.</p>
	<p><b>Q1: Tell how to check whether a linked list is circular.</b></p>
	<p>A: Create two pointers, each set to the start of the list. Update each as follows:</p>
	<pre>
while (pointer1) {
 pointer1 = pointer1-&gt;next;
 pointer2 = pointer2-&gt;next; if (pointer2) pointer2=pointer2-&gt;next;
 if (pointer1 == pointer2) {
   print (\"circular\n\");
 }
}
</pre>
<a id="more-201"></a><br />
<b>Q2: OK, why does this work?</b></p>
	<p>If a list is circular, at some point pointer2 will wrap around and be either at the item just before pointer1, or the item before that. Either way, it&#8217;s either 1 or 2 jumps until they meet.</p>
	<p><b>How can you quickly find the number of elements stored in a</b> a) static array b) dynamic array ?</p>
	<p><b>Why is it difficult to store linked list in an array?</b></p>
	<p><b>How can you find the nodes with repetetive data in a linked list?</b></p>
	<p><b>Write a prog to accept a given string in any order and flash error if any of the character is different</b>. For example : If abc is the input then abc, bca, cba, cab bac are acceptable but aac or bcd are unacceptable.</p>
	<p><b>This is a C question that I had for an intern position at Microsoft</b>: Write out a function that prints out all the permutations of a string. For example, abc would give you   abc, acb, bac, bca, cab, cba. You can assume that all the characters will be unique. After I wrote out my function, he asked me to figure out from the code how many times the printf statement is run, and also questions on optimizing my algorithm.</p>
	<p>What&#8217;s the output of the following program? Why?</p>
	<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
main()
{
	typedef union
	{
		int a;
		char b[10];
		float c;
	}
	Union;
	
	Union x,y = {100};
	x.a = 50;
	strcpy(x.b,\"hello\");
	x.c = 21.50;
	
	printf(\"Union x : %d %s %f \n\",x.a,x.b,x.c );
	printf(\"Union y :%d %s%f \n\",y.a,y.b,y.c);
}
</pre></blockquote>
	<p><b>Given inputs X, Y, Z</b> and operations | and &#038; (meaning bitwise OR and AND, respectively)</p>
	<p>What is output equal to in<br />

   Your solution works only if loop begins at first element. But original solution works for all cases.

		<p>how can u find no of elements in an array quickly?</p>
	<p>if it is a dynamic array(linked list) the tradition is to keep the count variable in the head<br />
and incrementing it everytime an insertion is performed and decrementing whenever a deletion is performed.so by seeing that count vaiable we can easily tell no. of elements.

        ur condition within the while loop is never going to be false if it is a circular<br />
linked list. a break is needed.

	<p><cite>Tech Interviews comment by <b>karthikeyan</b></cite> </p>

	<li id="comment-7269">
		<p>Got a question that extends on the detecting circular linked list question:<br />
Given the constraints that you cannot modify the struct (or class) of the elements, and that you have to remove the loop in the cyclic linked list in O(n) time and O(1) space, how would you do it?<br />
By removing the loop, I mean something like:<br />
                           _______________________________<br />
 __      __      __      _|      __      __      __      _|<br />
|  | -&gt; |  | -&gt; |  | -&gt; |  | -&gt; |  | -&gt; |  | -&gt; |  | -&gt; |  |<br />
 &#8212;      &#8212;      &#8212;      &#8212;      &#8212;      &#8212;      &#8212;      &#8211;</p>
	<p>Given this linked list, how do you make the last element in the list to point to NULL in O(n) time and O(1) space?</p>
	<p>I couldn&#8217;t think of a solution that uses O(1) space without modifying the structure.  If I was allowed, I could just have a visited flag inside the struct.  I&#8217;ll then have 2 pointers, a current and a previous.  For every node traversed by the current, I will set the flag to true, and each traversal, I will check whether that flag is set to true.  If it is, then the previous pointer is the last element of the list, and I can just set the next to NULL.  This will also be in O(n) time.</p>
	<p>Any insights on this?

		<p>The picture of the linked list was kinda screwed up&#8230;<br />
Anyway, that picture has 8 elements, with the last element pointing to the 4th element, thus making a loop in the list.

		<p>Not to mention the glaring access-violation once pointer2 becomes NULL(though this error indicates &#8216;not circular&#8217;), the unnecessity of traversing pointer1(though doing so does not impact numof iterations), and the lack of terminating conditions(though still technically within the guidlines by only &#8220;checking for circular&#8221;), the solution is FLAWED in that it will print &#8220;Circular&#8221; for non-circular lists with 1 node!!! (when Pointer1 and Pointer2 are both NULL)  I did think it was a kinda cool idea to weed out the non-circular lists in (num of Nodes)/2 iterations, but the extra traversal code i think outweighs any benefit.<br />
My elegant solution, if i do say so myself:</p>
	<p>//assert: list is not empty<br />
for(node=head-&gt;next; node!=NULL &amp;&amp; node!=head; node=node-&gt;next);</p>

      i dont think my code is lack of terminating condition. i have put while(head-&gt;data&#8211;)<br />
but i should have copied that head-&gt;data into a temporary variable. it should look like</p>
	<p>int temp1=head-&gt;data<br />
while(temp1&#8211;)&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;</p>
	<p> i dont think it will print &#8220;circular&#8221; for all single node lists.<br />
 if the&#8217;next&#8217; of the single node is the address of the node&#8230;it will print circular.<br />
 otherwise it will print &#8220;not circular&#8221;.</p>
	<p>the idea is to get the address in the &#8216;next&#8217; field of the last node(node which was inserted latest)<br />
i dont think there is a better way than traversing to reach &#8216;last&#8217; node.</p>
	<p>And&#8230;in ur code u assumed that the &#8216;last&#8217; node&#8217;s next point to the Head.<br />
i think its not a good design. it ruins the whole list then.

		<p>Sorry karthikeyan, I should have been more clear: I was referring to the original solution (by default). It seems to have been torn up enough already, but i wanted to show off my fancy 1 line traversal.<br />
However, in rebuttal:<br />
-You&#8217;re fired! Mistaking an equality operator(==) with an assignment(=) is an offense punishable by death.<br />
-Your solution is unintelligible with that mangled loop condition. However relying on a count of num of nodes makes your algorithm possibly unscalable to lists with dummy nodes, for example.<br />
-A chain of pointers will either end in a NULL pointer(if programmed responsibly), or you&#8217;ll eventually be back where you started again. I don&#8217;t see how this testing ruins a list.  Your point is noted, though, about a list with a dummy head that is bypassed around the circle (Like this: -0 ); but that doesn&#8217;t look like a circle to me, and I feel that head should point to the first node and any extra information should be stored in a wrapping class (because starting at the front of the list would mean dereferencing twice; silly if traversed many times each game loop, for example).  However, to address that issue for those small standalone-pointers-as-lists, you would send the first &#8216;real&#8217; node ( head-&gt;next ) to this function. It is not completely efficient in that there is no specific head to terminate at - you must traverse all the way back around to the given node, but it works for any list.  My beautiful(concise) function, if i do say so myself:</p>
	<p>bool isCircular(Node* node1)<br />
{<br />
  if(node1==NULL) return false;<br />
  for(Node* node2=node1-&gt;next; node2!=NULL &amp;&amp; node2!=node1; node2=node2-&gt;next);<br />
  return (node2!=NULL);<br />
