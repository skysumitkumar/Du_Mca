			<p>Some good C++ questions to ask a job applicant.</p>
	<ol>
	<li>How do you decide which integer type to use?
	<li>What should the 64-bit integer type on new, 64-bit machines be?<br />
<a id="more-69"></a></p>
	<li>What&#8217;s the best way to declare and define global variables?
	<li>What does extern mean in a function declaration?
	<li>What&#8217;s the auto keyword good for?
	<li>I can&#8217;t seem to define a linked list node which contains a pointer to itself.
	<li>How do I declare an array of N pointers to functions returning pointers to functions returning pointers to characters?
	<li>How can I declare a function that returns a pointer to a function of its own type?
	<li>My compiler is complaining about an invalid redeclaration of a function, but I only define it once and call it once. What&#8217;s happening?
	<li>What can I safely assume about the initial values of variables which are not explicitly initialized?
	<li>Why can&#8217;t I initialize a local array with a string?
	<li>What is the difference between char a[] = &#8220;string&#8221;; and char *p = &#8220;string&#8221;; ?
	<li>How do I initialize a pointer to a function?

		<p>Hi All,</p>
	<p>This is Sachin for the first time on this site. The questions on this site are really good. I am giving the answers for some of the questions:</p>
	<p>How do you decide which integer type to use?<br />
Ans: It depends on our requirement. When we are required an integer to be stored in 1 byte (means  less than or equal to 255) we use short int, for 2 bytes we use int, for 8 bytes we use long int.</p>
	<p>What&#8217;s the best way to declare and define global variables?<br />
Ans: The best way to declare global variables is to declare them after including all the files so that it can be used in all the functions.</p>
	<p>What does extern mean in a function declaration?<br />
Ans: Using extern in a function declaration we can make a function such that it can used outside the file in which it is defined.</p>
	<p>What&#8217;s the auto keyword good for?<br />
Ans: </p>
	<p>I can&#8217;t seem to define a linked list node which contains a pointer to itself.<br />
Ans: The follwing is the structure for a node of a link list:<br />
struct node<br />
{<br />
    int item;<br />
    struct node *next;<br />
};</p>
	<p>My compiler is complaining about an invalid redeclaration of a function, but I only define it once and call it once. What&#8217;s happening?<br />
Ans: One might have called that function with incorrect number of arguments thats why compiler is not able to identify the function. Other reason may be one is calling that without declaring it.</p>
	<p>What can I safely assume about the initial values of variables which are not explicitly initialized?<br />
Ans: It depends on complier which may assign any garbage value to a variable if it is not initialized. </p>
	<p>What is the difference between char a[] = &#8220;string&#8221;; and char *p = &#8220;string&#8221;;?<br />
Ans: In the first case 6 bytes are allocated to the variable a which is fixed, where as in the second case if *p is assigned to some other value the allocate memory can change.

		<p>Hi Russ,</p>
	<p>I am quite agree with you on certain issues. Let me discuss each questions one by one again..</p>
	<p>How do you decide which integer type to use?</p>
	<p>Your answer: As I understand it, a char is for 1-byte integers, a short is for 2-byte integers, an int is generally a 2-byte or 4-byte integer (though not necessarily), a long is a 4-byte integer, and a long long is a 8-byte integer.</p>
	<p>Comments for this answer: Both of us have given the correct answers but the only difference is I have worked on Windows enviroment in which only 2 bytes are allocated for int. As I answered this questions considering many of us are working on windows environment. You are talking for UNIX environment. Hope that this you must have got this.</p>
	<p>What&#8217;s the best way to declare and define global variables?</p>
	<p>Your answer: This question doesn&#8217;t even make a lot of sense to me. But assuming this is a reasonable question to ask a candidate, wouldn&#8217;t you want to declare the global variable *before* the #includes if you wanted it to be available for use in the other functions? And if you&#8217;re saying this variable is available in other functions, what are these functions supposed to do when they are included in another file that doesn&#8217;t have this global variable, cease to work?</p>
	<p>Comments for this answer: As far as I know global variables are always defined after including all the files. If one want to share the variables across the files, he must use extern. Till now I haven&#8217;t seen any code in which any variables are defined before including the files. If you come across such a code let me know.</p>
	<p>What does extern mean in a function declaration?</p>
	<p>Your answer: It&#8217;s my understanding that if you want to have a function definition (the body of the function) in one file, and call the function from another file, the best practice is to make a header file which all C files which call the function can include (and the C file with the definition would include too, of course), and put the function declaration in the header. As I understand it, extern is more useful when you are compiling a shared library (a shared object in linux, a DLL in windows) and you want a function to be callable from the compiled object. It tells the compiler you want it to put an calling anchor for this function call in the final compiled module.</p>
	<p>Comments for this answer: I think you didn&#8217;t get my answer. Let me give you my answer in more detail again. </p>
	<p>My answer: An extern variable, function definition, or declaration also makes the described variable or function usable by the succeeding part of the current source file. This declaration does not replace the definition. The declaration is used to describe the variable that is externally defined. </p>
	<p>If a declaration for an identifier already exists at file scope, any extern declaration of the same identifier found within a block refers to that same object. If no other declaration for the identifier exists at file scope, the identifier has external linkage. </p>
	<p>What can I safely assume about the initial values of variables which are not explicitly initialized?</p>
	<p>Your answer: It&#8217;s important that you always assume the compiler will initialize variables to garbage and plan accordingly.</p>
	<p>Comments for this answer: I didn&#8217;t get any difference between my answer and yours.</p>
	<p>What is the difference between char a[] = &#8220;string&#8221;; and char *p = &#8220;string&#8221;;?</p>
	<p>I am agree with the answer that you have given for this question. Sorry I have given my answer as per &#8216;C&#8217; not &#8216;C++&#8217; where only 6 bytes are allocated to for a string of length 6.

		<p>for Question 12,<br />
a[] = &#8220;string&#8221;;<br />
char *p = &#8220;string&#8221;;</p>
	<p>The difference is this:<br />
 p is pointing to a constant string, you can never safely say<br />
 p[3]=&#8217;x';<br />
 however you can always say a[3]=&#8217;x';</p>
	<p> char a[]=&#8221;string&#8221;;  - character array initialization.<br />
 char *p=&#8221;string&#8221; ;  - non-const pointer to a const-string.( this is permitted only in the case of char pointer in C++ to preserve backward compatibility with C.)</p>
	<p>Hope that helps.<br />

		<p>How do I declare an array of N pointers to functions returning pointers to functions returning pointers to characters? </p>
	<p>If you want the code to be even slightly readable, you will use typedefs.</p>
	<p>typedef char* (*functiontype_one)(void);<br />
typedef functiontype_one (*functiontype_two)(void);<br />
functiontype_two myarray[N]; //assuming N is a const integral</p>
	<p>What&#8217;s the auto keyword good for?<br />
Not much.  It declares an object with automatic storage duration.  Which means the object will be destroyed at the end of the objects scope.  All variables in functions that are not declared as static and not dynamically allocated have automatic storage duration by default. For example</p>
	<p>int main()<br />
{<br />
int a; //this is the same as writing &#8220;auto int a;&#8221;<br />
}
</p>

	<li id="comment-1379">
		<p>Another possible answer to Q9 could be that, given the function declaration is in a header file, you are &#8220;#include&#8221;&#8216;ing this header file twice, hence its good practice to add the following to your headerfile:<br />
#ifndef _HEADERH<br />
 #define _HEADERH<br />
#endif /* _HEADERH */</p>
	<p>(Where our header file name is &#8220;header.h&#8221;)</p>
	<p>no?

	<li id="comment-1429">
		<p>In response to Sachin/Russ&#8217;s answers:<br />
what int type to use:<br />
C/C++ are very loose in interpretation of what &#8216;int&#8217; is.  Use the one that gives you enough space, considering your platform and compiler.  If you don&#8217;t know for sure that this will always be constant, typedef it so that you can change it later.  Good example of this is porting code for 64 bit computers from 32.<br />
C/C++ define int to be something that holds an integer value.  Short int is guaranteed to not be larger than int, and long int is guaranteed to not be smaller.  Both can be the same as int.  It is up to the implemntation as to what int is.  On 32-bit machines, this is often (for speed&#8217;s sake) implemented such that &#8216;int&#8217; is 32 bit, short int is smaller, and is 16bits, long int is 32bits (since in 16-bit days &#8217;short&#8217; used to be the same as regular int, and long was 32 bit).  Compilers that support it have &#8216;long long&#8217; which is 64-bit (gcc supports it.  Visual C++ has __int64).  On 64-bit architectures, int would be 64-bit, long int would be at least that, and short int probably becomes 32bits.  How to create a 16-bit value then?  I don&#8217;t know :)</p>
	<p>extern:<br />
Gives information to the compiler about something that will be provided at a later point from another source module (most likely during the static link at the end of the compile phase).  Also able to change the calling convention for functions (and thus C++ programs use extern &#8220;C&#8221; {} to signify that the functions in there export as C style calling conventions.)  What I think sachin is trying to say in his clarification is that you can have both an extern and the normal definition in the same file, and it won&#8217;t cause problems.  But the real definition needs to be made somewhere, and in only one spot.  Whereas the declaration (which contains the extern) needs to be made everywhere before it is used.</p>
	<p>global variables:<br />
How global do you want them?  Provide an &#8216;extern&#8217; declaration in a header file.  include that inside of whatever files need access to this variable.  In a source file, have the same definition without the extern: this is what actually allocates the memory inside the executable.  Without this, you basically have an unfulfilled promise that there will be a variable with this name linked in, but all the source modules expect it to come from somewhere else.  Duplicating the definition without the export line is important.  This will make the variable global to any part of the project that includes the header file with the extern definition.  If you include it in a header file without the extern definition, and have that header file used more than once in the entire project, you&#8217;ll get collisions at link time (since multiple files claim they own the global variable foo).</p>
	<p>Global to the file only (this is only a scoping issue.. it is still technically a global variable, but is hidden from all other source files by the compiler), make the variable static.  This will make a global variable only accessible by that source file (and any #included after its definition, I believe.  I&#8217;m not sure on this.  That&#8217;s bad form anyway).  So multiple source files can have a global variable that is local to that source file, with the same name.  This does not cause issues at link time.  But, they don&#8217;t share space or share the value, so while it is still technically global (all functions in that source file have access to it, and it acts like a global variable), it is not accessible to any other source files.  </p>
	<p>Hopefully that clears up some confusion :)

	<li id="comment-3649">
		<p>all functions are extern by default (the only other storage class modifier that can be put on functions is static - which means that  they are only visible within their own translation unit).  extern makes the function available in any translation unit of the program (ie.. the usual behavior you are used to seeing, because this is the default storage specifier for a function).  btw, if you try to call a function without having a declaration for it, the compiler will assume it is storage class extern type int&#8230;.

		<p>must say reading some of your comments just solved a problem that i have with my linker here : error = multiple varible definition. it nearly made me go nuts, other sites recommended using compiler directives, but mine was a different situation, i did not have many .h files , i had only one , and i was trying to define a global var in the .h file and including it in both the main file and the other .cpp file, and i kept getting the error untill i read some of the comments here( even though they sound flamy). I thereby realised that exetern keywords will do the trick. you first define you global var in one file and then append the extern contruct on the other files. simple as is it is , it nearly made me go nuts. thank you guys .

		<p>just want to know the difference between a function declaration and its definition, like for intance :<br />
// I hope this below should be a definition<br />
void lnk(){<br />
  s = &#8220;Start&#8221;;<br />
  int j;<br />
  printf(&#8221;\n%s\n\n&#8221;, s);<br />
  for (j = 0; j < 10; j++) cout << &#8220;Link &#8221; << j << &#8220;\n&#8221;;<br />
}  </p>
	<p>and the prototype - extern void lnk(); be a declaration</p>
	<p>Is possible to define a function in a .h file. And what are the implications of doing so. Of course I will not do such a thing , I am just asking out of curiousity casue i havent seen anyone do so.<br />
Actually i think(if i remember well)some std c lib functions are actually inlined and placed in .h files. why dont we have problem of multiple definition error like the one i described above in those situations ?<br />
thanks in advance for some enlightment.
