<P>
The course discusses homogenization and structural optimization.  
These topics are closely connected: both are dealing with PDE with fast variable 
coefficients. The focus of the course is the optimization of properties of 
inhomogeneous bodies by varying their structures. 
<P>
<B>I. </B> We start with the theory of homogenization which will be taught from 
the book by Bensoussan, Lions, and Papanicolaou, plus from recent research 
papers.

The homogenization is the natural procedure to describe processes in complicated 
structures with  <b> known </b> microstructures. It allows to replace a highly 
inhomogeneous 
medium with an equivalent homogeneous material,
to estimate the norm of fluctuations of fields, etc. 
<P>
 We also formulate the central problem of structural optimization
 about "the best" geometrical composition of the structure.
</TD> 
<TD> 
</TD> 
<TD> 
<HR>
Homogenization reduces the original problem to a problem which is doable, and 
this simplified problem reflects most of important features of the original one. 
<P>
The coefficients  of homogenized equations significantly depend on the 
structure. If the structure is <b> unknown </b>, we can only determine the  <A 
HREF="composites.html" tppabs="http://www.math.utah.edu/~cherk/composites.html"> bounds </A> of the coefficients, that are   
independent of the structure.

<B>II. </B> The optimization of structures naturally follows the previous topic.
We give an introduction to the optimization theory, optimal control, necessary 
conditions, minimizing sequences. 
<BR> 
Then several 
<A HREF="struct_opt.html" tppabs="http://www.math.utah.edu/~cherk/opt/struct_opt.html">structural optimization </A> 
 problems are discussed, such as the maximization of the stiffness of a 
structure, <A HREF="ab.html" tppabs="http://www.math.utah.edu/~cherk/comics2/ab.html"> a game between the load and the 
structure,  </A>
structures of <A HREF="composites.html" tppabs="http://www.math.utah.edu/~cherk/composites.html"> optimal composites </A>.   Finally, 
we will discuss "suboptimal" projects that are much simpler than the truly 
optimal ones, and possess almost the same cost. 
<P>
Applications include: structural optimization of electro-conducting and 
mechanical constructions, phase equilibrium and phase transition, the  
biological systems, which are both structured and rational. 
</TD>
</TABLE>

During the class, we cover several hot topics and techniques of the modern 
applied math. Specifically:
  <UL>
 <LI>  Homogenization of elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic operators. 
Effective properties, bounds.  
 <LI>  Convexity and non-linear programming. Control theory.  Maximum principle.
 <LI>  Control of PDE systems: optimization of coefficients (material 
properties) and optimization of sources (loadings).  
 <LI>  Examples of structural optimization,  phase equilibrium, bio-materials.
 </UL>

 The course is addressed to graduate  students in math, science, and 
engineering.
<P> 

Several topics for course projects will be suggested. Most welcome are the  
students own  projects.
