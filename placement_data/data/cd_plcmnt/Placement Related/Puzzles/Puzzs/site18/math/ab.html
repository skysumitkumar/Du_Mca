The presented form of publication 
is not  a joke or a charade-type game:
it imitates informal conversations between 
colleagues when a letter envelope is used to
illustrate ideas and approaches. In mathematics, this style is proved to be very efficient and it seems to be consistent with Web 
mainstream tone.

We decided to keep this informal style in 
our Web discussion of the  problem of
structural optimization we formulate below. 
The standard mathematical text is placed in the Epilogue.

to maximize the stiffness.

The best strategy for the force is to be applied in a certain way and  the best strategy for the  structure is to resist that force. All other admissible forces are less harmful and the defense against them is provided automatically.

Mathematically, the solution is called the  saddle point solution or the solution in pure strategies.  It is a fair compromise between the loads and the designs: any variation of the the solution by one of the players will be punished by the other player.

There are games which require the consideration of several equally dangerous loadings.
Here the strategy is different: an optimal  design offers equal  resistance against a class of equally harmful  loadings, rather then  the extremal resistance to a single loading.

Examples  of optimal design of a structure and of a wheel  are placed below, in the Epilogue.

<CAPTION>Optimal design of the topology is formulated  as a problem  of an optimal mixture

<TD> The wheel is loaded by a concentrated force that is applied in a point of the rim of the wheel. <BR>

           Here, there is no single "most dangerous loading" : the design resists several loadings simultaneously, compromising the resistivity is several directions. </FONT> </TD></TR> </Table> 
</Center>

Unlike the saddle point games, the solution of these games depends on the sequence of moves. The design must be decided <I> prior to</I> applying the force. Note that the inverse sequence of moves corresponds to quite different situation -- to  the problem of the best best structure resisting a given load. 
<p>
Mathematically, the solution is called  the solution in mixed strategies.  It equalizes  the impact of several loading.

<BR>

To restrict a class of acting loads, we  suppose that the integral over the loaded boundary of a positive quadratic form of them is fixed. Then, 
the problem of the best force can be formulated as  an eigenvalues problem of the first eigenfrequency of  the vibrating structure with inertia elements concentrated on its loaded  boundary.   The problem typically is reduced to Steklov eigenvalue problem. The optimal applied load is the first eigenvector of that problem, and the stiffness is equal to the first (minimal) eigenvalue. <BR>
The optimization with respect to the structure requires maximization of the minimal eigenvalue. 
The mixed strategies correspond to the multiplicity of the minimal eigenvalue.
