  <p><font size=+1>What portion of a cube is occupied by a pyramid spanning
four adjacent</font>
<br><font size=+1>corners? In other words, if you stood in a corner of
the floor of</font>
<br><font size=+1>a cubical room facing its center, and divided off a section
with a</font>
<br><font size=+1>piece of plywood which went straight from the corners
of the floor</font>
<br><font size=+1>to your right and left to the corner of the ceiling above
you,</font>
<br><font size=+1>how much of the room would be walled off? This may be
answered</font>
<br><font size=+1>using calculus by finding the volume of the portion of
the</font>
<br><font size=+1>unit cube (0&lt;=x&lt;=1,0&lt;=y&lt;=1,0&lt;=z&lt;=1)
with x+y+z&lt;=1. This latter</font>
<br><font size=+1>inequality describes the `(0,0,0)' (you) side of the
plane containing</font>
<br><font size=+1>the three corner points (1,0,0) (floor to your right),
(0,1,0) (floor</font>
<br><font size=+1>to your left), and (0,0,1) (ceiling above you). Each
of these points</font>
<br><font size=+1>satisfies the equation of that plane x+y+z=1, and together
comprise</font>
<br><font size=+1>three points determining it.</font>
<p><font size=+1>This dissection determines that the volume of that pyramid,
called</font>
<br><font size=+1>a standard 3-simplex by mathematicians (the standard
2-simplex is</font>
<br><font size=+1>the triangle x+y&lt;=1 in the unit square 0&lt;=x&lt;=1,0&lt;=y&lt;=1,
and so on)</font>
<br><font size=+1>to be 1/6 that of the cube without calculus. The key
observation</font>
<br><font size=+1>we need to do this is, is that when similar solids are
scaled so that</font>
<br><font size=+1>corresponding lengths are scaled by a factor r, then
corresponding</font>
<br><font size=+1>volumes are scaled by r<sup>3</sup>, r cubed. This is
apparent for a cube,</font>
<br><font size=+1>where exactly 8 half-scaled cubes fit in the full cube,
27 third-scaled</font>
<br><font size=+1>cubes fit in the full cube, and so on. If the volumes
of other shaped</font>
<br><font size=+1>solids could be built from or approximated by cubes,
then their</font>
<br><font size=+1>volumes should also scale by the cube of the length scaling.</font>
<p><font size=+1>The first stage of the dissection removes four congruent
corner</font>
<br><font size=+1>pyramids from the cube, two containing the floor, reflections</font>
<br><font size=+1>of each other across a diagonal of the room, and two
containing</font>
<br><font size=+1>the ceiling, reflections of each other across the other
diagonal.</font>
<br><font size=+1>This leaves a regular tetrahedron with four congruent
equilateral</font>
<br><font size=+1>triangle faces in the center. The volume of this tetrahedron
is</font>
<br><font size=+1>equal to that of two of the corner pyramids, which is
demonstrated</font>
<br><font size=+1>in the next two stages.</font>
<p><font size=+1>The second stage divides the tetrahedron into two equal
volumes</font>
<br><font size=+1>by cutting off four similar half-scale corners, separated
at the</font>
<br><font size=+1>midpoints of each edge. Since each half-scale tetrahedron
represents</font>
<br><font size=+1>one eighth the volume of the original tetrahedron, we
have removed</font>
<br><font size=+1>four eighths or one half of the volume.</font>
<p><font size=+1>The third stage exhibits the remaining truncated tetrahedron
is</font>
<br><font size=+1>in fact a regular octahedron, whose six vertices are
the</font>
<br><font size=+1>centers of the original cube. (They are the midpoints
of the</font>
<br><font size=+1>tetrahedron each of whose six edges was a diagonal on
which</font>
<br><font size=+1>the original cube was sliced.) It is broken into eight pieces
each</font>
<br><font size=+1>of which is a half-scale version of the original corner
pyramid.</font>
<br><font size=+1>Thinking again of the octahedron as sitting inside the
original</font>
<br><font size=+1>cube, each of these pieces arises from joining the center
point</font>
<br><font size=+1>to the centers of three adjacent faces, and spanning
those</font>
<br><font size=+1>center points with a plane. This is the same construction
we</font>
<br><font size=+1>used to slice off the corners, with the sides which play
the</font>
<br><font size=+1>roles of the cube edges now half as long (center of cube
to</font>
<br><font size=+1>center of face.) Then the volume of each of these pieces</font>
<br><font size=+1>is one eighth that of the original corner pieces, and
since</font>
<br><font size=+1>eight of them comprise the regular octahedron, its volume</font>
<br><font size=+1>is equal to that of the original corner.</font>
<p><font size=+1>In summary, the volume of the octahedron equals that of
the</font>
<br><font size=+1>corner pyramid, the volume of the tetrahedron is twice
that</font>
<br><font size=+1>of the corner pyramid, and the volume of four corner
pyramids</font>
<br><font size=+1>plus tetrahedron equals four corner pyramids plus two
corner</font>
<br><font size=+1>pyramids equals the volume of the cube. If the volume
of</font>
<br><font size=+1>the unit cube is set to one, then the volume of the</font>
<br><font size=+1>corner pyramids and the octahedron is one-sixth, and
the</font>
<br><font size=+1>volume of the regular tetrahedron is one third.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font size=+1>Exercise: This construction involves three of the five
Platonic</font>
<br><font size=+1>regular solids, the cube and octahedron (duals of each
other-</font>
<br><font size=+1>the vertices of one interchange with the centers of the
faces</font>
<br><font size=+1>of the other) and the tetrahedron (self-dual). Examine
the other</font>
<br><font size=+1>two (icosahedron,dodecahedron).</font>
<p><font size=+1>Exercise: Compute the length of the sides of the equilateral
triangle</font>
<br><font size=+1>face of a corner pyramid, and its area.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Exercise: Compute the length of the sides of the regular</font>
<br><font size=+1>tetrahedron which remains after the corners of the cube
are removed,</font>
<br><font size=+1>the area of its faces, and its altitude. Compute the
face area</font>
<br><font size=+1>and volume of a tetrahedron with unit side length.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font size=+1>Exercise: Determine the length of the sides, the altitude,</font>
<br><font size=+1>and the area of the faces of the octahedron. Scale these</font>
<br><font size=+1>to determine the altitude/diameter, area of sides, and</font>
<br><font size=+1>volume of an octahedron with unit side length.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font size=+1>Exercise: Check that all corresponding lengths of similar
figures</font>
<br><font size=+1>scale by the scale factor of any correspoding lengths,
and corresponding</font>
<br><font size=+1>areas scale by the length scale factor squared (r<sup>2</sup>).
Can you</font>
<br><font size=+1>construct any objects which scale by powers which are
not whole</font>
<br><font size=+1>numbers? A candidate for such an object, called a fractal,
might</font>
<br><font size=+1>be something which is equal to three half-scaled copies
of itself,</font>
<br><font size=+1>between two (=2<sup>1</sup>, one dimensional) and four
(=2<sup>2</sup>, two dimensional).</font>
<br><font size=+1>What would its dimension be?</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font size=+1>Exercise: Describe a standard 4-simplex.</font></center>
