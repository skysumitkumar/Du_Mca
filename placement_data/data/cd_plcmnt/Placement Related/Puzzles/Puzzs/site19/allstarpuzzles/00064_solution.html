 <tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="insP"><tr><td>From the introduction, each Gert's Gas & Go employee had a different kind of
burger and fries for lunch.  From the menu, the least any of the five could
have spent was $3.20, $1.95 for the Whaler FishBurger and $1.25 for the Cajun
Fries, while the most anyone could have paid would be $4.80, $2.85 for The
Works Burger and $1.95 for the Big Fries.  By clue 1, Tom spent $1.20 more
than the car wash operator; while by clue 2, Wayne's bill was $1.20 more than
the cashier's.  If either Wayne were the car wash operator or Tom were the
cashier, so that clues 1 and 2 overlapped, the range between the high and low
would be $2.40--impossible given the $1.60 range already established.  So,
four of the five employees are named in clues 1 and 2.  Since the least
anyone could have spent for lunch is $3.20, the least Tom and Wayne could have
paid would be $4.40 (clues 1, 2).  Neither could then have bought the Whaler
Fishburger at $1.95, since coupling with the most expensive fries at $1.95
would only give $3.90; nor could either have ordered the Double Cheeseburger
at $2.25, since pairing it with the Big Fries would give $4.20.  If either Tom
or Wayne had gotten the Tucson TacoBurger for $2.45, he would have had to have
spent the $1.95 for the Big Fries for a total of $4.40; then either the car wash
operator or the cashier would have spent the #3.20 minimum (1, 2), $1.95 on the
Whaler FishBurger and $1.25 on the Cajun Fries.  The least any of the other
three employees could then have spent would be $3.60 (the Double Cheeseburger
at $2,25 and the Cheese Fries at $1.35), so that the other of Tom and Wayne who
didn't spend the $4.40 would have to have paid $4.80 in clue 1 or 2.  However,
that would necessitate the person purchasing The Works Burger at $2.85 and the
Big Fries at $1.95--but the Big Fries would already have been paired with the
Tucson Tacoburger.  Therefore, neither Tom nor Wayne had the $2.45 Tucson
TacoBurger for lunch; Tom and Wayne had the $2.85 The Works Burger and $2.75
Carolina PitBurger respectively or vice versa.  Since the least anyone could
have spent is $3.20, the $2.85 The Works Burger would have to be paired with
fries that would add up to at least $4.40 (1, 2)--so the Cajun Fries at $1.25
(total of $4.10) and Cheese Fries at $1.35 (total of $4.20) can't have been
paired with it.  If The Works Burger had been combined for lunch with the $1.75
Gravy Fries for a total bill of $4.60, by clues 1 and 2, either the car wash
operator or the cashier would have spent $3.40.  But there is no combination
of hamburger and fries among the four of each that would remain that adds up to
$3.40--so The Works Burger wasn't paired with the Gravy Fries.  If The Works
Burger had been bought with a side of Curly Fries at $1.65 for a total of $4.50,
the car wash operator or the cashier would have spent $3.30 for lunch (1, 2)
and would have had to have bought the $1.95 Whaler FishBurger and $1.35 Cheese
Fries.  The other of Tom and Wayne in clues 1 and 2 would have bought the
Carolina PitBurger for $2.75; it couldn't have come with the $1.25 Cajun Fries
since Tom and Wayne spent at least $4.40 (1, 2).  It also couldn't have come
with the $1.75 Gravy Fries, since then the combo would have cost a total of
$4.50, the same as The Works Burger-Curly Fries combo and a contradiction of
the introduction where no two Gert's Gas & Go employees spent the same sum on
lunch.  So, the Carolina PitBurger would have been with the $1.95 Big Fries for
a total of $4.70.  From clues 1 and 2, a fourth meal would have cost $3.50--the
Double Cheeseburger at $2.25 and the Cajun Fries at $1.25.  The fifth lunch
would have had a $4.20 tab--$2.45 for the Tucson TacoBurger and $1.75 for the
Gravy Fries.  Since the car wash operator's meal cost more than Sharon's (1),
the car wash operator couldn't have had the $3.30 lunch in clues 1 and 2 and
would have had the $3.50 one, with Tom's then costing the $4.70.  In clues 1
and 2, then, Wayne would have spent $4.50 and the cashier, Sharon, $3.30.  By
clue 3, the mechanic's hamburger cost 50� more than Russ's; Russ would
have to have had the $2.25 Double Cheeseburger and Tom would be the Gert's
Gas & Go mechanic.  Then, by elimination, Vicky
would have ordered the Tucson TacoBurger.  However, the stock clerk isn't Vicky
and didn't order the Curly Fries (4), so this arrangement fails.  The Works Burger wasn't
in combination with the $1.65 Curly Fries.  It came with the Big Fries at $1.95,
a total of $4.80, so that the car wash operator or cashier spent $3.60 (1, 2).
The $3.60 order has to have been either the $2.25 Double Cheeseburger with the
$1.35 Cheese Fries or the $1.95 Whaler FishBurger with the $1.65 Curly Fries.
Trying the latter case, the $2.75 Carolina PitBurger in clue 1 or 2 would have
to have been accompanied by the $1.75 Gravy Fries to reach the minimum of $4.40
decided earlier--a total of $4.50, so that the other of the lower-priced meals
in clues 1 and 2 would have cost $3.30.  There is now no way to make a $3.30
piriced meal with the remaining items.  So, the $3.60 order must have been the
$2.25 Double Cheeseburger with the $1.35 Cheese Fries.  The order with the
$2.75 Carolina PitBurger in it had to be for at least $4.40, so it didn't
contain the $1.25 Cajun Fries.  If the $1.75 Gravy Fries were in it, for a total
of $4.50, the fourth order would have cost $3.30.  However, there is no way to
make a $3.30 pairing from the remaining items.  So, the $2.75 Carolina PitBurger
and $1.65 Curly Fries came together, a total of $4.40, so that the fourth meal
in clues 1 and 2 cost $3.20.  That meal must consist of the $1.95 Whaler
FishBurger and the $1.25 Cajun Fries; the fifth meal is then the $2.45 Tucson
TacoBurger and $1.75 Gravy Fries for a totla bill of $4.20.  Since  the car wash
operator spent more than Sharon (1), in clues 1 and 2, Tom spent the $4.80 and
the car wash operator the $3.60, while Wayne paid $4.40 and cashier Sharon's
lunch cost $3.20.  By clue 3, Wayne is the mechanic and Russ ate the
Double Cheeseburger.  Vicky's meal cost $4.20.  By clue 4, she is Gert's Gas &
Go's manager, and Tom is the stock clerk.  In sum, the five employees enjoyed
their Big Bill's Burgers and Fries as follows:
