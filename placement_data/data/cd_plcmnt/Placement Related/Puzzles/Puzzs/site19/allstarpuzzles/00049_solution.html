 <tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="insP"><tr><td>From the introduction, the e-mails to Carly arrived between 9:00 and 9:55
last night.  By clue 1, the shortest interval between e-mails was 8 mins.
By clue 3, then, the e-mail from the friend who has msn.com as a mail address,
which arrived at 9:50, must be the last one, since the earliest one after
that would be at 9:58, too late given the intro.  In clue 7, 4 different
e-mails are given.  Since the friend who e-mailed about math homework isn't
the one who uses msn.com (clue 3), none of the four in clue 7 can be the girl
who uses msn.com.  By clue 7, then, two arrangements are possible:
the friend whose SID is sweetsound sent the 1st e-mail and Jenny sent
the 3rd, or Jenny sent the 1st and sweetsound sent the 3rd.  Trying the
first arrangement, sweetsound would have sent the 1st e-mail, the girl who
e-mailed about the homework would have sent the 2nd, Jenny would have
e-mailed Carly 3rd, and the girl who uses yahoo.com as a mail address would
have sent the 4th.  By clue 8, lilone's e-mail to Carly was followed 16 mins.
later by Emily's.  If lilone were Jenny's SID and Emily had sent the 4th
e-mail 16 mins. later, by clue 7, the time between sweetsound's e-mail and
that of the friend asking about homework would be 32 mins.  Adding these
two differences to the minimum of 8 mins. (1) and 9 mins. (6), we get 65 mins.
impossible given the last e-mail was at 9:50.  If lilone were @yahoo.com and
Emily @msn.com, then lilone's e-mail would have come at 9:34.  One interval
between e-mails is 8 mins. (1) and another 9 (6).  Therefore, the three
remaining intervals before 9:34 would be 8, 9, and double either 8 or 9, given clue 7: 8, 9, 16
mins. or 8, 9, 18 mins.  Since the second adds to 35 and would take us
back to 8:59 from 9:34, we need try only the first: Jenny's e-mail would
have been 8 mins. before lilone's at 9:26, the one from the friend asking
about homework would have been 9 mins. before Jenny's, at 9:17, and
sweetsound's would have arrived at 9:01.  By clue 6, Jenny would have
e-mailed about the upcoming dance.  By clue 4, the time between Alicia's
e-mail and that of the friend telling Carly to watch the TV show at 10
was twice that of the time between the e-mail of the friend who uses
comcast.com and the girl talking about the upcoming TV show.  Trying all the
possibilities with Alicia's e-mail at 9:01, we have these numbers for the
(a) comcast.com e-mail, (b) the TV show e-mail, (c) the interval from Alicia's
e-mail to the TV show e-mail, and (d) the interval from the comcast.com e-mail
to the TV show e-mail:  9:17, 9:34, 33 mins., 17 mins.; 9:17, 9:50, 49 mins.,
33 mins; 9:26, 9:34, 33 mins., 8 mins.; 9:26, 9:50, 49 mins, 24 mins.  None
of these numbers satisfies clue 4.  Trying all the possibilities with Alicia's
e-mail at 9:17, we have these numbers for the (a) comcast.com e-mail, (b) the
TV show e-mail, (c) the interval from Alicia's e-mail to the TV show e-mail,
and (d) the interval from the comcast.com e-mail to the TV show e-mail:
9:26, 9:34, 17 mins., 8 mins.; 9:26, 9:50, 33 mins, 24 mins.  Neither of these
numbers satisfies clue 4.  So, since clue 4 cannot work, arrangement 1 fails
and we have arrangement 2 of clue 7:  Jenny sent the 1st e-mail, the girl who
uses yahoo.com for her mail sent the 2nd, sweetsound e-mailed 3rd, and the
friend with the homework question e-mailed 4th.  By clue 8, the interval
between lilone's and Emily's e-mails was 16 mins.  If Jenny were lilone and
Emily had yahoo.com as a mail address, by clue 7, the time between sweetsound's
e-mail and the one about homework would have been 32 mins.  However, summing
with the minimum of 8 mins. (1) and 9 mins. (6), we get 65 mins. from 1st to
5th e-mail, impossible since the 1st would be at 8:45.  If lilone used yahoo.com
and Emily's SID were sweetsound, their e-mails would have been 16 mins. apart
(8).  We have other intervals between e-mails of 8 (1) and 9 (6) mins. in
length.  Therefore, the three intervals must be 8, 9, and double either 8 or 9,
given clue 7: 8, 9, 16 mins. or 8, 9, 18 mins.  Since the second adds to 35 and
we have only 34 mins available (9:50 - 16 mins between lilone and Emily,
we need try only the first:  the interval between the 1st and 2nd e-mail
would be 8 mins. and the interval between the 3rd and 4th intervals would
be 16 mins., with the time between the 4th and 5th then the 9 mins. with
the girl inquiring about the upcoming dance having msn.com as a mailing
address--no (6).  Therefore, lilone sent the 4th e-mail and Emily the
5th, with lilone's at 9:34 (8).  By clue 4, Emily had to e-mail about the
TV show.  If the friend who e-mailed about the dance in clue 6 were the one
who had yahoo.com as an address and the interval between the 1st and 2nd
e-mails was 9 mins., then by clue 7, the interval between the 3rd and 4th
would be 18 mins.  Summing, however, we get 9+18, a total of 27 and
leaving only 7 mins for the other interval, contradicting clue 1.  So,
the dance e-mail was the 3rd one, following the 2nd by 9 mins.  By clues 1
and 7, then, the interval between the 1st (Jenny's) and 2nd e-mails was 8
mins. and between the 3rd and 4th 16 mins.; the 3rd e-mail came at 9:18,
the 2nd at 9:09, and the 1st at 9:01.  By clue 4, the time between Alicia's
e-mail and that of the friend telling Carly to watch the TV show at 10
was twice that of the time between the e-mail of the friend who uses
comcast.com and the girl talking about the upcoming TV show.  If Alicia
had sent the 2nd e-mail at 9:09, her interval to the TV show one would
have been 41 mins; neither the comcast.com e-mail at 9:18 (32 min. interval)
nor 9:34 (16 min. interval) satisfies clue 4.  Alicia sent the 3rd e-mail
and the girl with comcast.com as an address sent the 4th.  By clue 5, Marci
sent the 2nd e-mail, about the new music video, and Alicia uses aol.com.
By elimination, Jenny's e-mail, from juno.com, was gossip,, and Tara sent
the 4th e-mail.  By clue 9, Marci's SID is volleyballr.  Jenny's SID is
cheer1 and Emily's justinfan (2).  In sum, the five e-mails arrived as
follows:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> 9:01 - Jenny, cheer1@juno.com, gossip<BR>
<LI> 9:09 - Marci, volleyballr@yahoo.com, video<BR>
<LI> 9:18 - Alicia, sweetsound@aol.com, dance<BR>
<LI> 9:34 - Tara, lilone@comcast.com, homework<BR>
<LI> 9:50 - Emily, justinfan@msn.com, TV show<BR>
