 <tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="insP"><tr><td>Last Friday, the pre-schoolers at Little People Daycare Center played the Cupcake
Walk, in which they paraded around a big circle while a tune played on the
tape player; when the music was stopped at random, the child who was nearest the
place on the circle where a plate of cupcakes sat won the cupcakes.  The children
played five rounds of Cupcake Walk; each walk had a different winner, each dozen
cupcakes had a different icing, and a different song played for each of the five
walks, with "Old MacDonald Had a Farm" the tune for one.  At the end of the game,
the five winners, including Ben, shared their prizes with the other daycare children.
Given the clues below, can you find which child won each round 1st-5th, the type of
icing on the cupcakes he won, and the tune that played during his or her winning walk?
<P>
<OL>
<LI> Christopher won an earlier round than the preschooler who won the M & M's
cupcakes, while the M & M's winner won the Cupcake Walk immediately before
the one where "The Ants Go Marching" was played.
<LI> The chocolate chip cupcakes weren't the ones given as a prize for the walk
taken to "The Wheels on the Bus."
<LI> Neither Megan nor Tess is the child who won the cupcakes with strawberry icing.
<LI> Jenny won the Cupcake Walk that was played immediately before the round during
which "The Wheels on the Bus" was the walking tune.
<LI> The prize for the "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star" walk wasn't the M & M's
cupcakes.
<LI> The rainbow sprinkle cupcakes weren't won by the child who was closest to the
prize when "Itsy-Bitsy Spider" stopped playing.
<LI> Christopher, who didn't get the Reese's Pieces cupcakes as his prize, didn't
win the round during which "The Wheels on the Bus" was the marching tune.
<LI> The walk taken immediately after the one during which "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little
Star" was the song was the one for which the chocolate chip icing cupcakes
were given away.
<LI> Jenny's winning walk didn't come to the tune of "The Ants Go Marching."
<LI> The preschooler who won the round during which "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star"
was played isn't Tess.
<LI> The rainbow sprinkle cupcakes were the prize in the walk immediately before the
one where the Reese's Pieces cupcakes were awarded; the Reese's Pieces cupcakes
weren't the ones given to the winner of the 5th and last Cupcake Walk.
