 <tr><td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="insP"><tr><td>From the introduction, the Elvis sightings occurred on five different days
during the month of Asimova; while by clue 7, the first sighting occurred
on the 8th and the last on the 22nd, a span of 14 days.  By clue 3, the
sighting on the planet Landograce was 10 days before the Elvis "appearance"
reported by the <I>Weekly Planet</I>; while by clue 5, the sighting of
Elvis as a short order cook at the Fried Sananab Grill occurred 5 days before
the sighting reported in <I>Galaxy</I>.  The report of Elvis as the
short order cook couldn't have been in the <I>Weekly Planet</I>, or there
would be 15 days between the Landograce sighting and the one appearing in
<I>Galaxy</I> (clues 3, 5), contradicting clue 7; nor could the Landograce
sighting be the one reported in <I>Galaxy</I>, for the same reason.  So, if
there were overlap between clues 3 and 5, the sighting of Elvis as a short
order cook would have happened on Landograce.  Combining the two clues, then,
the report in <I>Galaxy</I> would have been of a sighting 5 days later and
the one in the <I>Weekly Planet</I> 10 days later than the one on Landograce.
By clue 1, the sighting reported in <I>News of the Milky Way</I> occurred
4 days before Elvis was spotted playing the Ratiug in a skiffle band and
12 days before the King was seen on the planet Upleto.  Given the possible
overlap between clues 3 and 5, the sighting on Landograce couldn't have been
in <I>News of the Milky Way</I> or the fourth sighting of Elvis in a skiffle
band would have been 4 days later and the fifth sighting would have been on
Upleto 12 days later--the gap of 14 days given in clue 7 would not work.
So, the <I>News of the Milky Way</I> report would be the fourth to the three
mentioned above.  Either or both of the sightings of Elvis playing the
Ratiug and of Elvis on Upleto would then be in <I>Galaxy</I> and/or the
<I>Weekly Planet</I> in some order.  If the Ratiug report were in
<I>Galaxy</I>, combining clues 1, 3, and 5, the Landograce sighting would
have occurred 1 day before that in <I>News of the Milky Way</I>, as well
as 5 before the <I>Galaxy</I> report and 10 before the <I>Weekly Planet</I>
one, and only 13 days before the sighting on Upleto--again contradicting clue
7.  If the Ratiug story had been in the <I>Weekly Planet</I>, the sighting
in the <I>News of the Milky Way</I> would have been 6 days after the one
on Landograce and the one on Upleto 18 days after the one on Landograce,
contradicting clue 7.  If the sighting on Upleto were the overlap between clue
1 and the arrangement being tested in clues 3 and 5, the Upleto sighting wouldn't
be in <I>Galaxy</I>, since the interval between the <I>News of the Milky
Way</I> and <I>Weekly Planet</I> reports would be 17 days, conflicting with
clue 7.  If the Upleto report were in the <I>Weekly Planet</I>, then the
<I>News</I> report would be 2 days before the Landograce one and the Ratiug
sighting would be 2 days after the Landograce one--but the interval from
first to last sighting would only be 12 days--no (7).  Therefore, there is
no way that the sighting of Elvis cooking at the Fried Sananab Grill can be
the one on Landograce; and four different sightings are given in clues 3 and
5.  Since three sightings are mentioned in clue 1, at least two of them must
overlap the four in clues 3 and 5.  If the report in the <I>News of the Milky
Way</I> were of the Landograce sighting, then the sighting of Elvis playing
the Ratiug would have been 4 days later (1), the sighting on Upleto would have
been 12 days later (1), and the sighting reported in the <I>Weekly Planet</I>
would have been 10 days later (3).  If the Ratiug sighting were in the
<I>Galaxy</I>, then the sighting of Elvis working as a short order cook would
have been 1 day before the Landograce report--but the longest gap of 13 days
contradicts clue 7.  If the Upleto sighting were the one in <I>Galaxy</I>,
the Elvis-as-cook sighting would have been 7 days after the Landograce one,
and the longest interval of 12 days wouldn't satisfy clue 7.  If the report
of Elvis as a cook had been on Upleto, the <I>Galaxy</I> report would have
been 17 days after the Landograce one, again contradicting clue 7.  If the
<I>News of the Milky Way</I> story had been the one about Elvis working as a
short order cook, then the <I>Galaxy</I> sighting would have been 5 (5),
the Ratiug sighting 4 (1), and the Upleto sighting 12 (1) days after the
cook report.  The Upleto sighting couldn't be the one in the <I>Planet</I>,
since the Landograce report then would be 2 days after the cook report and
the longest interval would be 12 days--no (7).  If the Ratiug sighting then
were on Landograce, by clue 3, the sighting reported in the <I>Weekly
Planet</I> would be 14 days after the cook report--but there is no 3-day
interval as specified in clue 6. If the Ratiug sighting had been on Landograce,
it would have been 6 days before the sighting of Elvis as a cook; but there
then would be a 16 day span between sightings, conflicting with clue 7.  So, the
<I>News of the Milky Way</I> isn't reporting the sighting of Elvis as a short
order cook; the <I>News</I> sighting is the fifth to the four in clues 3 and 5.
If the Upleto story in clue 1 were in the <I>Weekly Planet</I>, then it would be
12 days after the report in the <I>News</I> (1), with the Landograce sighting 2
days after the report in the <I>News</I> (5) and the sighting of Elvis in the
skiffle band 4 days after the <I>News</I> sighting.  The latter would have to be
in the <I>Galaxy</I>, so that the sighting of Elvis cooking would have been 1 day
before the sighting reported in the <I>News</I>.  However, the longest time
between sightings is 13 days, contradicting clue 7.  If the Elvis-as-cook
sighting were on Upleto, then by clue 1, it would have happened 12 days after
the sighting reported in the <I>News of the Milky Way</I>, with the
<I>Galaxy</I> sighting then 17 days after that in the <I>News</I> (5)--no (7).
Therefore, <I>Galaxy</I> reported that Elvis was seen on the planet Upleto,
12 days after the sighting reported in the <I>News of the Milky Way</I> (1).
The Ratiug report was 4 days after the sighting in the <I>News</I>; and, by
clue 5, the cook report was 7 days after the <I>News</I> one.  If the
Ratiug sighting were in the <I>Weekly Planet</I>, by clue 3, the Landograce
sighting would have been 6 days before that in the <I>News</I>--but the
time from the Landograce sighting to the Upleto one would have been 18 days,
contradicting clue 7.  So, the Ratiug sighting was on Landograce, and the
sighting reported in the <I>Weekly Planet</I> occurred 14 days after the one
reported in the <I>News of the Milky Way</I>.  Translating what we know to the
actual dates in clue 7, the sighting in the <I>News of the Milky Way</I> was
on 8, that on Landograce was on 12, the one of Elvis cooking was on 15, the
one on Upleto reported by <I>Galaxy</I. was on 20, and the one in the
<I>Weekly Planet</I> was on 22 Asimova.  By clue 6, the Landograce sighting
was in the <I>Universal Enquirer</I>, with the 15 Asimova sighting on the
planet Revenrowon, by elimination reported in <I>Orbit</I>.  By clue 2, the
22 Asimova sighting was on the planet iiBluaweha; so the 8 Asimova Elvis
sighting was on Casprilli.  By clue 4, the Casprilli sighting was of Elvis
driving a Pink Taxillac.  By clue 2, the iiBluaweha sighting was of Elvis
as a guard at the planet's Rock Jailhouse, with the Upleto sighting being of
Elvis as a platinum miner.  In sum, the Elvis sightings reported in the
galactic tabloids are as follows:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>  8 Asimova, <I>News of the Milky Way</I> reported Elvis driving a
Pink Taxillac on Casprilli<BR>
<LI> 12 Asimova, the <I>Universal Enquirer</I> reported Elvis playing Ratiug

Upleto<BR>
