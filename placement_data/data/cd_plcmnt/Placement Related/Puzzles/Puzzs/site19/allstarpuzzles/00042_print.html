the Conemaugh County 2003 Calendar, which features a picture of a local
landmark taken in a different county community--one in Fallbrook--by a
different local photographer--one by Chris Archer--on each of the
January-December pages.  Given the data below, can you decide each
month's landmark, where it is located, and who contributed its picture
to the calendar?
