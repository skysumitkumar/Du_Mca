<font face="Verdana" size="2">
 Laptop computers differ from full size machines in many important ways, not the
 least of which is expense. Spend your money wisely, learn both what to look for when purchasing a laptop computer
 and ownership tips and guidelines.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Purchasing:</b> The purchasing advice focuses on issues specific to laptops.
We start with the pros/cons of a laptop and an overview of the various types of
laptops (including ruggedized). Then we cover return policies, prices, buying
new vs. refurbished and warranty advice. On the hardware side, the class covers
issues specific to laptops regarding RAM, the hard disk, the processor and a lot
about LCD screens. The topic ends with an overview of 20 other features relevant
to a new laptop computer. The mantra of the class is &quot;Only buy a laptop computer that you can return
for a full refund&quot;. There are many reasons for this, come hear them for
yourself.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p>

<font face="Verdana" size="2">
 <b>Owning: </b>The ownership tips include testing the hardware in your new
 laptop, caring for and adjusting the LCD screen, dealing with heat and portable surge
 protectors. If your main computer is a desktop and you only use a laptop for
 traveling, we discuss a number of ways to configure your email so it's
 available on both machines. Perhaps the biggest ownership issue is
 just keeping the computer, laptops are stolen more often than desktops. Learn
 about the best data backup options for laptop computers so you don't lose your
 data along with the machine. We also cover preventing the theft in the first
 place, how to secure the computer so that if it is stolen no one can access
 Windows or your files and software to aid in recovering the computer after a
 theft.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The class ends with a <i>Gizmos</i> topic briefly
reviewing over 20 useful gadgets for use with a laptop computer. Among them,
add-on sound cards and stereo speakers, portable printers,
devices for plugging the laptop into the cigarette lighter in a car, portable
wireless routers, flash memory card readers, external batteries, webcams and
scanners.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"> Students receive a 60 page handout so they can listen rather than take notes
 during the class.<br>
The class is three to four hours. There are no pre-requisites for the
class.&nbsp; <a href="#links">Related links</a> are below.&nbsp;</font></p>

 two favorite ultra-light laptops. He called the Toshiba Protégé R100 &quot;the
 most spectacular ultralight machine ever built&quot;. It sells for about
 $2,300. Cheaper and almost as good is the Sharp Actius MM10 which sells for
 under $1,500 (prices as of November 2003). The first machine is&nbsp; 2.4
 pounds, the latter 2.1.</li>
