Recall --<P>Last week, Gazette Reader Jenny C. asked if I knew of a freeware greeting card program. She wrote:</p> <I> <P>&quot; I am wondering if you could help me: I have been trying to find a small (and hopefully free) software program to create ordinary greeting cards -- one that I can put my own pictures or clipart on, write my own verse, and mail it (via snail mail) to friends. I used to use a greeting card program that came pre-packaged with my computer, but the program has expired and I can no longer use it. I would love to make my own greeting cards and I am sure other subscribers would too. Any ideas? &quot;</p> </I> <P>I didn't have any freebee suggestions off hand, so I asked Readers for their picks. Die Hard Gazette Reader 'Gail from Houston' writes:</p> <I> <P>
&quot; I don't know of any freeware greeting cards to use but you can use Microsoft Word, free clipart, and heavy card stock (for printing pictures on your printer) to construct a card. I'm a cheapo too, right now, especially since I'm in grad school and can't afford any extras. Here's how I've printed a card:</p>
<p>First, use plain paper where the artwork and type would go by folding an 8x10 sheet in half and in half again (make it look like a card). 
Following that, place the picture in the bottom right corner; in the top left corner (upside down), 
place the inside type. Use the Word rulers to measure off where to precisely place the picture, print it off, then put the paper in upside down for the inside type. My only complaint is that it isn't as large as I think it should be but, heck, you can always buy larger card stock. You can also use larger plain paper (the 14-inch length) and print your card. Also, you can print a card in any shape; it doesn't even have to be folded. 
&quot;</p>
</I> <P>Ellen F. and a few other Readers suggested FreeCard from PCWW.com. From the web site:</p> <I> <P>&quot; FreeCard lets you create electronic greeting cards with graphics or video, text, music and sound to send with e-mail or on diskettes. Greeting cards are made into Windows executable files and they expand, play, and clean up automatically on target PCs. A Watermarking utility is included for embedding identifying and linking information to your graphics and video materials. &quot;</p> <P><a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.pcww.com/web_mat/freecard.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.pcww.com/web_mat/freecard.html'" tppabs="http://www.pcww.com/web_mat/freecard.html"> http://www.pcww.com/web_mat/freecard.html</a></p> </I> <P>Carol X. and a few others recommended PrintFree.com:</p> <I> <P>&quot; In response to Jenny C., PrintFree.com provides many links which allow you to print free greeting cards. I've enjoyed using the site very much, and I think your Readers will, too. From the web site: 'PrintFree.com provides many useful items which allow you to print for only the cost of paper and ink.

<p>Most CD burning applications are loaded with tons of techno-jargon that 
confuse most computer users (let alone, newbies). And with a plethora of CD 
formats, creating a CD -- whether it's an audio CD for your car, or a data CD 
for your computer -- can certainly prove to be a difficult task. Thankfully, 
there's a much easier solution (and you don't need to be a rocket scientist to 
use it)!</p>
