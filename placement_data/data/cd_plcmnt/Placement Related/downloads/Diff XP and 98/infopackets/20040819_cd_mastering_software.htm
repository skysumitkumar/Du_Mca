Since writing this newsletter, I have received a number of questions with respect to burning CD recordable discs. One question came from Gazette Reader Bob T., who recently asked how it was possible to transport movie files from his computer onto his DVD player. Bob writes:<I> <P>&quot; Dennis, I have a number of .MPEG movie files that I've downloaded through Kazaa. Friends tell me it is possible to play these files using my DVD player, but I need special CD burning software to do it. Is this true? If so, what program do you recommend? &quot;</p> </I> <P>And Gazette Reader Sheila S. asked how to transfer .MP3 files onto CD using two different types of media formats:</p> <I> <P>&quot; My daughter has downloaded a ton of music files to my C drive. I want to archive these files over to CD in order to reclaim space. I also read somewhere that the .MP3 files need to be converted before they can be played in a CD player. Do I have to convert each .MP3 file before I can save them to CD? &quot;</p> </I> <P>And finally, Gazette Reader Alberta W. asked how it was possible to transfer recipe files over to CD-R. She writes:</p> <I> <P>&quot; I would like to backup files from my hard drive to a blank CD recordable disc. Can you tell me how to do it? I have a folder set aside on my computer full of recipes, but don't know what to do in order to get the files moved onto CD-R. What do you suggest? &quot;</p> </I> <P><B>My response</B>:</P> <P>All of the questions set forth by our Readers vary greatly from one another, and yet, they all involve the same thing -- namely: burning a CD.</p> <P>Many recording applications that come standard with CD burners are enough to conquer the 'basics' of CD burning, but certainly, not all applications are created equal.</p> <P>To meet the requirements set forth by our Readers, one might seek a more specific application engineered specifically for an 'all-in-one' approach, called CD Mastering Software.</p> <P>Unlike 'run-of-the-mill' recording applications, CD mastering software is unique because it not only provides features which are absent from basic CD burning applications, but also provides the means to create CDs using a multitude of media formats.</p> <P>Nero Burning ROM Ultra Edition 6 and Easy CD Creator (now called &quot;Easy Media Creator 7&quot;) are well-known CD Mastering applications. Both programs are jam-packed full of features and are more than capable of meeting our criteria. The caveat, however, is that both applications are pricey (retailing at the $99 dollar mark). And, although both programs provide an 'all-in-one' solution, mastering the software itself can prove to be disenchanting, especially for newbies.</p> <P><B>Exploring Alternative Solutions</B></P> <P> <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&q=freeware+cd+burner+mp3+wav+copy+svcd+vcd&meta=  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&q=freeware+cd+burner+mp3+wav+copy+svcd+vcd&meta='" tppabs="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&q=freeware+cd+burner+mp3+wav+copy+svcd+vcd&meta=">Scouring the Internet</a> for a freeware alternative can often lead to a dead end -- especially since many &quot;free&quot; solutions today either come bundled with unwanted piggy-back advertising software, or just plain fail to meet the perquisites proposed by our Readers.</p> <P><B>Finding a Middle Ground</B></P> <P>Because Nero Burning ROM and Easy CD / Media Creator set such a high standard, finding a single application that is as equally impressive and feature-packed proved to be a difficult task. My search for such an application came to a halt, however, when I came across &quot;CD Recording Suite 4&quot; by Ashampoo.</p> <P>

Ashampoo CD Recording Suite is newbie-friendly because it uses a familiar Windows Explorer-style interface.<br> &nbsp;</li> <li>Burn Files and Folders: Since Ashampoo CD Recording Suite produces &quot;multi session&quot; CDs, you can add more files to your CD at a later time. This feature makes Ashampoo CD Recording Suite ideal for anyone who needs to make occasional backups of important data.<br> &nbsp;</li> <li> Burn Music CDs: Copy a Music CD from one disc to another; create standard music CDs (playable in a regular CD player, such as home or car stereo), or create .MP3 CDs (playable in .MP3 CD players or on the computer). Ashampoo CD Recording Suite burns .WAV, .MP3, .FLAC and Ogg Vorbis files *directly* to audio CD format without the need for confusing &quot;plug-in&quot; software often required by other CD burning applications.<br> &nbsp;</li> <li>Burn Movie CDs: Copy movie CDs (playable on the computer), burn movies as a Video CD [VCD] or Super Video CD [SVCD] (playable on most DVD players). Note that VCD discs are only compatible with .MPEG movie files, and not .AVI, for example.<br> &nbsp;</li> <li>Create and burn CD Images: supports .ashdisc, .CUE/BIN, and .ISO image files. CD images are typically downloaded from the Internet and are often 1 file. Burning a CD image onto disc is similar to copying an entire CD, without the need to copy 'file by file'.<br> &nbsp;</li> <li>Copy a CD: Copy and format CD from one disc to another.<br> &nbsp;</li> <li>Other features include: Set automatic burn speed; support for file names with up to 64 characters (including spaces); load and save project files, and Erase CD-RWs. Plus much more!</li> </ul> <P><b>
