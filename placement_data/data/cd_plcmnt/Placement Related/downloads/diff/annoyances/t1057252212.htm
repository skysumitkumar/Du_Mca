Windows XP is built on NT technology and is just an upgrade to windows 2000. They 
are identical at the roots but only the layout and visual styles are different

Hi, 32 bit file system, bigger drive's suport, 98 is better than 95 by far oh and 
not to forget USB device suport and you don't need to load in dos drivers to see 
all your device's in 98 etc.etc.

Win98 has superior multitasking and threading capabilities, FAT32 drive support (Win95 
with Fat16 can only create 2GB partitions, Win98/Fat32 can create 128GB partitions), 
native USB support (also native I-1394 FireWire support in Win98SE), most Windows 
software and hardware sold in retail stores even today supports Win98 (more support 
for Win98SE) but not Win95, latest applications of DirectX (9.0) and Internet Explorer 
(IE6 SP1) will run in 98 but not 95 (95 stops at Direct x 8.0 and IE 5.5 SP2), etc....

Difference between win 98 and win xp
1. windows 98 supports FAT16,32 and windows xp supports fat 16,32 and ntfs .
2.using fat 32 we can create partition 128 GB but we can not give security to file 
and folder like we can not implement disk quta (disk quta is used to limit space 
in hard disk for a particular user ).but windows xp support ntfs .here we can give 
more security to file and folder . using ntfs we can encrypt ,decrypt,compress,decompress 
in windows xp.
3.windows 98 supports networking. it can serve as server and workstation but there 
is a problem in 98 networking .we can not give security permission to resources. 
using windows 98 networking we can share resources and we have to go for peer to 
peer networking (in peer to peer networking we can share resources but we can not 
give secutity.we can connect 10 -15 node ). but xp supports server side networking 
we can give security in xp .there is seperate version for server and client.
4.windows 98 is slower than windows xp but windows 98 is easy to use .windows xp 
have much complexity to use it .
5.Both 98 and xp support internet but for net purpose windows xp is excelent.
6.window 98 is cheaper than windows xp.
7.xp color management is good than windows 98.xp supports 256 bit true color.
8.For home uses windows 98 is better than windows xp.xp better supports game than 
windows 98.
9.windows 98 can support as server as well as client but in windows xp we have separate 
version for client and server. 
10.windows 98 we have to install every device (like mouse,keybord,sound card) but 
windows xp it will be installed automatically. it supports plug and play device

I have had nothing but trouble with xp. Everytime I try to play Half Life I get a 
message about compatibilty problems. Same with Nero. I try patches but to no avail. 
I am actually thinking of doing a clean install of Win98Se on a computer that is 
not even a month old yet. I don't know
