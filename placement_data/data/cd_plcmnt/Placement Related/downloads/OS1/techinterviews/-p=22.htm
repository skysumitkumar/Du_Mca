			<ol>
<li> Explain why &amp; how a MOSFET works</li>
<a id="more-22"></a>
<li> Draw Vds-Ids curve for a MOSFET. Now, show how this curve changes (a) with increasing Vgs (b) with increasing transistor width (c) considering Channel Length Modulation</li>
	<li> Explain the various MOSFET Capacitances &amp; their significance</li>
	<li> Draw a CMOS Inverter. Explain its transfer characteristics</li>
	<li> Explain sizing of the inverter </li>
	<li>How do you size NMOS and PMOS transistors to increase the threshold voltage?</li>
	<li> What is Noise Margin? Explain the procedure to determine Noise Margin</li>
	<li> Give the expression for CMOS switching power dissipation</li>
	<li> What is Body Effect? </li>
	<li> Describe the various effects of scaling </li>
	<li> Give the expression for calculating Delay in CMOS circuit</li>
	<li> What happens to delay if you increase load capacitance?</li>
	<li> What happens to delay if we include a resistance at the output of a CMOS circuit? </li>
	<li> What are the limitations in increasing the power supply to reduce delay? </li>
	<li> How does Resistance of the metal lines vary with increasing thickness and increasing length? </li>
	<li> You have three adjacent parallel metal lines. Two out of phase signals pass through the outer two metal lines. Draw the waveforms in the center metal line due to interference. Now, draw the signals if the signals in outer metal lines are in phase with each other</li>
	<li> What happens if we increase the number of contacts or via from one metal layer to the next? </li>
	<li> Draw a transistor level two input NAND gate. Explain its sizing (a) considering Vth (b) for equal rise and fall times </li>
	<li> Let A &amp; B be two inputs of the NAND gate. Say signal A arrives at the NAND gate later than signal B. To optimize delay, of the two series NMOS inputs A &amp; B, which one would you place near the output? </li>
	<li> Draw the stick diagram of a NOR gate. Optimize it </li>
	<li> For CMOS logic, give the various techniques you know to minimize power consumption </li>
	<li> What is Charge Sharing? Explain the Charge Sharing problem while sampling data from a Bus </li>
	<li> Why do we gradually increase the size of inverters in buffer design? Why not give the output of a circuit to one large inverter? </li>
	<li> In the design of a large inverter, why do we prefer to connect small transistors in parallel (thus increasing effective width) rather than lay out one transistor with large width? </li>
	<li> Given a layout, draw its transistor level circuit. (I was given a 3 input AND gate and a 2 input Multiplexer. You can expect any simple 2 or 3 input gates)</li>
	<li> Give the logic expression for an AOI gate. Draw its transistor level equivalent. Draw its stick diagram </li>
	<li> Why don&#8217;t we use just one NMOS or PMOS transistor as a transmission gate? </li>
	<li> For a NMOS transistor acting as a pass transistor, say the gate is connected to VDD, give the output for a square pulse input going from 0 to VDD </li>
	<li> Draw a 6-T SRAM Cell and explain the Read and Write operations </li>
	<li> Draw the Differential Sense Amplifier and explain its working. Any idea how to size this circuit? (Consider Channel Length Modulation) </li>
	<li> What happens if we use an Inverter instead of the Differential Sense Amplifier? </li>
	<li> Draw the SRAM Write Circuitry </li>
	<li> Approximately, what were the sizes of your transistors in the SRAM cell? How did you arrive at those sizes? </li>
	<li> How does the size of PMOS Pull Up transistors (for bit &amp; bit- lines) affect SRAM&#8217;s performance? </li>

		<p>Q14: Dynamic Power dissipation increases.<br />
Q15: Resistance is directly propotional to length and inversly propotional to area.So higher metals has lesser resistance.Increasing L increases the resistance.<br />
Q17:Increase in contact resistance.<br />
Q27:NMOS passes clean zero and a bad one while PMOS passes clean 1 and bad zero(Hint:Vt loss)<br />
Q42:Paratic Tx act as tyristors.Chances of triggering this thyristor.<br />
Put sufficient well contacts.

		<p>answer for 19 th question:<br />
  connect b signal to the transistor(mos) which is nearer to the supply,bec it will reduces the charge sharing problem between the source of one Txr and drain of another Txr.the reason for the charge sharing is that the capacitance formed between the two layers</p>
