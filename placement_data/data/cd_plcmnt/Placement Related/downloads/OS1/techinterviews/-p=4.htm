		<h3><a href="-p=4.htm" tppabs="http://www.techinterviews.com/?p=4" rel="bookmark" title="Interview questions: Visual Basic">Visual Basic</a></h3>
			<ol>
	<li><b>How do you register a component?</b> <i>Expected answer:</i> Compiling the component, running REGSVR32 MyDLL.dll<a id="more-4"></a>
	<li><b>Name and explain the different compatibility types when creating a COM component.</b> <i>Expected answer:</i> No Compatibility ? New GUID created, references from other components will not workProject Compatibility ? Default for a new component &lt;Not as critical to mention this one&gt;Binary Compatibility ? GUID does not change, references from other components will work
	<li><b>Why iss it important to use source control software for source code?</b> <i>Expected answer:</i> Modification history.Code ownership: Multiple people can not modify the same code at the same time.
	<li><b>What two methods are called from the ObjectContext object to inform MTS that the transaction was successful or unsuccessful?</b> <i>Expected answer:</i> SetComplete and SetAbort.
	<li><b>What is the tool used to configure the port range and protocols for DCOM communications?</b> <i>Expected answer:</i> DCOMCONFIG.EXE
	<li><b>What does Option Explicit refer to?</b> <i>Expected answer:</i> All variables must be declared before use. Their type is not required.
	<li><b>What are the different ways to Declare and Instantiate an object in Visual Basic 6?</b> <i>Expected answer:</i> Dim obj as OBJ.CLASS with eitherSet obj = New OBJ.CLASS orSet obj = CreateObject(?OBJ.CLASS?) orSet obj = GetObject( ,? OBJ.CLASS?)orDim obj as New OBJ.CLASS
	<li><b>Name the four different cursor types in ADO and describe them briefly.</b> <i>Expected answer:</i> The cursor types are listed from least to most resource intensive.Forward Only ? Fastest, can only move forward in recordset Static ? Can move to any record in the recordset. Data is static and never changes.KeySet ? Changes are detectable, records that are deleted by other users are unavailable, and records created by other users are not detectedDynamic ? All changes are visible.
	<li><b>Name the four different locking type in ADO and describe them briefly.</b> <i>Expected answer:</i> LockPessimistic ? Locks the row once after any edits occur.LockOptimistic ? Locks the row only when Update is called.LockBatchOptimistic ? Allows Batch Updates.LockReadOnly ? Read only. Can not alter the data.
	<li><b>Describe Database Connection pooling (relative to MTS )</b> <i>Expected answer:</i> This allows MTS to reuse database connections. Database connections are put to ?sleep? as opposed to being created and destroyed and are activated upon request.
	<li><b>What are the ADO objects? Explain them. Provide a scenario using three of them to return data from a database.</b> <i>Expected answer:</i> Connection ? Connects to a data source; contains the Errors collectionCommand ? Executes commands to the data source. Is the only object that can accept parameters for a stored procedure.Recordset ? The set of data returned from the database.Scenario: There are many possibilities. The most likely is as follows:Dim conn As ADODB.ConnectionDim rs As ADODB.RecordsetDim Cmd As ADODB.Commandconn.ConnectionString = ?CONNECTION STRING?conn.OpenSet Cmd.ActiveConnection = connCmd.CommandText = ?SQL STATEMENT?Set rs = Cmd.ExecuteSet rs.ActiveConnection = Nothingconn.Close
	<li><b>Under the ADO Command Object, what collection is responsible for input to stored procedures?</b> <i>Expected answer:</i> The Parameters collection.
	<li><b>What are some benefits of using MTS?</b> <i>Expected answer:</i> Database Pooling, Transactional operations, Deployment, Security, Remote Execution.
	<li><b>What is the benefit of wrapping database calls into MTS transactions?</b> <i>Expected answer:</i> If database calls are made within the context of a transaction, aborting the transaction will undo and changes that occur within that transaction. This removes the possibility of stranded, or partial data.
	<li><b>Describe and In Process vs. Out of Process component. Which is faster?</b>  <i>Expected answer:</i>An in-process component is implemented as a DLL, and runs in the same process space as its client app, enabling the most efficient communication between client and component.Each client app that uses the component starts a new instance of it.An out of process component is implemented as an EXE, and unlike a dll, runs in its own process space. As a result, exe&#8217;s are slower then dll&#8217;s because communications between client and component must be marshalled across process boundaries. A single instance of an out of process component can service many clients.
	<li><b>What are the main components of the ADO object model?

		<p>Q : What is the need of zorder method?<br />
Ans : Three graphical layers are associated with forms and containers. The back layer is the drawing space where the results of the graphics methods are displayed. Next is the middle layer where graphical objects and Label controls are displayed. The front layer is where all nongraphical controls like CommandButton, CheckBox, or ListBox are displayed. Anything contained in a layer closer to the front covers anything contained in the layer(s) behind it. ZOrder arranges objects only within the layer where the object is displayed.

		<p>What is the difference between and Interface and an Abstract Class?</p>
	<p>While this topic is probably more popular amongst Java or .NET peeps, don&#8217;t be surpised if asked in an interview.</p>
	<p>An Interface basically is a contract which defines the factors (properties and methods) that a class must provide. However the interface does not specify how these factors are to be implemented.</p>
	<p>An abstract class is similar to an interface in that it defines empty properties and methods but may include some methods and properties which are already implemented.</p>
	<p>Functionally in VB6 they are pretty much the same. You can create standard interfaces by compiling abstract classes in Visual Basic ActiveX DLLs or EXEs, or with the MkTypLib utility. In order to implement an interface, you must use the References dialog box to set a reference to the type library or ActiveX DLL or EXE. In similar fashion, any application that uses objects which have implemented an abstract interface must also have a reference to the type library that describes the interface. Information about implemented interfaces cannot be included in the type libraries of components, because there is no way to resolve naming conflicts.</p>
	<p>VB6 does not support inheritance but provides for using interfaces as a means of class inheritance and extension.

		<p>Q: Early Binding vs Late Binding - define them and explain their pros and cons</p>
	<p>A: Binding refers the object type definition. You are using Early Binding if the object type is specified when declaring your object.  Eg if you Dim myObject as ADODB.Recordset that is early binding. </p>
	<p>If on the other hand you declare your object as a generic type you are late binding. Eg if you Dim myObject as Object.</p>
	<p>On should note that binding is determined at object declaration and not at object instantiation.<br />
Therefore it does not matter if you later go on to Set myObject = New ADODB.Recordset or Set myObject = CreateObject(&#8221;ADODB.Recordset&#8221;).</p>
	<p>Early binding allows developers to interact with the object&#8217;s properties and methods during coding. You can enjoy the benefits of intellisense. Also, early binding permits the compiler to check your code. Errors are caught at compile time. Early binding also results in faster code. It&#8217;s disadvantage is that you cannot create a generic object which may be bound to different types of objects.</p>
	<p>Late binding on the other hand permits defining generic objects which may be bound to different objects. Eg you could declare myControl as Control without knowing which control you will encounter. You could then query the Controls collection and determine which control you are working on using the TypeOf method and branch to the section of your code that provides for that type. This is the only benefit of late binding. It&#8217;s disadvantages are that it is error prone and you will not enjoy much intellisense whilst coding.</p>
	<p>Q: How does Option Explicit affect using late binding?</p>
	<p>A: It doesn&#8217;t! Option Explicit demands that variables are declared prior to being used. The variable type does not have to be defined. In .NET using Option Strict Off will affect late binding.</p>
