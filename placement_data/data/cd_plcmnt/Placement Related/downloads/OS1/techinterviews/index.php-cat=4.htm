<li><b>What is the difference between procedural and object-oriented programs?</b>- a) In procedural program, programming logic follows certain procedures and the instructions are executed one after another. In OOP program, unit of program is object, which is nothing but combination of data and code. b) In procedural program, data is exposed to the whole program whereas in OOPs program, it is accessible with in the object and which in turn assures the security of the code.</li>
	<li><b>What are Encapsulation, Inheritance and Polymorphism?</b>- Encapsulation is the mechanism that binds together code and data it manipulates and keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse. Inheritance is the process by which one object acquires the properties of another object. Polymorphism is the feature that allows one interface to be used for general class actions.</li>
	<li><b>What is the difference between Assignment and Initialization?</b>- Assignment can be done as many times as desired whereas initialization can be done only once.</li>

Delegate request to Bean (Enterprise Bean).</li>
	<li><b>Is it possible to share an HttpSession between a JSP and EJB? What happens when I change a value in the HttpSession from inside an EJB?</b> - You can pass the HttpSession as parameter to an EJB method, only if all objects in session are serializable.This has to be consider as passed-by-value, that means that it&#8217;s read-only in the EJB. If anything is altered from inside the EJB, it won&#8217;t be reflected back to the HttpSession of the Servlet Container.The pass-by-reference can be used between EJBs Remote Interfaces, as they are remote references. While it <b>is</b> possible to pass an HttpSession as a parameter to an EJB object, it is considered to be bad practice in terms of object-oriented design. This is because you are creating an unnecessary coupling between back-end objects (EJBs) and front-end objects (HttpSession). Create a higher-level of abstraction for your EJBs API. Rather than passing the whole, fat, HttpSession (which carries with it a bunch of http semantics), create a class that acts as a value object (or structure) that holds all the data you need to pass back and forth between front-end/back-end. Consider the case where your EJB needs to support a non HTTP-based client. This higher level of abstraction will be flexible enough to support it.</li>

<li><b> Can we use the constructor, instead of init(), to initialize servlet? </b> - Yes , of course you can use the constructor instead of init(). There&#8217;s nothing to stop you. But you shouldn&#8217;t. The original reason for init() was that ancient versions of Java couldn&#8217;t dynamically invoke constructors with arguments, so there was no way to give the constructur a ServletConfig. That no longer applies, but servlet containers still will only call your no-arg constructor. So you won&#8217;t have access to a ServletConfig or ServletContext.</li>
	<li><b> How can a servlet refresh automatically if some new data has entered the database? </b> - You can use a client-side Refresh or Server Push.</li>

<li><b>Is is possible for an EJB client to marshal an object of class java.lang.Class to an EJB?</b> - Technically yes, spec. compliant NO! - The enterprise bean must not attempt to query a class to obtain information about the declared members that are not otherwise accessible to the enterprise bean because of the security rules of the Java language.</li>
	<li><b>Is it legal to have static initializer blocks in EJB?</b> - Although technically it is legal, static initializer blocks are used to execute some piece of code before executing any constructor or method while instantiating a class. Static initializer blocks are also typically used to initialize static fields - which may be illegal in EJB if they are read/write - In EJB this can be achieved by including the code in either the ejbCreate(), setSessionContext() or setEntityContext() methods.</li>
