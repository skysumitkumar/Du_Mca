A- ADO can access data from flat files as well as the databases,it is the encapsulation of DAO,RDO,OLE and hence called as OLE-DB technology.RDO follows a hierarchy model following its base objects rdoenvironment,rdoconnections,rdoresultset,rdoqueryobject which gives a way to manage multiple connections and multiple result set objects but is expensive to implement unwanted object persistence.
