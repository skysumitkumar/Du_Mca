					<description>Whoops, egg on my face. I had the nagging suspicion that I had not considered all when stating that objects are passed by reference. Though the details can be ignored by the programmer, they need to be stated for the sake of correctness.

Java is strictly pass by value. See http://javadude.com/articles/passbyvalue.htm for an explanation that is vastly superior to anything I can write!

cheers</description>

					<description>Answer 4: is bugus, as is the question. Any interviewer asking it should be kicked in the shin -&amp;#62; or politely asked why on earth anyone would want to use this information. Comment 12 goes a long way, but think of private member variables to figure this one out. Though the answer is technically correct, there is no reason to even need to use this fact IMHO.
Answer 35: when finalizing a member object, you are finalizing the *reference*, not the data contained in the member object. create a  and feel free to modify the contents... Primitive data types are, of course, a different matter.
Answer 36: abstract methods may also occur in interfaces
Answer 54: in other words, the return type is not part of the method signature
Answer 59: see answer 35. This is IMO based on the misconception that the java programming language can't use pointers. This is, ofcourse, complete nonsense. For example, all objects are passed by reference in java...

Use this information at your own risk. its only my opinion</description>

					<description>Answer 22: IMHO preemptive scheduling has something to do with the scheduler being able to suspend a running thread (i.e. preempt it), while time slicing relies on the threads to suspend themselves after having run through their slice of processor time. Time sliced schedulers have some obvious drawbacks, one of which most windows 3.x users might remember!

My thoughts on this matter might be incorrect. Use at your own discretion!</description>

					<description>Answer 8 incorrect, also collides with answer 11. See String.hashCode()
Answer 10 wrong IMO. Platform dependent.
Answer 22 default is often referred to as friendly (see Bruce Eckel)
Answer 26 maybe add sandbox info. Webstart makes the differentiation difficult
Answer 27 using multiple classloaders -&amp;#62; interesting for people using tomcat
Answer 31 not complete / question incorrect :)
Answer 32 I believe one can also write to a socket
Answer 33 limitations of unsigned applets in the sandbox

This addendum is not guaranteed to be correct and its only my opinion. The interviewer should have a clue about what he is asking, so I guess its ok to include technical information here</description>

					<description>Write out a function that prints out all the permutations of a string.
For example, abc would give you abc, acb, bac, bca, cab, cba

Another solution

#include 
#include 
#include 
#include 
using namespace std;

typedef set setchar;
char szPermutation[256];

void permutate(setchar charset, char* szPermute )
{
	if (!charset.size())
	{
		cout &amp;#62; strPermutation;
	cout </description>
