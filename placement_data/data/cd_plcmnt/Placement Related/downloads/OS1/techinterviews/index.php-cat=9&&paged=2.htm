			<ol>
<li><b>What is datagrid?</b> The DataGrid Web server control is a powerful tool for displaying information from a data source. It is easy to use; you can display editable data in a professional-looking grid by setting only a few properties. At the same time, the grid has a sophisticated object model that provides you with great flexibility in how you display the data.</p>
	<li><b>What&#8217;s the difference between the <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpref/html/frlrfSystemWebUIWebControlsDataGridClassTopic.asp  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpref/html/frlrfSystemWebUIWebControlsDataGridClassTopic.asp'" tppabs="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpref/html/frlrfSystemWebUIWebControlsDataGridClassTopic.asp">System.Web.UI.WebControls.DataGrid</a> and and <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpref/html/frlrfSystemWindowsFormsDataGridClassTopic.asp  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpref/html/frlrfSystemWindowsFormsDataGridClassTopic.asp'" tppabs="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpref/html/frlrfSystemWindowsFormsDataGridClassTopic.asp">System.Windows.Forms.DataGrid</a>?</b> The Web UI control does not inherently support master-detail data structures. As with other Web server controls, it does not support two-way data binding. If you want to update data, you must write code to do this yourself. You can only edit one row at a time. It does not inherently support sorting, although it raises events you can handle in order to sort the grid contents. You can bind the Web Forms DataGrid to any object that supports the IEnumerable interface. The Web Forms DataGrid control supports paging. It is easy to customize the appearance and layout of the Web Forms DataGrid control as compared to the Windows Forms one.  <a href="-p=102.htm#more-102" tppabs="http://www.techinterviews.com/?p=102#more-102">(more&#8230;)</a>

			<ol>
	<li><b>What&#8217;s the difference between code-based security and role-based security? Which one is better?</b> Code security is the approach of using permissions and permission sets for a given code to run. The admin, for example, can disable running executables off the Internet or restrict access to corporate database to only few applications. Role-based security most of the time involves the code running with the privileges of the current user. This way the code cannot supposedly do more harm than mess up a single user account. There&#8217;s no better, or 100% thumbs-up approach, depending on the nature of deployment, both code-based and role-based security could be implemented to an extent.

An assembly provides the common language runtime with the information it needs to be aware of type implementations. To the runtime, a type does not exist outside the context of an assembly.  <a href="-p=78.htm#more-78" tppabs="http://www.techinterviews.com/?p=78#more-78">(more&#8230;)</a>

			<ol>
	<li>What is .NET Framework?</li>
	<li>Is .NET a runtime service or a development platform? Answer It&#8217;s bothand actually a lot more. Microsoft .NET is a company-wide initiative. It includes a new way of delivering software and services to businesses and consumers. A part of Microsoft.NET is the .NET Frameworks. The frameworks is the first part of the MS.NET initiate to ship and it was given out to attendees at the PDC in July. The .NET frameworks consists of two parts: the .NET common language runtime and the .NET class library. These two components are packaged together into the .NET Frameworks SDK which will be available for free download from Microsoft&#8217;s MSDN web site later this month. In addition, the SDK also includes command-line compilers for C#, C++, JScript, and VB. You use these compilers to build applications and components. These components require the runtime to execute so this is a development platform. When Visual Studio.NET ships, it will include the .NET SDK and a GUI editor, wizards, tools, and a slew of other things. However, Visual Studio.NET is NOT required to build .NET applications.</li>

<li><b>What&#8217;s a Windows process? </b>It&#8217;s an application that&#8217;s running and had been allocated memory.</p>
	<li><b>What&#8217;s typical about a Windows process in regards to memory allocation?</b> Each process is allocated its own block of available RAM space, no process can access another process&#8217; code or data.

	<ol>
	<li><b><br />
I am constantly writing the drawing procedures with System.Drawing.Graphics, but having to use the try and dispose blocks is too time-consuming with Graphics objects. Can I automate this?</b> Yes, the code</p>
	<blockquote><pre>
System.Drawing.Graphics canvas = new System.Drawing.Graphics();
try
{
	//some code
}
finally
	canvas.Dispose();
</pre></blockquote>
	<p>is functionally equivalent to</p>
	<blockquote><pre>
using (System.Drawing.Graphics canvas = new System.Drawing.Graphics())
{
	//some code
}	//canvas.Dispose() gets called automatically
