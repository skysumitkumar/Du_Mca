		<p>What is the difference between QC and QA? </p>
	<p>Quality assurance is the process where the documents for the proudct to be tested is verified with actual requirements of the customers. It includes inspection, auditing , code review , meeting etc.</p>
	<p>Quality control is the process where the product is actually executed and the expected behaviour is veritied by comparing with the actual behaviour of the software under test. All the testing types like black box testing, white box testing comes under quality control.</p>
	<p>Quality assurance is done before quality control.

		<p>5. How much interaction with users should testers have, and why? </p>
	<p>Here we have to understand , who are the users ? Are they really end users or the customer who is gives the testing job.<br />
Example, If a bank is given testing job to a &#8220;testing only&#8221; company, then, for the company, bank is the users. But actually, the users are who uses the software/product/service of the bank.</p>
	<p>If we are communicating with end users, then we may need to understand the requirements fully and start testing and also should suggest how the changes in developing can affect the user ? It is  nothing but risk analysis.</p>
	<p>But is the user is the bank (in above example), then, some users expect daily testing status, daily progress report, test plan and test report along with other services for other user group (explained above).<br />
These are the deliverables the testing team should provide and the testing team should communicate with the bank not the end user directly. It is the bank&#8217;s job to understand and gather requirements from their end user (their customer)

		<p>Glass Box testing is also called as white box testing, This is a code based testing, testing the each and every paths and loops in every module, this is also called as structual testing, this testing is fully based on the coding.</p>
	<p>Black Box testing is called as Functionality testing, By this we can test the functionality of the applilcation, this testing will be conducted after the project is completed.

		<p>Q. What is quality assurance?<br />
A: Quality Assurance ensures all parties concerned with the project adhere to the process and procedures, standards and templates and test readiness reviews.<br />
Rob Davis&#8217; QA service depends on the customers and projects. A lot will depend on team leads or managers, feedback to developers and communications among customers, managers, developers&#8217; test engineers and testers.

		<p>I am an IT Recruitment Manager and often have to interview testers. I find a useful question is to ask the candidate to describe a specific project and the testing lifecycle they went through.  Did they write the master test plan?  What did it include? Did they write test plans?  What type of testing did they do?  What did they base their test scripts on?  How often did they receive a build to test?  How did they create the test data?</p>
	<p>I also ask them:</p>
	<p>Tell me about a time when you received a late build to test, but the deadline for testing didn&#8217;t change.  How did you meet the deadline?<br />
(I&#8217;m looking for a strategic approach, rather than just work harder/longer.  ie.  prioritising the test cases)</p>
	<p>Another good one is to ask:</p>
	<p>Tell me about a time when you received a build to test which differed to the original functional specifications.  How did you deal with this?  (hopefully this doesn&#8217;t happen too often, but I&#8217;m sure most testers have had to deal with this scenario.  I&#8217;m looking for a pragmatic approach.  Was the code just completely untestable, or were they able to create test scripts on the fly? If untestable, how did they communicate this back to the project manager?)</p>
	<p>Hope you find this useful.<br />
Cheers

		<p>I need you help to convince my management why SW needs more coverage than HW/FW<br />
I&#8217;m SWQA Manager for well know PC Peripheral as most of the management have been hardware oriented people I have hard time convince them Software QA testing need more coverage when there is a bug fix or maintance release compare to Firmware testing.<br />
There is only one QA Engineer will involve if there is new FW project, but if there new SW project I would need about 3 to 5 people and the test cycle will be longer than the FW qualification.<br />
Please help.</p>

	<p>Validation: The comparison between the actual characteristics of something (e.g. a product of a software project and the expected characteristics).Validation is checking that you have built the right system.</p>
