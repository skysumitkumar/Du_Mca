	<p>actor. Someone or something outside the system that interacts with the system.</p>
	<p>Add-ins command. A command on the Tools menu that allows you to add your own customized<br />
commands to any RequisitePro menu. These menu commands can be used to start external applications,<br />
such as e-mail or the Windows Notepad, directly from RequisitePro. In addition, you can configure a<br />
command to open an individual file with the application of your choice.<br />
administrators group. A group of users with full permissions to work in a project. These users can<br />
change a project’s structure, create and modify data, modify and delete projectwide views, and set and maintain security permissions. Users can be added and removed from the group, but the group cannot be deleted. Administrator group permissions cannot be modified.</p>
	<p>analyst. See system analyst.</p>
	<p>anchor. The first item you click when using multiple select actions to select a range of items. In<br />
RequisitePro, the term anchor is generally used to mean the first cell you click in a view. You use the anchor to select a range of cells. For example, if you click the cell in row 1, column 1 of a Traceability Matrix, that cell becomes the anchor. If you then Shift-click the cell in row 10, column 3 of the matrix, all of the cells in rows 1 through 10 and columns 1 through 3 are selected. To reset the anchor, click anywhere outside the range. The cell you click is the new anchor. You can also use an anchor to select a range of items in documents and in certain dialog boxes that support multiple select actions. See multiple select actions.</p>
	<p>archiving. The process of duplicating the database, documents, and all related files in a project for the purpose of restoring them at a later time.</p>
	<p>attribute. Descriptive information that provides important details about a requirement or discussion. See also requirement attribute.<br />
attribute label. The name of the requirement attribute, such as risk, priority, or author. Also referred to<br />
as requirement attribute label.</p>
	<p>Attribute Matrix. A spreadsheet-like table view that displays requirements in rows and the attributes<br />
that describe them in columns. You can add or change values in the attribute fields. Also referred to as<br />
requirement Attribute Matrix.</p>
	<p>attribute type. A set of descriptive and operational information associated with a requirement attribute<br />
when the attribute is created. Attribute values can be list-type or entry-type. For list-type attributes, you<br />
select a textual attribute value from a list box. For entry-type attributes, you type in a value, such as a<br />
number, text string, date, or time. Also referred to as requirement attribute type.<br />
attribute value. Information assigned to a requirement attribute. Attribute values can be text or<br />
numbers. For example, the attribute priority can be assigned the values Low, Medium, and High. Also<br />
referred to as requirement attribute value.<br />
author. The user responsible for creating or modifying a document or requirement.<br />
author (version information). The user responsible for the changes associated with a given revision.</p>
	<p>B<br />
baseline. A reviewed and approved release of artifacts that constitutes an agreed basis for further<br />
evolution or development and that can be changed only through a formal procedure, such as change<br />
management and configuration control. See also Unified Change Management.<br />
bookmark. A marker inserted at a specific point in a document to which the user may return for later<br />
reference. In Microsoft Word, a bookmark is a location or selection of text named for reference purposes.</p>
	<p>Bookmarks are implemented in RequisitePro documents to designate requirement text. Bookmarks are<br />
designated by square brackets, as in the following: [example].</p>
	<p>C<br />
change description (version information). Textual information that specifies the justification or<br />
reasoning behind the changes associated with a given revision of a project, document, or requirement.<br />
See also version information.</p>
	<p>change-managed relationship. A connection between two requirements that implies dependency or<br />
another type of relationship. RequisitePro tracks two types of change-managed relationships: hierarchical<br />
relationships and traceability relationships. Changes to either of the requirements can cause a “suspect”<br />
condition in the relationship. See also suspect relationship state.<br />
child requirement. A requirement that participates in a hierarchical relationship with a parent<br />
requirement. A child can have only one parent requirement. See also parent requirement, hierarchical<br />
requirement.<br />
circular traceability relationship. A relationship between a requirement and itself, or an indirect<br />
relationship that leads back to a previously traced-from node. Traceability relationships cannot have<br />
circular references. RequisitePro checks for circular references each time you establish a traceability<br />
relationship. RequisitePro also checks for circularity when you create an external relationship. The<br />
circular check references only internal requirements and first-level external requirements.<br />
ClearCase. See Rational ClearCase.<br />
ClearQuest. See Rational ClearQuest.<br />
collapse indicator. See expand/collapse indicator.<br />
cross-project traceability. A RequisitePro feature that allows you to establish traceability relationships<br />
between requirements that reside in different projects. See also external traceability.<br />
CSV file. A comma-separated value text file, commonly used to exchange files between database<br />
systems that use different formats. Sometimes called comma-delimited files, CSV files can be imported into<br />
RequisitePro.<br />
D<br />
deleted users group. A security group of users who have been removed from other groups, have no<br />
permissions, and cannot log on to RequisitePro. This group is maintained by the project administrator<br />
for project history.<br />
dialog box. An interactive window displayed on the screen that solicits a response from the user.<br />
290 Glossary<br />
dialog box shortcut. See keyboard shortcuts.<br />
directory. A catalog for file names and other directories. A directory is an organization of files (or<br />
folders) grouped for the user’s convenience. The topmost directory is called the root directory. The<br />
directories within a directory are called subdirectories.<br />
discussions. A RequisitePro feature that lets you address comments, issues, and questions to a group of<br />
discussion participants. Discussions can be associated with one or more specific requirements or refer to<br />
the project in general.<br />
discussion item. A discussion item is either the initial discussion topic or a response. A response can be<br />
either to the initial discussion text or to another response.<br />
document. Any Microsoft Word document. It may be part of the RequisitePro project or outside the<br />
project, and it may or may not contain requirements. See also requirements document.<br />
document outline. A reference document or template used to create new documents in RequisitePro. An<br />
outline can include formats, page layout information, fonts, and Word styles. It is useful for maintaining<br />
consistency across documents of the same type. Document outline information is stored in a .def file. It<br />
includes the full name of the template, a description of the outline, and the associated Word template&#8217;s<br />
DOS filename (.dot). See also document type.<br />
document properties. Specific items of information about a document. Documents have attributes<br />
associated with them such as author, date and time of last revision, and file name.<br />
document type. Defines descriptive and operational information associated with a requirements<br />
document. The document type serves as a template for each requirements document you create of that<br />
type. The document type defines the document’s file extension, such as .prd; all documents of the same<br />
document type share the same file extension. The document type identifies a default requirement type;<br />
each new requirement you create in the document is based on the default requirement type unless you<br />
indicate otherwise. The document type also identifies a document template, which controls the<br />
document page layout, default text, paragraph styles, and other structure.<br />
document version. A revision of a document, identified in the document properties revision history. A<br />
new version is created when a document is changed and saved. See revision.<br />
E<br />
enhancement request. A type of stakeholder request that specifies a new feature or functionality of the<br />
system. Certain Rational RequisitePro requirement types have attributes that associate the requirement<br />
with specific records in Rational ClearQuest. By default, if you are using a project based on the Use-Case<br />
Project template, the feature (FEAT) requirement type includes EnhancementRequest and Defect<br />
attributes that can associate the feature requirement with enhancement request and defect records in<br />
ClearQuest.<br />
enterprise database. A database that is designed to support a large, networked organization. An<br />
enterprise database offers scalability, security, and administrative features for large, complex projects.<br />
RequisitePro supports the use of the enterprise databases Oracle and SQL Server.<br />
entry-type attributes. Entry-type attributes are numeric, text, time, or date values that are typed in by<br />
project users. An entry-type attribute can be configured with a default value, which users can accept or<br />
replace as they create or modify requirements. For example, if you want to set a default cost of $20,<br />
format the entry-type attribute “Cost” to accept integer values and have a default value of 20. You define<br />
Glossary 291<br />
attributes in the Attributes tab of the Project Properties dialog box. Requirement attributes can be entry<br />
type or list type. If you have configured an integration with Rational ClearQuest, you have two<br />
additional default requirement types, EnhancementRequest and Defect. See also attribute type, attribute<br />
value. Compare list-type attributes.<br />
exclusive access. A condition by which access to a RequisitePro project and its documents is available<br />
only to the user who opens the project. Exclusive access is required to change a variety of project<br />
characteristics. You set access when you open a project. You can open a project and its documents in<br />
exclusive mode only if the project and documents are not already open by another user.<br />
expand/collapse indicator. A small box displayed next to a requirement in a view, indicating that the<br />
requirement has one or more child requirements, or next to a discussion item in the Discussions dialog<br />
box, indicating that the discussion item has responses. The box contains a + or a -, indicating whether or<br />
not the requirement or discussion is displayed in an expanded or collapsed state. An item that can be<br />
expanded (that is, preceded by a +) contains hidden subitems that can be displayed. An item that can be<br />
collapsed (that is, preceded by a -) does not have hidden subitems.<br />
Explorer. RequisitePro’s primary navigation window. In this window, project artifacts (documents,<br />
requirements, and views) are displayed in packages in a tree browser.<br />
export. To move information from one system or program to another. You can export requirements from<br />
a RequisitePro view to Microsoft Word documents and to CSV files.<br />
extension. See file name extension.<br />
external project. A project containing requirements used to establish traceability relationships with<br />
requirements in a currently open project. See cross-project traceability.<br />
external requirement. A requirement residing in an external project. You can create traceability<br />
relationships between requirements in different projects.<br />
external traceability. Traceability relationships between requirements in two RequisitePro projects. See<br />
also traceability.<br />
F<br />
file name extension. A DOS file name extension (for example, .prd). File name extensions are used in<br />
RequisitePro to indicate document type and can contain a maximum of 20 characters.<br />
filtering. A process by which you can change the amount of information displayed in a view. You specify<br />
certain criteria on which to filter information. You can filter requirements by specifying certain distinct<br />
criteria for any or all of their attributes. For example, instead of displaying all requirements, you might<br />
apply a filter to display only requirements having a high priority. See also sorting and query.<br />
H<br />
hidden text. A Microsoft Word feature used to hide text within a document. Hidden text is delineated<br />
with a dotted underline. A requirement within a Word document begins with a requirement tag<br />
formatted in hidden text style. You can hide the tags for improved readability. Click Tools &gt; Options,<br />
and then click the View tab. Clear the Hidden text check box and click OK.<br />
292 Glossary<br />
hierarchical requirement. A requirement that is included within an ordered relationship with other<br />
requirements of the same type. Use hierarchical relationships to subdivide a general requirement into<br />
more explicit requirements. Child requirements provide additional detail for their parent requirement.<br />
For example:<br />
Parent requirement: The system shall display customer information.<br />
Child requirements provided for detail: Name, Address, Date of Birth.<br />
Each child requirement can have only one parent, but a requirement can be both a parent and a child. If a<br />
parent requirement is changed, the relationships with its children become suspect.<br />
I<br />
import. To bring information from one system or program into another. In RequisitePro, you can import<br />
documents and requirements from Microsoft Word and CSV files.<br />
Integrated Use Case Management. An integration between Rational RequisitePro and Rational Rose<br />
that allows you to associate use cases in Rose with RequisitePro documents and requirements. You can<br />
easily navigate between Rose use-case models and RequisitePro use-case documents and requirements.<br />
internationalization. The process of developing a program core whose feature and code designs do not<br />
make assumptions on the basis of a single language or locale and whose source code base simplifies the<br />
creation of different language editions of a program.<br />
K<br />
keyboard shortcuts. A dialog box shortcut is a keyboard combination you can use to move to tabs, fields,<br />
and buttons in a RequisitePro dialog box. To use a dialog box shortcut, press the Alt key while<br />
simultaneously pressing the underlined letter in a dialog tab, field, or button. For example, in the Project<br />
Properties, Document Properties, or Requirement Properties dialog boxes, press Alt-G to open the<br />
General tab.<br />
A menu shortcut is a keyboard combination you can use to open a menu. To use a menu shortcut, press<br />
the Alt key while simultaneously pressing the underlined letter in the menu. For example, to open the<br />
Requirement menu, press Alt-R. When a menu is displayed, you can select a command by pressing the<br />
key for the underlined letter in the command.<br />
keyword. Words that are used to help specify and define requirements. Many organizations use words<br />
such as shall, must, or will in their requirements, making it easier to separate a requirement from<br />
surrounding text in the document. Keywords are a part of the definition of a requirement type. You enter<br />
keywords in the Requirement Must Contain box in the Requirement Type dialog box.<br />
L<br />
label (version information). A string (no more than 20 characters long) that contains user-defined<br />
revision information. You can use a revision label for noting requirement, document, or project/archive<br />
version information.<br />
licensed user. A RequisitePro user. Each user who is associated with a license of RequisitePro is a<br />
licensed RequisitePro user. Also referred to as user.<br />
Glossary 293<br />
list-type attributes. Requirement attributes are either list-type or entry-type. List-type attributes are sets<br />
of descriptive values (for example, Status, which may contain the list values Proposed, Approved, In<br />
progress, and Complete). You can assign single values or multiple values for list-type attributes. You<br />
define attribute values in the Attributes tab in the Project Properties dialog box. See also attribute type,<br />
attribute value. Compare entry-type attributes.<br />
M<br />
matrix. An arrangement of rows and columns used for organizing related items in a view. See Attribute<br />
Matrix, Traceability Matrix.<br />
menu file. A text file with specific syntax that is used to add menu commands to any RequisitePro<br />
menu. Menu files typically have an MNU or TXT file extension. Menu files are referenced using the<br />
Add-ins command on the Tools menu. The commands appear on the RequisitePro menus in the order in<br />
which they are specified in the menu file.<br />
menu shortcuts. See keyboard shortcuts.<br />
Metrics. See Requirement Metrics.<br />
multiple select actions. Mouse actions and combination keyboard/mouse actions that you use to select<br />
multiple items in RequisitePro. Use Ctrl-Click to select multiple items that are not adjacent to each other.<br />
Hold down the Ctrl key and click the mouse. (You can also use Ctrl-click to clear a selected item.) Use<br />
Shift-click to select a range of items. Hold down the Shift key and click the mouse. Use Drag to select a<br />
range of items. With one item selected, drag the mouse. Release the mouse when the range is selected.<br />
multiple value list. An attribute type that supports one-to-many associations. You can use a multiple<br />
value list when you want to assign a requirement more than one value for a specific attribute.<br />
For example, you might create an attribute type called Owner, with multiple values Bob, John, and Sue,<br />
representing different users working on the same project. For this attribute, you might then assign only<br />
the values Bob and Sue to a particular requirement, indicating that Bob and Sue are responsible for this<br />
particular requirement, but John is not.<br />
N<br />
name. See requirement name.<br />
O<br />
offline author. A user who takes a RequisitePro document offline.<br />
offline authoring. A RequisitePro feature that lets users read and modify a document in Microsoft Word<br />
outside of RequisitePro (i.e., offline). When you take a document offline, RequisitePro creates a copy of<br />
the document in the directory you specify. The original is still stored in RequisitePro, but it is changed to<br />
a read-only document. Other users can view the document in RequisitePro, but they cannot edit it until<br />
you bring it back online.<br />
OLE. Object linking and embedding. You can create an OLE object in one application (original<br />
application) and insert it into files in other (source) applications. If you modify the OLE object in its<br />
original application, the changes are automatically reflected in any files containing the OLE object in a<br />
source application. You can use OLE objects in RequisitePro requirements documents.<br />
outline. See document outline.<br />
P<br />
package. A container, represented in the Explorer as a folder, that can contain requirements, documents,<br />
views, and other packages. You can place related artifacts in a single package for organizing your project.<br />
All project packages are shared by all project users.<br />
parent requirement. A requirement that participates in a hierarchical relationship with one or more<br />
child requirements. A parent can reside at the root level, or it can be nested in the hierarchy with a parent<br />
of its own. In either case, parents reside above their children in the hierarchy. See also child requirement,<br />
hierarchical requirement.<br />
parse. To break information into component parts so that a program can act upon it. The Import Wizard<br />
parses text to separate requirements in a document.<br />
peer requirement. A requirement that is at the same hierarchical level as another requirement. Two<br />
requirements are peer requirements when they are children of the same parent. All requirements at the<br />
root level are peer requirements of one another. See also parent requirement, child requirement, hierarchical<br />
requirement.<br />
pending requirement. A newly created requirement in a document or a view that has not yet been saved<br />
in the database.<br />
pending tag number. A tag number for a newly created requirement in a RequisitePro document. The<br />
requirement maintains the pending tag number until the document is saved. See also requirement tag.<br />
permissions. The RequisitePro privileges granted to a group of RequisitePro users. RequisitePro<br />
administrators or members of a group with project security permissions can assign permissions to<br />
groups. Also referred to as privileges or rights. See also security.<br />
project. A RequisitePro project. A project includes a database, documents, document types,<br />
requirements and their attributes, requirement types, requirement traceability, discussions, and user and<br />
group security. Within RequisitePro, you create a project first. You then create requirement documents<br />
and requirements in each document.<br />
project database. The requirements database managed by RequisitePro. The project database stores all<br />
requirements in the project, including those created in requirement documents. Changes you make to<br />
requirements in the documents are reflected in the project database. You can create requirements directly<br />
in the project database rather than in a requirement document using an Attribute Matrix view. These<br />
requirements can be modified or deleted in a view. Microsoft Access, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server<br />
databases can be used with RequisitePro projects. See also project database.<br />
project directory. A directory that contains information for a single RequisitePro project. You define the<br />
project directory when you create a new project. (By default, RequisitePro creates a directory name that<br />
matches what is typed in the Name box in the RequisitePro Project Properties dialog box.) For projects<br />
that use the Microsoft Access database, the database is stored in the project directory. The project<br />
directory does not store the database for projects that use an enterprise database (i.e., Oracle and SQL<br />
Server databases). Requirements documents for the project may be stored in another directory. The<br />
project directory path can contain up to 256 characters. See also project directory.<br />
Glossary 295<br />
project prefix. An identifier used for requirements in cross-project traceability. In an external project, the<br />
prefix is displayed before the tag requirement, separated from the tag by a period. For example, if a<br />
requirement’s tag is PR234 and the project’s prefix is GLOBAL, then the external requirement is<br />
displayed as GLOBAL.PR234. The prefix can be up to 8 characters and must be uppercase letters. You<br />
can change the prefix at any time in the Project Properties dialog box, General tab.<br />
project summary report. A report that displays the project’s entire structure in report form. The<br />
requirement types (and their attributes, including multiple value lists), document types, and document<br />
details are included in the printout.<br />
project template. A RequisitePro template that contains project structure including document types,<br />
requirement types, requirement attributes, packages, users, groups, and security.<br />
Q<br />
query. A method for filtering and sorting requirements in views by limiting the values of one or more<br />
attributes or by limiting traceability, and specifying the order in which the filtered requirements are<br />
displayed. For example, you might create a query to display only requirements having a high or medium<br />
priority. Within that filter, you might sort requirements first by priority, and then by cost.<br />
R<br />
Rational Administrator. A Rational tool that enables integrations between Rational products. Use<br />
Rational Administrator to configure Rational projects, which store software testing and development<br />
information.<br />
Rational ClearCase. Rational&#8217;s configuration management tool, which can be used to store copies of<br />
RequisitePro projects. If you are implementing a Unified Change Management model, you can use<br />
ClearCase to create baselines of RequisitePro projects.<br />
Rational ClearQuest. Rational’s defect and change tracking system. ClearQuest offers a flexible<br />
approach to track and manage all the change activities that are associated with an organization, such as<br />
defects and enhancement requests.<br />
Rational Rose. Rational’s visual modeling tool for designing and visualizing object-oriented and<br />
component-based applications. RequisitePro is integrated with Rose through Integrated Use Case<br />
Management.<br />
Rational TestManager. A Rational tool designed to help software development and testing professionals<br />
track software testing information through all phases of the software development, test, and revision<br />
cycles. RequisitePro requirements can be referenced from TestManager to ensure complete test coverage<br />
for all requirements. If a requirement changes, TestManager marks the associated test cases and test<br />
input as suspect. Using TestManager, you can create reports that show all suspect test cases and test<br />
input development coverage reports that show the percentage of requirements that have implemented<br />
test cases. If you have installed TestManager, we recommend that you develop all test artifacts in that<br />
tool.<br />
Rational Unified Process (RUP). Rational’s online knowledge base of proven software-development<br />
principles. The RUP captures many of the best practices in modern software development in a form that<br />
can be tailored to a wide range of projects and organizations. The RUP includes Tool Mentors, which<br />
296 Glossary<br />
provide descriptions on how Rational Software tools can be used to support particular steps and<br />
activities.<br />
Rational XDE. Rational XDE Professional, an eXtended Development Environment that has been<br />
designed for developers and is fully integrated into the IBM WebSphere Workbench, IBM WebSphere<br />
Studio Application Developer, and Microsoft Visual Studio .NET. Its capabilities include pattern engine<br />
support, Unified Modeling Language (UML) visualization and documentation support, code templates,<br />
and automatic or on-demand synchronization of code and models. XDE Professional includes Rational<br />
XDE Modeler, which allows users to communicate designs and patterns in UML. Using XDE Modeler,<br />
team members can create semantically rich models for architecture, business needs, design, reusable<br />
assets, and management-level communication, which can then be used to generate working code.<br />
Developers can round-trip engineer changes, and architects can see whether architectural changes are<br />
required. Rational RequisitePro is integrated with XDE through Integrated Use Case Management.<br />
read-only access. An option by which a RequisitePro project or document is restricted to viewing.<br />
renumbering. The process of assigning new numbers to requirements. The renumber feature is useful<br />
for eliminating “holes” in a numbering scheme, which can result when you delete requirements. To<br />
renumber requirements, you must open the project in exclusive mode. In addition, if security is enabled,<br />
you must have project structure permission to renumber requirements. To renumber requirements in<br />
documents, all documents that contain requirements of that type must be open.<br />
requirement. Describes a condition or capability that a system must provide; it is either derived directly<br />
from user needs, or stated in a contract, standard, specification, or other formally imposed document.<br />
requirement attribute. A descriptive field of information associated with a requirement. RequisitePro<br />
requirement attributes are either system attributes (defined by RequisitePro) or user-defined (defined by<br />
the project owner). See attribute.<br />
requirement attribute label. The name of the requirement attribute, such as risk, priority, or author. See<br />
attribute label.<br />
requirement Attribute Matrix. See Attribute Matrix.<br />
requirement attribute type. See attribute type.<br />
requirement attribute value. See attribute value.<br />
requirement location. The location where a requirement was created or the location to which it was last<br />
moved. The location can be either a specific requirements document or the project database.<br />
Requirement Metrics. A Rational RequisitePro feature for compiling statistics on requirement name,<br />
text, attributes, relationships, and revisions. These report results are displayed in Microsoft Excel and can<br />
be manipulated using Excel’s charting capabilities. Two types of reports are available: static reports<br />
(which show results about the project at the present time) and trend analysis reports (which use<br />
time-sensitive filters that analyze changes in requirement text, attributes, traceability, and hierarchical<br />
relationships).<br />
requirement name. A user-defined title for a requirement. Like tag and text attributes, the name can be<br />
used to reference requirements. The name is displayed by default in all Rational RequisitePro views. All<br />
requirements must have either a name, text, or both, but requirements located in documents must have<br />
text. A name does not need to be unique and can be changed at any time if you created the requirement<br />
or belong to a group that has update permissions.<br />
requirement tag. The unique identifier of each requirement in a project. A requirement tag is composed<br />
of a tag prefix and a unique numerical value, such as “PR100.1.2.” The tag prefix is always the<br />
Glossary 297<br />
requirement type, as defined in the Project Properties dialog box. The numerical value is generated by<br />
RequisitePro. The tag prefix can contain a maximum of 20 characters. Each requirement type in your<br />
project has a different tag prefix (for example, FEAT, SR, UCS) that you determine when you create a new<br />
project or add a new requirement type. When you add a requirement to a requirements document or<br />
database, RequisitePro assigns the requirement the appropriate tag prefix, dependent on its requirement<br />
type, and an incremental numerical value. See also pending tag number.<br />
requirement text. The full textual content of a requirement. In a document, it may include embedded<br />
and linked objects, such as graphics, tables, and Microsoft Word files.<br />
requirement type. A set of descriptive and operational information associated with a requirement when<br />
the requirement is created. A requirement type serves as an outline for all requirements of the same type<br />
and is useful for classifying and grouping similar requirements in a project. Each requirement type has<br />
its own set of user-defined attributes. See also requirement attribute.<br />
requirement version. A requirement attribute that shows the version of the requirement. As a<br />
requirement evolves, it is helpful to identify the version numbers (and history) of requirements changes.<br />
requirements document. A document created in Microsoft Word or RequisitePro that captures<br />
requirements and is used to communicate product development efforts. Each requirements document<br />
addresses a particular requirement type, such as product features, use cases, and supplementary<br />
specifications. A RequisitePro requirements document differs from a Word document in that you can<br />
access requirement attributes and other information directly from within the requirements document.<br />
Also referred to as document or RequisitePro document.<br />
requirements management. A systematic approach to eliciting, organizing, documenting, and<br />
managing the changing requirements of a software application.<br />
requirements text. The full textutal content of a requirement. In a document, it may include embedded<br />
and linked objects, such as graphics, tables, and Microsoft Word files.<br />
RequisitePro document. A Microsoft Word document that is part of a RequisitePro project. Most Word<br />
functionality is available within RequisitePro documents.<br />
RequisiteWeb. Rational’s Web interface that allows clients to access RequisitePro requirements<br />
information across an intranet. By using browsers &#8212; Netscape Navigator or Microsoft Internet Explorer &#8211;<br />
RequisiteWeb provides a thin client solution to access project documents and data. No Requisite<br />
application-specific files need to be installed on individual machines.<br />
revision. A distinct version of a project, document, or requirement. A revision is identified by a unique<br />
internal revision number, generated by RequisitePro.<br />
revision number. The number identifying a revision. Revision numbers are automatically incremented<br />
each time you or another user changes and saves a project, document, or requirement. Revision numbers<br />
take the form M.n, where M is generally 1 and n is a 4-digit number that is incremented each time<br />
changes are saved.<br />
root requirement. A requirement at the uppermost level of the requirements hierarchy. A root<br />
requirement does not have a parent requirement. See also parent requirement, child requirement, hierarchical<br />
requirement.<br />
Rose. See Rational Rose.<br />
RUP. See Rational Unified Process.<br />
S<br />
security. Prevention of system use, potential harm, or data loss by unauthorized individuals. In<br />
RequisitePro, users are given specific permissions that determine the level of access they have to projects.<br />
If you are a RequisitePro administrator or a member of a group with project security permissions, you<br />
can assign permissions. See also permissions.<br />
Select. See multiple select actions.<br />
SHIFT-click. See multiple select actions.<br />
SoDA. Rational’s Software Documentation Automation tool.<br />
sorting. The process of establishing a specific order for the information in a RequisitePro view. You can<br />
sort requirements using one or many requirement attributes. For example, you might sort requirements<br />
first by priority (high, medium, or low). Then, within priority, you might sort again by unique ID<br />
number. See also filtering, query.<br />
suspect relationship state. A state applied to a traceability or hierarchical relationship when a change<br />
occurs to one or both of the requirements in the relationship. A suspect relationship state indicates that,<br />
because of the modification to one or both requirements, the relationship may require modification as<br />
well. When suspect relationships are displayed in an Attribute Matrix, an (s) appears after the<br />
requirement tag in the Traced-to or Traced-from column. See also change-managed relationship, Traceability<br />
Matrix.<br />
system analyst. An individual who leads and coordinates requirements elicitation and use-case<br />
modeling by outlining the system’s functionality and delimiting the system.<br />
T<br />
tag. See requirement tag.<br />
tag prefix. The prefix for a requirement type. A tag is a unique identifier assigned to each requirement<br />
you create. The tag prefix can be up to 20 characters long, and it is defined as a part of the requirement<br />
type.<br />
template. See .dot file (Word template) or project template.<br />
TestManager. See Rational TestManager.<br />
text. See requirement text.<br />
trace to/trace from relationship. A relationship between two requirements that implies the source,<br />
derivation, or dependencies between the requirements. The trace to/trace from state appears in a<br />
Traceability Matrix or Traceability Tree when you create a relationship between two requirements.<br />
For example, you might create a feature requirement (Requirement A) that calls for a new command to<br />
be added to a particular menu in your application. Creating this requirement might cause you to create a<br />
software requirement (Requirement B) associated with that menu item. You would thus create a<br />
traceability relationship in which the software requirement (B) is traced from the feature requirement<br />
(A). There can be only one traceability relationship between any two requirements. The difference<br />
between calling it a “trace to” or “trace from” relationship is one of perspective. For the example above,<br />
both of the following statements are true: A is traced to B, and B is traced from A. In RequisitePro, the<br />
terms trace to/trace from relationship and traceability relationship are used interchangeably.<br />
Glossary 299<br />
traceability. A relationship between two requirements that implies the source, derivation, or<br />
dependencies between the requirements using the “trace to” and “trace from” features.<br />
Traceability Matrix. A view that illustrates the relationships between requirements of the same or<br />
different types. You use this matrix to create, modify, and delete traceability relationships and view<br />
indirect relationships and traceability relationships with a suspect state. You can also use the Traceability<br />
Matrix to filter and sort the row requirements and column requirements separately. See also view.<br />
traceability relationship. See trace to/trace from relationship.<br />
Traceability Tree. A view that displays all internal and external requirements traced to or from a<br />
requirement (depending on the direction of the tree). The Traceability Tree displays only the first level<br />
cross-project traceability. For example, if an internal requirement is traced to an external requirement, the<br />
external requirement is displayed in the Traceability Tree, but other requirements that the external<br />
requirement is traced to are not displayed in the tree. Also referred to as a tree view. See also view.<br />
tree view. See Traceability Tree.<br />
type. See requirement type.<br />
U<br />
Unified Change Management (UCM). Rational&#8217;s out-of-the-box usage model for managing change in<br />
software system development, from requirements to release. UCM is a unified approach to configuration<br />
management and change request management, automated in Rational ClearCase and Rational<br />
ClearQuest. ClearCase can be set up to implement the UCM model for basic activity-based configuration<br />
management or in conjunction with ClearQuest to provide full change-request management. To<br />
implement the UCM model when creating a baseline of a Rational RequisitePro project, the project must<br />
be associated with a UCM-enabled Rational project in the Rational Administrator.<br />
Universal Naming Convention (UNC). The system of naming files among computers on a network so<br />
that a file on a given computer will have the same path when accessed from any of the other computers<br />
on the network. For example, if the directory c:\path1\path2\&#8230;pathn on computer servern is shared<br />
under the name pathdirs, a user on another computer would open \servern\pathdirs\filename.ext to<br />
access the file c:\path1\path2\&#8230;pathn\filename.ext on servern. Also called Uniform Naming Convention.<br />
use case. A sequence of actions that a system performs, yielding an observable result of value (a work<br />
output) to a particular actor (someone or something outside the system that interacts with the system).<br />
user information. A RequisitePro user’s user name, password, and e-mail address. If you are a member<br />
of a group with project security permissions, you can edit another user’s information. In addition, a user<br />
can edit his or her own user information.<br />
users group. A security group that can, by default, read documents and requirements, create views, and<br />
participate in discussions. Administrators can modify Users group permissions.<br />
V<br />
version information. Unique, identifying information associated with a project, document, or<br />
requirement each time it is modified. The internally generated revision number, combined with<br />
information about the author, date, time, and reason for modification, constitute version information. See<br />
also revision.<br />
300 Glossary<br />
view. A window that displays requirements, the attributes assigned to requirements, and the<br />
relationships between requirements. A view displays information in spreadsheet-like tables or in outline<br />
trees. In RequisitePro, the terms view and view window are used interchangeably. See also Attribute Matrix,<br />
Traceability Matrix, Traceability Tree.<br />
W<br />
wildcard character. A keyboard character that can be used to represent one or many characters.<br />
Typically the asterisk (*) represents one or more characters, and the underscore (_) represents a single<br />
character. For example, the file specification *.* (pronounced “star-dot-star”) uses the asterisk wildcard to<br />
mean “any combination of file name and extension.” When filtering the subject of discussions, the<br />
percent symbol (%) is the wildcard character used to represent one or more characters.<br />
Word document. A document created in Microsoft Word or RequisitePro that is saved in Word format.<br />
See also RequisitePro document.<br />
Word Template. See .dot file.</p>
