		<h3><a href="-p=85.htm" tppabs="http://www.techinterviews.com/?p=85" rel="bookmark" title="Interview questions: C++ gamedev interview questions">C++ gamedev interview questions</a></h3>
			<p>This set of questions came from a prominent gaming company. As you can see, the answers are not given (the interviews are typically conducted by senior developers), but there&#8217;s a set of notes with common mistakes to avoid.
<ol>
	<li><b>Explain which of the following declarations will compile and what will be constant - a pointer or the value pointed at:</b>
	<ul>
	<li>const char *
	<li>char const *
	<li>char * const
	</ul>
	<p><i>Note:</i> Ask the candidate whether the first declaration is pointing to a string or a single character. Both explanations are correct, but if he says that it&#8217;s a single character pointer, ask why a whole string is initialized as char* in C++. If he says this is a string declaration, ask him to declare a pointer to a single character. Competent candidates should not have problems pointing out why const char* can be both a character and a string declaration, incompetent ones will come up with invalid reasons.<br />
	<a id="more-85"></a></p>
	<li><b>You&#8217;re given a simple code for the class BankCustomer. Write the following functions:</b>
	<ul>
	<li>Copy constructor
	<li>= operator overload
	<li>== operator overload
	<li>+ operator overload (customers&#8217; balances should be added up, as an example of joint account between husband and wife)
	</ul>
	<p><i>Note:</i>Anyone confusing assignment and equality operators should be dismissed from the interview. The applicant might make a mistake of passing by value, not by reference. The candidate might also want to return a pointer, not a new object, from the addition operator. Slightly hint that you&#8217;d like the value to be changed outside the function, too, in the first case. Ask him whether the statement customer3 = customer1 + customer2 would work in the second case.</p>
	<li><b>What problems might the following macro bring to the application?</b><br />
	<blockquote><p>#define sq(x) x*x</p></blockquote>
	<li><b>Consider the following struct declarations:</b><br />
	<blockquote><pre>
struct A { A(){ cout << \"A\"; } };
struct B { B(){ cout << \"B\"; } };
struct C { C(){ cout << \"C\"; } };
struct D { D(){ cout << \"D\"; } };
struct E : D { E(){ cout << \"E\"; } };
struct F : A, B
{
	C c;
	D d;
	E e;
	F() : B(), A(),d(),c(),e() { cout << \"F\"; }
};</pre></blockquote>
	<p>What constructors will be called when an instance of F is initialized? Produce the program output when this happens.</p>
	<li><b>Anything wrong with this code?</b><br />
	<blockquote><pre>
T *p = new T[10];
delete p;
	</pre></blockquote>
	<p><i>Note</i>: Incorrect replies: &#8220;No, everything is correct&#8221;, &#8220;Only the first element of the array will be deleted&#8221;, &#8220;The entire array will be deleted, but only the first element destructor will be called&#8221;.</p>
	<li><b>Anything wrong with this code?</b><br />
	<blockquote><pre>
T *p = 0;
delete p;
</pre></blockquote>
	<p><i>Note:</i> Typical wrong answer: Yes, the program will crash in an attempt to delete a null pointer.

		<p>rachna:</p>
	<p>The issue with #5 is that you *must* always call array delete when deleting an array (in this case, an array to T&#8217;s. The proper code looks like this:</p>
	<p>class T {int i;};<br />
main()<br />
{<br />
T *p = new T[10];<br />
delete <b>[]</b> p;<br />
}</p>
	<p>BTW, my best advice for C++ interviews is to read Scott Meyers&#8217; books.

		<p>Shafi, that is not correct. &#8220;const char * p&#8221; == &#8220;char const * p&#8221; (i.e., the &#8220;char&#8221; is const&#8221;). Try it. The correct &#8220;easy way to remember&#8221; is that const makes the type immediately following on the LEFT constant.

	<li id="comment-6264">
		<p>Another way to remember is to recall that we are declaring a pointer and that a * will be used later to dereference (access) the variable:</p>
	<p>Therefore, if the const is on the left of the *, the const acts (through the *) on the dereferenced variable (i.e. the variable itself is constant), otherwise if the const is on the right of the * the const acts on the pointer itself (the pointer is constant).</p>
	<p>In other words the const is acting in the same way that we would try to use the pointer/variable.</p>

	<p>NOT really. The result depends on the compiler (I did not check what the standard says, I’ll do).<br />
On Solaris, AIX, GCC, aCC (HP-UX) the result is 30 (sorry I made a typo in my previous remark)
