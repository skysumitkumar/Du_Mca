<li>The top management was feeling that when there are any changes in the technology being used, development schedules etc, it was a waste of time to update the Test Plan. Instead, they were emphasizing that you should put your time into testing than working on the test plan.  Your Project Manager asked for your opinion. You have argued that Test Plan is very important and you need to update your test plan from time to time. It&#8217;s not a waste of time and testing activities would be more effective when you have your plan clear. Use some metrics. How you would support your argument to have the test plan consistently updated all the time.</p>
	<li>The QAI is starting a project to put the CSTE certification online. They will use an automated process for recording candidate information, scheduling candidates for exams, keeping track of results and sending out certificates. Write a brief test plan for this new project.<a id="more-106"></a>

	<li>What are the disadvantages of overtesting?
	<li>What happens to the test plan if the application has a functionality not mentioned in the requirements?
	<li>You are given two scenarios to test.  Scenario 1 has only one terminal for entry and processing whereas scenario 2 has several terminals where the data input can be made.  Assuming that the processing work is the same, what would be the specific tests that you would perform in Scenario 2, which you would not carry on Scenario 1?
	<li>Your customer does not have experience in writing Acceptance Test Plan. How will you do that in coordination with customer? What will be the contents of Acceptance Test Plan?

	<li>What are the various status reports that you need generate for Developers and Senior Management?
	<li>You have been asked to design a Defect Tracking system. Think about the fields you would specify in the defect tracking system?
	<li>Write a sample Test Policy?
	<li>Explain the various types of testing after arranging them in a chronological order?
	<li>Explain what test tools you will need for client-server testing and why?
	<li>Explain what test tools you will need for Web app testing and why?
	<li>Explain pros and cons of testing done development team and testing by an independent team?
	<li>Differentiate Validation and Verification?
	<li>Explain Stress, Load and Performance testing?
	<li>Describe automated capture/playback tools and list their benefits?
	<li>How can software QA processes be implemented without stifling productivity?
	<li>How is testing affected by object-oriented designs?
	<li>What is extreme programming and what does it have to do with testing?

	<li>You are a tester for testing a large system. The system data model is very large with many attributes and there are a lot of inter-dependencies within the fields. What steps would you use to test the system and also what are the effects of the steps you have taken on the test plan?
