require_once(),include_once() both the functions include and evalute the specified file only once<br />
and if the specified file is opened previous to the present call occurrance, it will not be done again.<br />
But require() and include() will do it as many times they are asked to do.

there shouldnt be any duplicate function names, means there should not be functions or classes or variables with the same name in abc.PHP and makeit.php

		<p>Answer of Question no 9 :</p>
	<p>The include_once() statement includes and evaluates the specified file during the execution of the script. This is a behavior similar to the include() statement, with the only difference being that if the code from a file has already been included, it will not be included again. The major difference between include() and require() is that in failure include produces a warning message whereas require produces a Fatal errors.

		<p>1) What are the differences between Get and post<br />
methods in form submitting, give the case where we can<br />
use get and we can use post methods? </p>
	<p>Ans : When you want to send short or small data,<br />
not containing ASCII characters, then you can use &#8220;GET&#8221;<br />
Method. But for long data sending say more then 100<br />
character you can use &#8220;POST&#8221; method. </p>
	<p>Once most imp diff is when you are sending the form with<br />
&#8220;Get&#8221; method. You can see the output which you are sending<br />
in the addressbar. Whereas if you send the form with &#8220;POST&#8221;<br />
method then user can not see that information.<br />
&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
	<p>2) Who is the father of PHP and explain the changes in<br />
PHP versions? </p>
	<p>Ans : Rasmus Lerdorf is the father of PHP<br />
&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
	<p>3) How can we submit a form without a submit button? </p>
	<p>Ans : I can submit a form in many ways, for e.g.<br />
1. When user click on checkbox, or drop down<br />
2. When user click on radio button<br />
3. At the end of the form I will type &#8220;Click here<br />
   to submit&#8221; &amp; link text to the processing file<br />
&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
	<p>4) In how many ways we can retrieve the date in<br />
   the result set of mysql using PHP? </p>
	<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br />
5) What is the difference between mysql_fetch_object<br />
and mysql_fetch_array?</p>
	<p>Ans :<br />
Speed-wise, the function is identical to mysql_fetch_array(),<br />
and almost as quick as mysql_fetch_row() (the difference is<br />
insignificant). </p>
	<p>mysql_fetch_object() is similar to mysql_fetch_array(),<br />
with one difference - an object is returned,<br />
instead of an array. Indirectly, that means that you can only<br />
access the data by the field names, and not by their offsets<br />
(numbers are illegal property names).<br />
&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
	<p>6) What is the difference between $message and<br />
$$message?<br />
Ans : $message is variable whereas $$message is dynamic varibale<br />
&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;

		<p>What is meant by urlencode and urldocode?<br />
string urlencode(str)<br />
where str contains a string like this &#8220;hello world&#8221; and the return value will be URL encoded and can be use to append with URLs, normaly used to appned data for GET  like someurl.com?var=hello%world<br />
string urldocode(str)<br />
this will simple decode the GET variable&#8217;s value<br />
Like it echo (urldecode($_GET_VARS[var])) will o/p &#8220;Hello world&#8221;
