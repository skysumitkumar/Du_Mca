		<p>Q1. I have a scale and 7 balls. 1 ball is heavier than all the rest. How do I determine the heaviest ball with only 3 possible weighing attempts?</p>
	<p>Answer: I can do it in 2 attempts.</p>
	<p>1. Take one out.<br />
2. Balance the 6 on the scale, 3 on each side.<br />
3. If they balance, the one sitting out is the culprit<br />
4. If one side goes down, we have narrowed down to 3 balls<br />
5. Take one out.  Now balance the two remaining.<br />
6. If they balance, the one out is the culprit.  Else the one going down is the culprit.

		<p>1. The answer for seven bass is clearly discussed before.<br />
2. Linked list has pointers, one pointer for singly linked list, two pointers for doubly linked list.<br />
3. It is easy to remove the node of linked list, hard to remove a cell of an array, you have to shift the rest cells, it will be expensive.<br />
4. You can find you data quickly in array as long as specifying the index. However, in linked list, you need start from the header, take O(N) times.<br />

		<p>Our aim is to find the ball which one is heavier.</p>
	<p>STEP 1. Take one out from the 7 balls.<br />
STEP 2. Balance (FIRST) the remaing 6 on the scale, 3 on each side.<br />
STEP 3. If they balance,that means the 6 balls are same weight.so we can say that the one sitting out is the heavier one. (Problem solved)<br />
STEP 4. if suppose the step 3 is not happen then one side of the scale goes down. that means the heavier ball is in that group. so take that 3 balls and avoid the other 4 balls.<br />
STEP 5. from the step 4 we will got 3 balls. Among these three balls took one ball and balance (SECOND) the two remaining.<br />
STEP 6. If they balance, the one out is the culprit. (Problem solved)<br />
STEP 7. if the step 6 is not happen then one going down in the scase is the heavier ball.(Problem solved)</p>
	<p>         So there are two attempts need to find out the heavier ball.

		<p>The main advantage of a linked-list over an array is the fact that a linked-list is very easy to add, or remove elements.  Like someone above mentioned an array must be allocated at compile time, which is half true.  You can re-allocate an array, but that&#8217;s exactly the problem, you either need to create a whole new array with the extra space and to copy all existing elements into it, or re-allocate inline.</p>
	<p>It&#8217;s not just about space utilization.</p>
	<p>One disadvantage of linke-lists is that they are slower to access then arrays.  One cannot rely on indexing to help maintain some data structure.  For example, a heap implementation using linked lists is far more complicated than just using an array.  It actually changes the runtime of the heap algorithm increasing it&#8217;s complexity.

		<p>Step #4 in the answer to first question needs little explanation.  Make note of the fact that in the question it is stated that one of the balls is heavier than the others.  So, the side that goes down has one ball that is heavier.  So the balls on the other side of the scale are all good.

	<p>Array can store only homogeneous content. That is objects of the same type. So type casting is not required when they are accessed from the array. But with generics in java 1.5 even collections have this feature.

		<p>Answer to the 7 balls problem :- </p>
	<p>1. First take 6 balls and weigh 3 each.<br />
If both groups are of the same wt remaining one is required ball.</p>
	<p>2. Otherwise take the group of  3 balls which is heavier and add left one to it. After that weigh   2 each. Obviously one group will be heavier as it contains the heavy ball.</p>
	<p>3. Take out the group 2 balls which are heavier and then weigh it seperately </p>
	<p>The heavier will be the required ball ..

		<p>Regarding the first questions with the balls: It can be made a lot more interesting by adding the constraint that the scale is a non-balancing scale (e.g., an electronic scale that shows the weight). You do have to assume that all balls have the same weight, except for the one heavy ball. I think you can still do it in 3 attempts, but the solution is a bit more complicated. Try it. Here is a solution. </p>
	<p>1. Take 3 balls and weigh them. The weight is Wa.<br />
2. Take 2 balls from step 1 and add 2 balls. Weigh the 4 balls. The weight is Wb.<br />
3. If Wa/3 == Wb/4 then all 5 balls are of equal weight. Therefore, one of the two remaining balls is the heavy ball. Since we know the weight of a light ball now, we need 1 weighing to figure out which one is the heavy ball.<br />
4. If Wa/3  Wb/4, then one of the three balls of step 1 is the heavy ball. Now it gets a little complicated, since we might have used the heavy ball in step 2 as well, but we don&#8217;t know at this point. Take one of the two balls of step 1 that is also used in step 2. Weigh it. This is either a heavy ball, or a light ball. Assuming it&#8217;s a light ball, solve the weight of a heavy ball in &#8220;Wlight * 2 + Wheavy = Wa&#8221;. If the assumption was wrong (i.e., if the ball was heavy), then the result will be that Wheavy

		<p>For the seven ball problem where is it given that all the other balls are equal in weight I dont think they expect us to take such assumption. So without the assumption here is the answer which requires 3 steps in the worst cases.<br />
1. Put 3 balls in one side and remaining 4 on other side . So we will get the group with the hevier ball<br />
2. now take two balls from the heavier grup on one side of the group and remaining ( 1 or 2 ) on the other side . You will now get the heavier side may it be of one ball or 2 balls .<br />
3. if you are left with a group of two then determine the heavier one by using the scale

	<li id="comment-5916">
		<p>Abhishek, your method assumes that the heavy ball is MUCH heavier than any of the other balls. It is certainly not a general solution. In general 4 balls are going to be heavier than 3 balls, so already your first step is flawed. Example: group1 = 10 + 10 + 15 = 35, group2 = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40. The heavy group is group2, but the heavy ball is in group1. </p>
	<p>To make your method work in general for all possible weight distributions the weight of the heavy ball needs to be more than 4 times the weight of the second heaviest ball (which covers the worst case senario for step 1: group1 = heavy + ~0 + ~0, group2 = Y + Y + Y + Y, where &#8220;heavy&#8221; is such that group1 &gt; group2 -&gt; heavy &gt; 4 * Y).

		<p>Step1: Divide 7 balls to two parts   4  - 3 and balance it. If 4 is heavier then 3<br />
Step 2: Divide 4 balls to two parts again 2 - 2 and balance again<br />
Step3: Select heavier part and divide again 1-1 and you find result.</p>
	<p>If part of 3 balls heavier then 4 parts<br />
Step2: divide 2- 1 balance it if 1 is heavier then 2 you success in 2 attempts<br />
Step3: is same as above</p>
	<p>Take out 1 ball out of 7 is not a proper approach because first balls might be heaviest then you can’t find out solution.

		<p>Q1. This is a trick/trap question. It encourages the candidate to make two (maybe fatal) assumptions: First that the scale is a traditional (balancing) one and second that 6 of the balls are of equal weight. The tip-off that this is a trick question is the mention of three (3) possible weighing attempts. It has been shown above that if the two assumptions are correct, the task can be done in two (2) attempts. Why inflate the possible attempts if testing a candidate&#8217;s logic? In an oral examination, this is a test in requirements gathering. Ask to clarify the assumptions. In a written exam, this is a test of managing expectations / documentation. State the assumptions, then solve the problem.

1) take one out and devide the balls into 2 batches i.e: each of 3 balls into one group and place them on the two sides of the scale.<br />
2) if they balance , then the one taken out is heaviest one other wise if one side goes down remove the other batch and the ball that is we taken out first.<br />
3) in the 2 attempt taken one ball from the three and balance the remaining two if they balance the taken out ball is the heaviest<br />

		<p>Its quite interesting to bunch of discussion going around question #1 which tests analytical skill of the candidate. The explanation by Thina in answer 9 is good enough to solve the problem.</p>
	<p>6. Yes, you should protect global data in threads, otherwise it will lead to classical problem of RACE condition as it is shared by multiple threads. This situation occurs when multiple threads concurantly access the same global data.<br />
How do you protect the data? how do you avoid such kind of situations? Well there are sveral language constructs available. It can be prevented by critical sections, mutex, semaphore depending on the situation.</p>
	<p>7. There are different ways of interfacing the database using C/C++. There are many third party libraris are available. MFC gives you CRecordSet which is simplest way to query the database and many other classes. You can also use OCI wrappers which are developed in C++. Another popular version of interfacing databases is Pro*C

		<p>Answers have already been answered if all balls are of equal weight expect one. From question<br />
if they are of different weights then and one greater than rest of weithts?<br />
1.Divide the group into 4 and 3<br />
since the heaviest ball will surely overweight the other group.<br />
Even if its in 3 ball group.<br />
2. again divide the 3 ball group into 2 and 1 here if 1 group out weighs the 2 then 1 is the heaviest above principle will apply for 4 ball group.<br />
3. In last weight you will get the the heaviest.</p>
	<p>so you solve the problem in three step except in one case. This solution also applies to<br />
balls of equal weight with one exceding the all others.

		<p>Answer #6,<br />
 A global data is considered not thread-safe and is shared among the threads. Typically, a class variable with &#8220;static&#8221; modifier is a global data that is accessible by the declared modifier, such as  &#8220;public&#8221; specifying the accessible scope and that is set as constant using the keywords &#8220;final&#8221;. For example, public static final int ACE = 1;. It is an option to finalize a data member with &#8220;final&#8221; keyword and typically not practised.<br />
 As mentioned by Murthy VVVS, it&#8217;s a race condition that leads to an inconsistent and errorneous result when a global data is not synchronised.

	<p>1) Weigh the first 3 balls.  Then weigh the second 3 balls. If their values are the same, then we can assume the 7th ball is the heaviest.  Weight that and that is done in three steps.</p>

		<p>I have a scale and 7 balls. 1 ball is heavier than all the rest. How do I determine the heaviest ball with only 3 possible weighing attempts?</p>
	<p>A:-<br />
It wouldn&#8217;t be sensible enough to consider the weights of the ball, coz what if the ball that one is comparing in the combination of<br />
CASE 1 -&gt; 20+20+20(side 1) &amp; 10+10+30(side 2) &amp;<br />
             the ball below the scale is 25<br />
//One will interpret incorrectly and land up with incorrect solution</p>
	<p>CASE 2 -&gt; 20+20+20(Side 1) &amp; 5+10+30(Side 2) &amp;<br />
             the ball below the scale is (Choose one for yourself)</p>
	<p>//You will definately be WRONG in this case try it.Coz the scale will drop on side 1 irrespective of the weight at the bottom.So if the hevigest ball is at the bottom or not, one has failed as he discards the Side 2.</p>
	<p>Thus, According to me as no details of the weight are given SIMPLY assume that are of all same size &amp; shape.</p>
	<p>Simply y Increase the complexity.Diffenitely if the weight &amp; size details were delivered the scenerio &amp; solution would have beem different.</p>

		<p>Q#6: Should you protect the global data in threads? Why or why not?</p>
	<p>Global data is shared between all the threads of a program and could lead to a &#8216;race condition&#8217; if not properly locked/synchronised. One way of handling global data in a multi-threaded program is to use &#8216;critical sections&#8217; or &#8216;mutexes&#8217; for data synchronisation.

		<p>I have a scale and 7 balls. 1 ball is heavier than all the rest. How do I determine: the heaviest ball with only 3 possible weighing attempts:</p>
	<p>Weigh six balls using a balance beam type scale. If the weight is equal, the ball not weighed is the heaviest, otherwise move to step two. We know that a ball on the right or left of the beam is heavier. Let’s assume the right is heavier. Remove one ball from the right and reweigh. If the weight is equal the removed ball is the heaviest. Otherwise the scale will tell us which is heavier. We have now solved the problem two steps versus three.
