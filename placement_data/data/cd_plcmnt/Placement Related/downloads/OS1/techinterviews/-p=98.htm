		<p>These are certainly NOT the questions which are asked in a software Tester interview. I have been in Quality engineering for 1.5 years and have given interview in prestigious companies. These are the question which might be asked to a fresher or to a programmer who wants to shoft to testing but cetainlu not to an experienced software tester.

		<p>These are more like basic programming related questions, a few about QA and some backwards ways to get at some testing knowledge, but mostly just general good questions.</p>
	<p>What seems to be missing is a &#8220;How would you test this &lt;item of choice&gt;?&#8221; with the main objectives of the question being assesement of the depth of knowledge of the testing process including realization that you not only need to test that the object meets the specifications provided to you but that the specifications are correct in the first place.</p>
	<p>Also a very important question that seemed to be brushed over in the above example is to explain a project you worked on in the past with other people. Important information to get from this project is what role the person took in the project, how the person dealt with problems that arose, how they dealt with disperity between the skill and participation level of the contributors and whether or not they thought the project was successful and why.

		<p>I just got back from a QA Testing interview, and all they asked is if I downloaded MP3&#8217;s off the net for albums I don&#8217;t own.  I said I have, and they ended the interview right there.

		<p>Please write down some questions asked during an interview for a software Development engineer in Tesst position. Most questions I have found are : How would you test a salt shaker, a toaster, elevator, pen etc. The main idea is to be able to come up with questions about what can be wrong with it.<br />
I would like to know some programming related testing questions as well.</p>
	<p>Thank you.

		<p>Previously I am asked a question like this. If I am installing a software, what would be the valid Test Cases. I have told him the Test Cases related to general navigations, performance related. But he is not satisfied. He is stressing on the most relevant Test Case which I am not aware as of now. Please find it out and tell me if possible. Looking forward for you help. </p>

		<p>Could anybody send answer for this question Please?</p>
	<p>There are 3 lights (in one room) and 3 swtiches (in another room), one for each, if you only enter into the light room once. How can you find out which switch corresponds to which light?

	<li id="comment-6404">
		<p>Here&#8217;s the answer to the 3 lights question :<br />
I will go to the room, swtich on 1 light, then wait for 10 mins or so in the same room (there is no waiting time specified), then I will switch on another light (there is no limit to how many lights you can switch on once you go into the room), the immdly goto the room where the lights actually are, touch the two illuminated lights. The one that is hotter was lighted when the 1st switch was turned on, the 2nd iluminated was with the the second switch i lighted. and the thirt switch which is off is for the light which is off.

		<p>I am going to start a qa training programme for a company. I have no idea what SQA is ? what will be my job functions and how is it as a career

		<p>To number 18:- The QA is not testing job, QA role allows you to underline the quality of the published software. may be you are going to underline the issues of software risks or quality of software performance etc.</p>
	<p>IMPORTANT:- I went to this interview where they asked me these questiosn which i would like to publish on this site.</p>
	<p>1)- If you have been asked to reduce the LifeCycle model, which phase you wouldn&#8217;t use and why<br />
2)- Where does the test phase fit in the cycle model<br />
3)- Give me any 4 types of testing methods and different between each other.<br />
4)- Which test method would you use to test Infrastructure system and why.<br />
5)- What is the different between Software Engineer and Software Tester (the reason they asked me this question because I have some Software Engineer experince and went for Software tester interview)</p>
	<p>&#8212;-&gt; Hope these question might help you for your future interview</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve been asked a very specific question on how I would test two different products (in terms of different techniques), one of which was a web-based product with a database and another one was a server-side product with no database that processes XML documents.  I have lots of experience testing front-end products, but not as much of the back-end.  I said that I would emulate data flow with some script (like a Perl script) and verify the system output. I mentioned unit test for code coverage, back-end scripts that would capture performance and load issues.  And then I said I&#8217;d run integrated tests with client software.  I think my interviewer expected something else.  What are the specific techniques for testing GUI-less products?  Please advise.

		<p>I am currently a QA Analyst with a small software company and was not asked many of the questions listed above when I was interviewed.  They seem to be geared more to engineers rather than testers.  I can recommend an excellent book on software testing called &#8220;Testing Computer Software&#8221; Second Edition by Cem Kaner.  It describes many of the things people have asked about in this forum.  He also offers a free online course that is very good at <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.testingeducation.org/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.testingeducation.org/'" tppabs="http://www.testingeducation.org/" rel='nofollow'>http://www.testingeducation.org/</a><br />
Here&#8217;s a link to a qa forums site although they haze people if they post questions about test/interview questions.  Use the search feature and you will get much more than you expected.  <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.qaforums.com/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.qaforums.com/'" tppabs="http://www.qaforums.com/" rel='nofollow'>http://www.qaforums.com/</a><br />

		<p>Some of the questions posted have some legal implications that definitely need to be pointed out.</p>
	<p>What kind of PC games you like most? Why?<br />
      Just because the general belief that there is a high correlation between engineers and gamers doesn&#8217;t mean that if they play games they will be any better or any worse than a non-gamer. This questions would for sure get an interviewer into the courts based on non-relavent job information being asked</p>
	<p>How long would you stay with us?</p>
	<p>This taps into contract employment rather than at-will employment. Who cares how long an employee stays with you, they need not make a commitment because the employer will make no qualms letting the employee go due to &#8220;at-will&#8221;. Make sure your questions are job relavent and applicable to the tasks&#8230;
