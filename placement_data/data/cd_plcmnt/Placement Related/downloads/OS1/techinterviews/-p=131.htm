		<p>7- How do you restore single tables from backup in SQL Server 7.0/2000? In SQL Server 6.5?</p>
	<p>This opportunity is no longer supported in SQL Server 7.0/2000 . But you can create new filegroup and place a table in it. Because SQL Server can restore both files and filegroups, you can restore only that table.<br />
In SQL 6.5 the LOAD TABLE statement allows this.
