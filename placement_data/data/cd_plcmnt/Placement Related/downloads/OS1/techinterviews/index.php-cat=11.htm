			<ol>
<li><b>What are the basic functions of an operating system?</b> - Operating system controls and coordinates the use of the hardware among the various applications programs for various uses. Operating system acts as resource allocator and manager. Since there are many possibly conflicting requests for resources the operating system must decide which requests are allocated resources to operating the computer system efficiently and fairly. Also operating system is control program which controls the user programs to prevent errors and improper use of the computer. It is especially concerned with the operation and control of I/O devices.</li>
	<li><b>Why paging is used?</b> - Paging is solution to external fragmentation problem which is to permit the logical address space of a process to be noncontiguous, thus allowing a process to be allocating physical memory wherever the latter is available.</li>
	<li><b>While running DOS on a PC, which command would be used to duplicate the entire diskette?</b> diskcopy</li>

	<ol>
<li><b>What is a Microprocessor?</b> - Microprocessor is a program-controlled device, which fetches the instructions from memory, decodes and executes the instructions. Most Micro Processor are single- chip devices.	</li>
	<li><b>Give examples for 8 / 16 / 32 bit Microprocessor?</b> - 8-bit Processor - 8085 / Z80 / 6800; 16-bit Processor - 8086 / 68000 / Z8000; 32-bit Processor - 80386 / 80486. </li>
	<li><b>Why 8085 processor is called an 8 bit processor?</b> - Because 8085 processor has 8 bit ALU (Arithmetic Logic Review). Similarly 8086 processor has 16 bit ALU. </li>
