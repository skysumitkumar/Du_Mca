			<ol>
<li>I understand the company has experienced layoffs within the last two years. Can you review the reasons why they were necessary?</li>
	<li>How were the layoffs handled in terms of notification, severance, outplacement services, etc.?</li>
	<li>What rewards have you found effective in recognizing and rewarding exceptional work?</li>
	<li>Are there formal metrics in place for measuring and rewarding performance over time?</li>
	<li>How effectively has the company communicated its top three business goals?</li>
<a id="more-194"></a></p>
	<li>I am a hard worker, and like to be around hard-working people. Am I going to be comfortable with the level of effort I find here?</li>
	<li>Is the company&#8217;s training strategy linked to the company&#8217;s core business objectives?</li>
	<li>How does your firm handle recognition for a job well done?</li>
	<li>When was the last time you rewarded a subordinate for his or her efforts? What token of appreciation did you offer?</li>
	<li>How does the firm recognize and learn from a brave attempt that didn&#8217;t turn out quite as expected?</li>
	<li>If I were a spectacular success in this position after six months, what would I have accomplished?</li>
	<li>How much freedom would I have in determining my objectives and deadlines?</li>
	<li>How long has this position existed in the organization? Has its scope changed recently?</li>
	<li>Do you foresee this job involving significant amounts of overtime or work on weekends?</li>

	<li>What percentage of the total profit from the company does it generate? Is it increasing or decreasing?</li>
	<li>What&#8217;s your company&#8217;s &#8220;killer application&#8221;? What percentage of the market share does it have? Will I be working on it?</li>
	<li>Can you give me some examples of the best and worst aspects of the company&#8217;s culture?</li>
	<li>What makes this company a great place to work? What outside evidence (rankings or awards) do you have to prove this is a great place to work? What is the company going to do in the next year to make it better?</li>
	<li>What would I see if I stood outside the front door at five o&#8217;clock?</li>
	<li>Would people be smiling? Staying late or leaving early? Would everyone be taking work home?</li>
	<li>Lots of your competitors have great products and people programs. What is the deciding factor that makes this opportunity superior? Are you able to say any things that you will do to make this a great experience for me if I accept the position?</li>
	<li>Can you show me that the company has a diverse workforce and that it is tolerant of individual differences? Does it have affinity groups or similar programs that I might find beneficial? Is there a dress code?</li>
	<li>Can you give me an example of any &#8220;outrageous conduct&#8221; this firm tolerates the competitors would not?</li>
	<li>Does your company offer any &#8220;wow!&#8221; benefits? Does it pay for advanced degrees? Does it offer paid sabbaticals? On-site child care?</li>
	<li>Relocation packages? Mentor programs? How are these superior to those of your competitors? What about job sharing? Flex-time arrangements? Telecommuting? Workout facilities?</li>
	<li>When top performers leave the company, why do they leave and where do they usually go?</li>
	<li>When was the last significant layoff? What criteria were used to select those to stay?</li>

		<p>I was extremely impressed with the thoughtful questions listed above, with selective use of the questions will definitely allow you to gain insight into your employer while make a impression with your prepared research and eagerness to find out if the company is truly somewhere you want to work, and not just some company you hope to get some experience. Questions are divided into questions that can be asked to find out if they seriously consider your qualification, questions to understand company culture and policies, flaming questions that are sticky to ask but can be a way to honest evaluate the advantage and disadvantage and questions to see if you and the manager will be pair up sucessfully as a team.
