			<ol>
	<li><b>What is a modifier?</b> A modifier, also called a modifying function is a member function that<br />
changes the value of at least one data member. In other words, an<br />
operation that modifies the state of an object. Modifiers are also<br />
known as &#8216;mutators&#8217;. Example: The function mod is a modifier in the<br />
following code snippet:</p>
	<blockquote><pre>
class test
{
    int x,y;
    public:
    	test()
    	{
       		x=0; y=0;
    	}
	void mod()
    	{
	       x=10;
	       y=15;
    	}
};
</pre></blockquote>
	</li>
<a id="more-110"></a></p>
	<li><b>What is an accessor?</b> An accessor is a class operation that<br />
does not modify the state of an object. The accessor functions need to<br />
be declared as const operations
</li>
	<li><b>Differentiate between a template class and class template. </b><br />
Template class: A generic definition or a parameterized class not<br />
instantiated until the client provides the needed information. It&#8217;s<br />
jargon for plain templates. Class template: A class template specifies<br />
how individual classes can be constructed much like the way a class<br />
specifies how individual objects can be constructed. It&#8217;s jargon for<br />
plain classes.
</li>
	<li><b>When does a name clash occur?</b> A name clash occurs<br />
when a name is defined in more than one place. For example., two<br />
different class libraries could give two different classes the same<br />
name. If you try to use many class libraries at the same time, there is<br />
a fair chance that you will be unable to compile or link the program<br />
because of name clashes.
</li>
	<li><b>Define namespace.</b> It is a feature in C++ to<br />
minimize name collisions in the global name space. This namespace<br />
keyword assigns a distinct name to a library that allows other<br />
libraries to use the same identifier names without creating any name<br />
collisions. Furthermore, the compiler uses the namespace signature for<br />
differentiating the definitions.
</li>
	<li><b>What is the use of &#8216;using&#8217; declaration.</b><br />
A using declaration makes it possible to use a name from a namespace without the scope operator.
</li>
	<li><b>What is an Iterator class?</b> A class that is used to<br />
traverse through the objects maintained by a container class. There are<br />
five categories of iterators: input iterators, output iterators,<br />
forward iterators, bidirectional iterators, random access. An iterator<br />
is an entity that gives access to the contents of a container object<br />
without violating encapsulation constraints. Access to the contents is<br />
granted on a one-at-a-time basis in order. The order can be storage<br />
order (as in lists and queues) or some arbitrary order (as in array<br />
indices) or according to some ordering relation (as in an ordered<br />
binary tree). The iterator is a construct, which provides an interface<br />
that, when called, yields either the next element in the container, or<br />
some value denoting the fact that there are no more elements to<br />
examine. Iterators hide the details of access to and update of the<br />
elements of a container class.<br />
The simplest and safest iterators are those that permit read-only access to the contents of a container class.
</li>
	<li><b>List out some of the OODBMS available.</b> GEMSTONE/OPAL<br />
of Gemstone systems, ONTOS of Ontos, Objectivity of Objectivity Inc,<br />
Versant of Versant object technology, Object store of Object Design,<br />

	<li><b> What is an incomplete type? </b>Incomplete types<br />
refers to pointers in which there is non availability of the<br />
implementation of the referenced location or it points to some location<br />
whose value is not available for modification.</p>
	<blockquote><pre>
	int *i=0x400  // i points to address 400
	*i=0;        //set the value of memory location pointed by i.
</pre></blockquote>
	<p>Incomplete types are otherwise called uninitialized pointers.</p>
</li>
	<li><b>What is a dangling pointer?</b><br />
A dangling pointer arises when you use the address of an object after<br />
its lifetime is over. This may occur in situations like returning<br />
addresses of the automatic variables from a function or using the<br />
address of the memory block after it is freed. The following<br />
code snippet shows this:</p>
	<blockquote><pre>
class Sample
{
public:
        int *ptr;
        Sample(int i)
        {
	        ptr = new int(i);
        }
	
        ~Sample()
        {
	        delete ptr;
        }
        void PrintVal()
        {
	        cout &lt;&lt; \"The value is \" &lt;&lt; *ptr;
        }
};
	
void SomeFunc(Sample x)
{
	cout &lt;&lt; \"Say i am in someFunc \" &lt;&lt; endl;
}
	
int main()
{
	Sample s1 = 10;
	SomeFunc(s1);
	s1.PrintVal();
}
</pre></blockquote>
	<p>In the above example when PrintVal() function is<br />
called it is called by the pointer that has been freed by the<br />
destructor in SomeFunc. </p>
</li>
	<li><b>Differentiate between the message and method.</b><br />
<i>Message</i>:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Objects communicate by sending messages to each other.</li>
	<li>A message is sent to invoke a method.</li>
	</ul>
	<p><i>Method</i></p>
	<ul>
	<li>Provides response to a message.</li>
	<li>It is an implementation of an operation.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><b>What is an adaptor class or Wrapper class?</b><br />
A class that has no functionality of its own. Its member functions hide<br />
the use of a third party software component or an object with the<br />
non-compatible interface or a non-object-oriented implementation.
</li>
	<li><b>What is a Null object?</b> It is an object of some<br />
class whose purpose is to indicate that a real object of that class<br />
does not exist. One common use for a null object is a return value from<br />
a member function that is supposed to return an object with some<br />
specified properties but cannot find such an object.
</li>
	<li><b>What is class invariant?</b> A class invariant is a<br />
condition that defines all valid states for an object. It is a logical<br />
condition to ensure the correct working of a class. Class invariants<br />
must hold when an object is created, and they must be preserved under<br />
all operations of the class. In particular all class invariants are<br />
both preconditions and post-conditions for all operations or member<br />
functions of the class.
</li>
	<li><b>What do you mean by Stack unwinding?</b> It is a<br />
process during exception handling when the destructor is called for all<br />
local objects between the place where the exception was thrown and<br />
where it is caught.
</li>
	<li><b>Define precondition and post-condition to a member function.</b><br />
Precondition: A precondition is a condition that must be true on entry<br />
to a member function. A class is used correctly if preconditions are<br />
never false. An operation is not responsible for doing anything<br />
sensible if its precondition fails to hold. For example, the interface<br />
invariants of stack class say nothing about pushing yet another element<br />
on a stack that is already full. We say that isful() is a precondition<br />
of the push operation. Post-condition: A post-condition is a condition<br />
that must be true on exit from a member function if the precondition<br />
was valid on entry to that function. A class is implemented correctly<br />
if post-conditions are never false. For example, after pushing an<br />
element on the stack, we know that isempty() must necessarily hold.<br />
This is a post-condition of the push operation.
</li>
	<li><b>What are the conditions that have to be met for a condition to be an invariant of the class?</b>
	<ul>
	<li>The condition should hold at the end of every constructor.</li>
	<li>The condition should hold at the end of every mutator (non-const) operation.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><b>What are proxy objects?</b> Objects that stand for other objects are called proxy objects or surrogates.<br />
	<blockquote><pre>
template &lt;class t=&quot;&quot;&gt;
class Array2D
{
	public:
        class Array1D
        {
         public:
          T&amp; operator[] (int index);
          const T&amp; operator[] (int index)const;
        };
	
        Array1D operator[] (int index);
        const Array1D operator[] (int index) const;
};
</pre></blockquote>
	<p>The following then becomes legal:</p>
	<blockquote><pre>
Array2D&lt;float&gt;data(10,20);
cout&lt;&lt;data[3][6];     //  fine
</pre></blockquote>
	<p>Here data[3] yields an Array1D object<br />
and the operator [] invocation on that object yields the float in<br />
position(3,6) of the original two dimensional array. Clients of the<br />
Array2D class need not be aware of the presence of the Array1D class.<br />
Objects of this latter class stand for one-dimensional array objects<br />
that, conceptually, do not exist for clients of Array2D. Such clients<br />
program as if they were using real, live, two-dimensional arrays. Each<br />
Array1D object stands for a one-dimensional array that is absent from a<br />
conceptual model used by the clients of Array2D. In the above example,<br />
Array1D is a proxy class. Its instances stand for one-dimensional<br />
arrays that, conceptually, do not exist. </p>
</li>
	<li><b>Name some pure object oriented languages.</b> Smalltalk, Java, Eiffel,  Sather.
</li>
	<li><b>Name the operators that cannot be overloaded.</b> sizeof, ., .*, .-&gt;, ::, ?: <i>Salam</i> in the comments notes that -&gt; <b>can</b> be overloaded.
</li>
	<li><b>What is a node class?</b> A node class is a class that,
	<ul>
	<li>relies on the base class for services and implementation,</li>
	<li>provides a wider interface to the users than its base class,</li>
	<li>relies primarily on virtual functions in its public interface</li>
	<li>depends on all its direct and indirect base class</li>
	<li>can be understood only in the context of the base class</li>
	<li>can be used as base for further derivation</li>
	<li>can be used to create objects.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>A node class is a class that has added new services or functionality beyond the services inherited from its base class.
</p>
</li>
	<li><b>What is an orthogonal base class?</b><br />
If two base classes have no overlapping methods or data they are said<br />
to be independent of, or orthogonal to each other. Orthogonal in the<br />
sense means that two classes operate in different dimensions and do not<br />
interfere with each other in any way. The same derived class may<br />
inherit such classes with no difficulty.
</li>
	<li><b>What is a container class? What are the types of container classes?</b>
	<p>A container class is a class that is used to hold objects in memory or<br />
external storage. A container class acts as a generic holder. A<br />
container class has a predefined behavior and a well-known interface. A<br />
container class is a supporting class whose purpose is to hide the<br />
topology used for maintaining the list of objects in memory. When a<br />
container class contains a group of mixed objects, the container is<br />
called a heterogeneous container; when the container is holding a group<br />
of objects that are all the same, the container is called a homogeneous<br />
container.

		<p>The example that you are giving here is not correct as per my undertstanding.<br />
Reason. When you call SomeFunc method - you pass and object by value, So a local object is constructed which is bitwise copied from the object that we are passing.<br />
  The destructor called is that of the local one and not the original<br />
one.<br />
 Please correct it.</p>

A dangling pointer arises when you use the address of an object after<br />

addresses of the automatic variables from a function or using the<br />
address of the memory block after it is freed. The following<br />

{<br />
public:<br />
        int *ptr;<br />
        Sample(int i)<br />
        {<br />
	        ptr = new int(i);<br />
        }</p>
	<p>~Sample() { delete ptr; } void PrintVal() { cout << “The value is ” << *ptr; } };</p>
	<p>void SomeFunc(Sample x) { cout << “Say i am in someFunc ” << endl; }</p>
	<p>int main() { Sample s1 = 10; SomeFunc(s1); s1.PrintVal(); }</p>
	<p>In the above example when PrintVal() function is<br />
called it is called by the pointer that has been freed by the<br />
destructor in SomeFunc.

		<p>In #17, I would think that if a queue isful() that you cannot push another element to it, and after pushing an element onto the stack that isempty() would not be true.  You have the conditions reversed.

		<p>In #20, Java is mentioned as pure OOL. I don&#8217;t think this is true. Because, for a language to be pure object oriented, all the datatypes should be objects and this is not true with the basic datatypes in java(int,char,etc)

		<p>&#8220;Differentiate between a template class and class template.<br />
Template class: A generic definition or a parameterized class not<br />
instantiated until the client provides the needed information. It’s<br />
jargon for plain templates. Class template: A class template specifies<br />
how individual classes can be constructed much like the way a class<br />
specifies how individual objects can be constructed. It’s jargon for<br />
plain classes.&#8221;</p>
	<p>This is directly in conflict with how these terms are used in the C++ standard: In fact, it&#8217;s the other way around: Class templates are templates (as a function templates), and template classes is basically a deprecated expression (almost gone from the 2003 C++ standard), and has been used both as a synonym for class template, and for classes made (instantiated) from templates, hence classes.</p>
	<p>To be interview questions, I think they should at least agree with the standard, and how today&#8217;s experts define the terms.</p>
	<p>The point about Java being pure OO has been mentioned, so I won&#8217;t reiterate that argument.</p>
	<p>&#8220;What is an incomplete type? Incomplete types<br />
refers to pointers in which there is non availability of the<br />
implementation of the referenced location or it points to some location<br />
whose value is not available for modification.</p>
	<p>	int *i=0&#215;400  // i points to address 400<br />
	*i=0;        //set the value of memory location pointed by i.<br />
Incomplete types are otherwise called uninitialized pointers.&#8221;</p>
	<p>This sounds really confused, and lead to criticism at the comp.lang.c++.moderated newsgroup. An incomplete type is unambiguously a type that hasn&#8217;t been completely defined, e.g.:</p>
	<p>class c;</p>
	<p>(&#8221;void&#8221; is also an incomplete type)</p>
	<p>It has nothing to do with pointers or initialisation.

		<p>Hi Anish,<br />
Regarding your comment. It is actually an error even if it is passed by value because, the pointer address is copied and not the value and it is destructed. so the address is still there pointing to nothing. Writing a copy contructor that does deep copy will avoid this.
