	<li><b>How do you switch to DOS prompt from SQL prompt?</b> SQL> host </li>
	<li><b>How do I eliminate duplicate rows in an Oracle database? </b><br />
	<blockquote><p>SQL> delete from table_name where rowid not in (select max(rowid) from table group by duplicate_values_field_name);</p></blockquote>
	<p>or </p>
	<blockquote><p>SQL> delete duplicate_values_field_name dv from table_name ta where rowid < (select min(rowid)  from table_name tb where ta.dv=tb.dv);</blockquote>

	<li><b>Explain explicit cursor attributes.</b> There are four cursor attributes used in Oracle: cursor_name%Found, cursor_name%NOTFOUND, cursor_name%ROWCOUNT, cursor_name%ISOPEN</li>
	<li><b>Explain implicit cursor attributes.</b> Same as explicit cursor but prefixed by the word SQL: SQL%Found, SQL%NOTFOUND, SQL%ROWCOUNT, SQL%ISOPEN </li>
	<li><b>How do you view version information in Oracle?</b><br />
