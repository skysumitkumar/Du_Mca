<li><b>What is the difference between procedural and object-oriented programs?</b>- a) In procedural program, programming logic follows certain procedures and the instructions are executed one after another. In OOP program, unit of program is object, which is nothing but combination of data and code. b) In procedural program, data is exposed to the whole program whereas in OOPs program, it is accessible with in the object and which in turn assures the security of the code.</li>
	<li><b>What are Encapsulation, Inheritance and Polymorphism?</b>- Encapsulation is the mechanism that binds together code and data it manipulates and keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse. Inheritance is the process by which one object acquires the properties of another object. Polymorphism is the feature that allows one interface to be used for general class actions.</li>
	<li><b>What is the difference between Assignment and Initialization?</b>- Assignment can be done as many times as desired whereas initialization can be done only once.</li>
