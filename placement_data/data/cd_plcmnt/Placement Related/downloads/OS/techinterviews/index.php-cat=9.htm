			<p>Submitter said questions were asked in a US company hiring a Web developer.</p>
	<ol>
<li><b>Explain the .NET architecture.</b></li>
	<li><b>How many languages .NET is supporting now?</b> - When .NET was introduced it came with several languages. VB.NET, C#, COBOL and Perl, etc. The site DotNetLanguages.Net <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.dotnetlanguages.net/DNL/Resources.aspx  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.dotnetlanguages.net/DNL/Resources.aspx'" tppabs="http://www.dotnetlanguages.net/DNL/Resources.aspx">says 44 languages are supported</a>.</li>
	<li><b>How is .NET able to support multiple languages?</b> - a language should comply with the Common Language Runtime standard to become a .NET language. In .NET, code is compiled to Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL for short). This is called as Managed Code. This Managed code is run in .NET environment. So after compilation to this IL the language is not a barrier. A code can call or use a function written in another language.</li>

			<p>Useful for preparation, but too specific to be used in the interview.</p>
	<ol>
<li><b> Is it possible to inline assembly or IL in C# code? </b> - No. </li>
	<li><b> Is it possible to have different access modifiers on the get/set methods of a property? </b> - No. The access modifier on a property applies to both its get and set accessors. What you need to do if you want them to be different is make the property read-only (by only providing a get accessor) and create a private/internal set method that is separate from the property. </li>

	<ol>
<li><b> Are private class-level variables inherited? </b> - Yes, but they are not accessible, so looking at it you can honestly say that they are not inherited. But they are. </li>
	<li><b> Why does DllImport not work for me? </b> - All methods marked with the DllImport attribute must be marked as public static extern. </li>
