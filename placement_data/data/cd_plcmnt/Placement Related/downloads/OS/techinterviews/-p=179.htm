		<p>What is the difference between VB 6 and VB.NET?<br />
1.The concept of the complete flow of execution of a program from start to finish: Visual Basic<br />
hides this aspect of programs from you, so that the only elements of a Visual Basic program you<br />
code are the event handlers and any methods in class modules. C# makes the complete program<br />
available to you as source code. The reason for this has to do with the fact that C# can be seen,<br />
philosophically, as next-generation C++. The roots of C++ go back to the 1960s and predate windowed<br />
user interfaces and sophisticated operating systems. C++ evolved as a low-level, closeto-<br />
the-machine, all-purpose language. To write GUI applications with C++ meant that you had<br />
to invoke the system calls to create and interact with the windowed forms. C# has been<br />
designed to build on this tradition while simplifying and modernizing C++, to combine the<br />
low-level performance benefits of C++ with the ease of coding in Visual Basic. Visual Basic, on<br />
the other hand, is designed specifically for rapid application development of Windows GUI<br />
applications. For this reason, in Visual Basic all the GUI boilerplate code is hidden, and all the<br />
Visual Basic programmer implements are the event handlers. In C# on the other hand, this boilerplate<br />
code is exposed as part of your source code.<br />
2. Classes and inheritance: C# is a genuine object-oriented language, unlike Visual Basic, requiring<br />
all code to be a part of a class. It also includes extensive support for implementation inheritance.<br />
Indeed, most well-designed C# programs will be very much designed around this form of<br />
inheritance, which is completely absent in Visual Basic.

		<p>What is Serialization in .NET?</p>
	<p>When developing smaller applications that do not have a database (or other formal storage mechanism) or data that doesn&#8217;t need to be stored in a database (such as the state of a web application), you often still would like to save the data for later retrieval. There are many ways to do this, but many of them are subject to a lot of extra code (work) and extra time spent debugging. With .NET, there is now an easy way to add this functionality to your code with only a few lines of easily tested code. This easy way is called serialization.</p>
	<p>Serialization is the process of storing an object, including all of its public and private fields, to a stream. Deserialization is the opposite – restoring an object&#8217;s field values from a stream. The stream is generally in the form of a FileStream, but does not have to be. It could be a memory stream or any other object that is of type IO.Stream. The format can be anything from XML to binary to SOAP.
