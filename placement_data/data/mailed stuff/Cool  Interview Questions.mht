  <P>
  <P>The technical interview is perhaps the most intimidating and =
mysterious=20
  event that job hunters experience in the quest for that "killer =
offer." The=20
  rigor and format of the technical interview varies from one company to =
the=20
  next, but there are some fundamental similarities. An interviewer =
presents you=20
  with a problem to be solved. The interviewer may leave the room and =
give you=20
  some time to work the solution out before returning. Or the =
interviewer may=20
  wait patiently while you study the problem and figure it out. The =
interviewer=20
  may even start quizzing you right away about aspects of the problem =
and=20
  approaches to solving it. Some of these problems can appear quite =
challenging,=20
  especially if you've never been through a technical interview before. =
To make=20
  matters worse, simply getting the answer to the problem may not be =
enough to=20
  land the job. On the other hand, getting the correct answer may not =
even be=20
  necessary. What is an interviewer looking for in candidates during the =

  technical interview? Interviewers recognize that this setting is, by =
its very=20
  nature, stressful. Otherwise competent candidates may be completely =
stumped by=20
  an interview problem only to discover an elegant, simple solution =
later that=20
  night. Interviewers may be interested in seeing how you work under =
stressful=20
  situations or how well you adapt. It is worth noting that interviewers =
are=20
  more interested in seeing how you work than seeing whether you can =
come up=20
  with the correct answer. In this article, I will deal with both how =

  <P>
  <P>These basic rules are often taught to programmers and are (or at =

some=20
  reason, however, they are easily forgotten during the technical =
interview.=20
  Being one of the few candidates careful and experienced enough to =
remember=20
  these important steps can make the difference between getting an offer =
and=20
  getting the cold shoulder. Don't be afraid to ask for clarifications =
of the=20
  problem or the requirements for the solution. <BR><IMG=20

  <P>
  <P>You should never assume that you have been given all the data =
necessary to=20
  solve the problem to the satisfaction of the interviewer. This is =
especially=20
  likely to be the case when interviewing with IT consulting companies. =
In this=20
  environment, the client may need some prodding in order to provide a =
complete=20
  specification. So, the reasoning goes, ideal candidates will be =
willing to=20
  talk to the client to figure out the expected inputs, the desired =
outputs, the=20
  data ranges and data types, and the special cases. The ideal candidate =
will=20
  ask these questions rather than spend all the allotted time coming up =
with a=20
  solution that doesn't meet the client's needs. The first thing to do, =
then, is=20
  to make sure that you and the interviewer agree on what the problem is =
and=20
  what an acceptable solution would be. Make all of your assumptions =
explicit=20
  and up-front, so the interviewer can correct you if you are mistaken. =

  <P>
  <P>If the interviewer stays in the room after presenting the problem, =
he or=20

  frankly, watching a candidate sit and stare at a problem isn't all =
that=20

  worst thing that you can do while attempting to solve a technical =
problem is=20
  to dive right into coding a solution and get about half way through it =
before=20

solution.=20
  The idea, the algorithm, and the approach are the most important =
elements=20
  here. If you're having trouble writing the code, offer to explain the=20

  than it needs to be. If you find yourself having difficulty with =
programming=20
  syntax or constructs, you should make sure that the interviewer knows =
that you=20
  understand the problem and its solution. While it's best to get both =
the=20

  Just because you've found one solution that produces the correct =

point.=20
  Occasionally, you may take an approach that the interviewer didn't =

  At this point, an interviewer may ask you to take a more conventional=20
  approach. This doesn't mean that you've done anything wrong; very =
often, an=20

  <P>For the sake of this problem, assume that the string has been =

  punctuation (including spaces), and has been converted to a single =
case. The=20
  most efficient way to detect whether a string is a palindrome is to =
create two=20
  pointers. Set one at the beginning of the string, and one at the end. =
Compare=20
  the values at those locations. If the values don't match, the string =
isn't a=20
  palindrome. Otherwise, move each pointer inward and repeat the =
comparison.=20
  Stop when the pointers are pointing to the same position in the string =
(if its=20

  <P>
  <P>Assume that the file format is one byte for every pixel in the =

  that the approximation will produce one ASCII character of output for =
each=20

the=20
  tricks used in technical interview questions. Problems may be obscured =
or made=20
  to sound difficult. Don't be fooled! Take the time to think about the =
core of=20
  the problem. In this case, all you want is an algorithm for reading =
the values=20
  in a file and outputting characters based upon those values.=20
  <P>Eight-bit numbers can be in the range from 0 to 255. Two-bit =
numbers are in=20
  the range from 0 to 3. Basically, we want to divide the 256 numbers =
specified=20
  by an eight-bit number into four ranges, which can be indicated by a =
two-bit=20
  number. So, divide the range of 0 to 255 uniformly into four separate =
ranges:=20
  0 to 63, 64 to 127, 128 to 191, and 192 to 255.=20
  <P>You then have to assign an ASCII character to each of those four =
ranges of=20
  numbers. For example, you could use "_", "~", "+", and "#". Then, the=20
  algorithm is as follows: <PRE>1.	Open the file.
2.	For every byte in the file:
a.	Read in one byte.
b.	If the value is in the range 0..63, we'll print '_'.
c.	If the value is in the range 64..127, we'll print '~'.
d.	If the value is in the range 128..191, we'll print '+'.
e.	If the value is in the range 192..255, we'll print '#'.
3.	Close the file.

  <P>Exceptions are in the mainstream of C++ now, so most programmers, =
if they=20

idioms=20
  return a program from the nested depths of multiple function calls to =
a=20
  defined position higher in the program. The program stack is "unwound" =
so that=20
  the state of the program with respect to function calls and pushed =
arguments=20

  <P>The code has two built-in pitfalls. First, if it executes in a =
member=20
  function for an extern, static, or automatic object, the program will =
probably=20
  crash as soon as the delete statement executes. There is no portable =
way for=20
  an object to tell that it was instantiated on the heap, so the class =
cannot=20
  assert that its object is properly instantiated. Second, when an =
object=20

demise.=20
  As far as the instantiating program is concerned, the object remains =

Subsequent=20
  dereferencing of the pointer can and usually does lead to disaster.=20
  <P>A reader pointed out that a class can ensure that its objects are=20

  <P>A constructor that has no arguments or one where all the arguments =
have=20

  <P>If you don't code a default constructor, the compiler provides one =
if there=20

  <P>
  <P>A constructor that accepts one argument of a different type.=20
  <P>The compiler uses this idiom as one way to infer conversion rules =
for a=20
  class. A constructor with more than one argument and with default =
argument=20

  <LI><B>What is the difference between a copy constructor and an =
overloaded=20
  assignment operator? </B></A>
  <P>
  <P>A copy constructor constructs a new object by using the content of =
the=20
  argument object. An overloaded assignment operator assigns the =
contents of an=20
  existing object to another existing object of the same class.=20
  <P>First, you must know that a copy constructor is one that has only =
one=20
  argument, which is a reference to the same type as the constructor. =
The=20
  compiler invokes a copy constructor wherever it needs to make a copy =
of the=20
  object, for example to pass an argument by value. If you do not =
provide a copy=20
  constructor, the compiler creates a member-by-member copy constructor =
for you.=20

  <P>You can write overloaded assignment operators that take arguments =
of other=20
  classes, but that behavior is usually implemented with implicit =
conversion=20
  constructors. If you do not provide an overloaded assignment operator =
for the=20
  class, the compiler creates a default member-by-member assignment =
operator.=20
  <P>This discussion is a good place to get into why classes need copy=20
  constructors and overloaded assignment operators. By discussing the=20
  requirements with respect to data member pointers that point to =
dynamically=20
  allocated resources, you demonstrate a good grasp of the problem. =

This=20

  Employee "has a" Salary, therefore the Employee class has the HASA=20

  <P>The answer to this question reveals whether you have an =

  <P>There are other relationships. The USESA relationship is when one =
