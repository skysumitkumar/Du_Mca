</PRE><STRONG>Question 4 :</STRONG> <PRE>	Why is testing a less efficient method for finding defects than
	a code review?

        a) Code reviews use an automatic testing tool to find defects
           in a program, whereas in traditional testing, the programmer
           must hand-code tests
        b) Testing focuses on the symptoms of problems, whereas,
           code reviews focus on the actual problem
        c) Testing takes longer because it finds all of the defects,
           whereas, code reviews only find some of the defects
        d) Its not.  Testing is *more* efficient than code reviews
