<BODY><PRE></PRE><STRONG>Question 0 :</STRONG> <PRE>	Which of the following is NOT a good characteristic of a hash
function?

        a)  Easy to compute
        b)  Uniform distribution
        c)  Frequent collisions
        d)  Handles various sized key spaces

</PRE><STRONG>Question 1 :</STRONG> <PRE>	Which of the following is true of open hashing (separate chaining)?

        a) All data is stored in the table array directly.
	b) The algorithm running times are due to "probes" of 
             different table cells until an empty one is found  
	c) Many elements can be stored at the same table cell
	d) None of the above

</PRE><STRONG>Question 2 :</STRONG> <PRE>	Linear probing is:

        a) A means of searching down a linked list stored at a
            hash table cell 
        b) A secondary hash function based on a quadratic formula
        c) A method to increase the size of the hash table dynamically 
	d) none of the above
<EM>Answer:</EM>
   d
</PRE><STRONG>Question 3 :</STRONG> <PRE>	Suppose you want to insert the date October 13 into the hash
table below.  The hash function uses the month number (e.g., January =
1, February = 2, etc.) to generate the position, and quadratic probing is
used to resolve collisions.  Into which bucket will the date October
13 be placed?  (Note, the table is listed across two columns, and October's
month number is 10.)

   a
</PRE><STRONG>Question 4 :</STRONG> <PRE>	Consider the following hash table.  The hash function uses the
month number (e.g., January = 1, February = 2, etc.) to generate the
position.  What evidence in this table supports the fact that linear
probing was used to resolve collisions?  (Note, the table is listed 
across two columns.)

	1 Jan 27	8 Aug 6
	2 		9 Aug 9
	3 Mar 29	10 Oct 9
	4 Apr 1		11 Aug 12
	5 Mar 3		12 Sept 1 
	6 		13
       
	a) Similar months tend to be clustered together
	   (eg, Aug 6 and Aug 9)
	b) The placement of Aug 12 in slot 11 and the placement of Sept 1 
	  in slot 12. Quadratic probing would have placed Sept 1 in slot 13 
	  in the event that slots 8-11 were *already* occupied.
	c) Both a and b
	d) There are some adjacent blank spaces (entries 6 and 7)
	e) The dates in 8 and 9 are in order by day
	f) both d and e

   c
</PRE><STRONG>Question 5 :</STRONG> <PRE>	What is one disadvantage of quadratic probing as a hash scheme?

	a) insertions can actually fail even if there are empty
	   entries left
	b) you have to check whether or not a node needs to be split
	c) memory usage increases with each insertion 
	d) primary clustering can degrade performance 
<EM>Answer:</EM>
   a
</PRE><STRONG>Question 6 :</STRONG> <PRE> 	Which of these is not a closed hash table probing method?

        a) Linear Probing
        b) Quadratic Probing 
        c) Double Hashing
        d) Extendible Hashing
<EM>Answer:</EM>
   d
</PRE><STRONG>Question 7 :</STRONG> <PRE>	What is a disadvantage of linear probing?

	a) Can allocate a lot of extra memory
	b) you tend to get primary clustering if the hashing function 
           is not uniform
	c) the algorithm is difficult to program
	d) none of the above
<EM>Answer:</EM>
   b
</PRE><STRONG>Question 8 :</STRONG> <PRE>	If a hash table using closed hashing (open addressing) becomes 
        full, you have to:

	a) replace the least frequently addressed entry
	b) sort the linked lists 
        c) copy the entries into a new, larger table
	d) closed hash tables don't fill up

<EM>Answer:</EM>

</PRE><STRONG>Question 9 :</STRONG> <PRE>        Which of the following is true of separate chaining (open hashing)?

        a) All data is stored in the table array directly.
        b) Multiple data can be stored in the same bucket
        c) A secondary hash function is needed
        d) Using a "cellar" improves performance
        e) None of the above
