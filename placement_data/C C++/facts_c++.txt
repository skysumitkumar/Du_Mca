take three variable naming hour, minute and second and use delay function. delay function take argument as time increment the second variable with every 1 second and increment the minute variable with every 60 seconds and same hour with every 60 minutes in a loop

what is the size of a structure??                                C++ Comm

If the struct has a virtual method then the size of virtual pointer will also be added. 

Size of structure depends on many factors:
# Size of all non-static data members
# Order of data members
# Byte alignment or byte padding
# Size of its immediate base class
# The existence of virtual function(s) (Dynamic polymorphism using virtual functions).
# Compiler being used
# Mode of inheritance (virtual inheritance)

By default, it will be always divisible by 4:

struct { char x[1]; }; = size 4
struct { char x[4]; }; = size 4
struct { char x[5]; }; = size 8
struct { char x[8]; }; = size 8
struct { char x[9]; }; = size 12
...

There is a way to compact it:
#pragma pack(1)
Then all struct will have the exact sum of it's elements.

u r given pointer to a binary tree,                                  DS PUZZLES Comm
u have to balance that tree,
without changin the data structure,

variation:
now u r given a binary search tree 




balance(node* root)
{
if(!root)
....return;
balance(root->left);
balance(root->right);
if(depth(root->left)-depth(root->right)>1)
....rotateRight(root);
if(depth(root->right)-depth(root->left)>1)
....rotateLeft(root);
}

Here we use a bottom up approach ...
rotateRight() and rotateLeft() are functions which rotate and depth is a fucntion which finds the depth of the tree....

When is the memory for the class allocated?                             c++ comm
#include <iostream>

class X
{
};

main()
{
X x;
}

Taking a small dummy example, Does the memory for the class X is allocated inside the main() function or before it?




Memory is not allocated for class. Memory is allocated for object.

It is allocated at this point->X x; 



if u look at class, which is infact is a data type so no allocation for Class.. 

if u look at the book by stroustrup, it says the object for empty class will be allocated 1 byte of memory. 


actually each class has atleast one parent 'object', thats while declaring d empty class also requires memory as it inherit the objects of its parent class 'object'.

how do I force the user to input an int?                                 C++ COMM
por exemple, I need something like this:

int a;

if (a "is an integer")
cin >> a;
else
cout << "only integers accepted" << endl;


ANS : 

int main() {
int number = 0;
cin >> number;
cin.ignore(numeric_limits<int>::max(), '\n');

if (!cin || cin.gcount() != 1)
{
//code
}
else
{
//code
}
return 0;
}


INCORRECT ANS : 
if(!cin>>number){
//code
}
else
{
//code
} 
//This won't flag 3.5 or 3X as invalid. 

==============================================================================================

to find for given number if its a 
multiple of 3 or 5 or 7 etc. Condition is that u have to not use /,*, 
and %. Following are a few methods for that:- 
1) Method 1:- discovered by Tullu, if that of using  a finite automata. 
I this we do prepocessing of building the automata and then we scan the 
bits from HSb to LSb and make transitions accordingly. The final state 
we land into tells if the number was multiple or not. I think that this 
method is the best when we have infinite stream of bits and we cannot 
store the bits. But when only an int is given it would be a little 
expensive to use this method. 

2)Method 2:- go on subtracting the divisor(3 or 5 or 7) from the number 
and if u reach a negative number without encountering 0, the number was 
not multiple and 0 was encountered, it was multiple. This looks simple 
but uses loop and so takes time varying with the number being checked 
for. 


3)Method 3 :-(this is the method i thought of and led me to start this 
discussion). 
Notice, the divisors(3,5,7) rae such that they are at a distance of one 
from a power of two. 
Now take example of 5:- given a number N. if its divisible by 5 then it 
can be represented as 4*(N/5) + N/5. 
1. Find the multiple of 4 just less than N(simply clear the 2LSbs in N) 
2. take the difference of N with the number found in 1. 
3. multiply it the difference with 4(left shift it by 2). 
4. now check if numbers found in 1 and 3 are same or not(take their 
XOR), if same divisible by 5 else not. 


Example:- 
N=eleven = 1011 
1.multiple just smaller then 1011 = 1000 
2.do 1011^1000 = 0011 
3.multiply by 4 =(0011)<<2= 1100 
4.check if same (1000^1100) no => not a multiple. 


N=15=1111 
1.multiple smaller than 1111= 1100 
2.do 1111^1100= 0011 
3.multiply by 4= 1100 
4.1100^1100=0000, so a multiple of 5. 


wat say guys? This method takes O(1) time, i.e. it doesn't have any 
loop,no extra space as well.
